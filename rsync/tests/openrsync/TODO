Next flags to test:
-l symbolic links # done
-t times # done
-r recursive (as in, do not for the test) # done
- atimes
- see whether chmod goes to umask # done
Then:
- include (and mix with exclude)
- include-from / exclude-from
  Make sure the +/- syntax inside the file is implemented
  Make sure that --include=- works for stdin
  Error on ! in include file
Then:
- max-size
- min-size
- specials (actually use the pipe)
Later:
- server mode
- -x (requires root and needs to be portable to macOS)

Postphone testing these options:
-g group - would introduce a dependency on groups on the machine
-o owner - would introduce a dependency on groups on the machine and
           would have to run uid root
Also test:
- group symbolic and group by number, which requires a second machine
  with different groups
