.Sh NAME
.Nm rsyncd.conf
.Nd configuration format for the rsync daemon
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When the
.Xr rsync 1
.Fl -daemon
mode starts up, it first reads its global configuration from a file located by
default at
.Pa /etc/rsyncd.conf ,
unless the
.Fl -config
option is specified to direct
.Xr rsync 1
to look elsewhere.
In this first pass of reading
.Nm ,
only the leading global configuration is read.
.Nm
is read once again when a client connects to the daemon, this time loading
module parameters specified later in the file.
.Ss FILE FORMAT
.Nm
files bare close resemblance to the commonly-found INI file format.
Unless otherwise noted, leading whitespace on lines is not significant and will
be ignored.
.Pp
Comments are supported on their own lines, and begin with a
.Sq #
character.
.Pp
A line containing a declaration like
.Dq [module]
indicates that the following lines belong to the module named between the
square brackets.
Leading and trailing whitespace in the module name are stripped.
Internal whitespace is collapsed down to or transformed into a single space
character.
Multiple sections for a module are merged together as one would expect.
.Pp
Assignments are lines that look like
.Dq key = value ,
where the key is everything before a
.Sq = ,
and the value may contain spaces or
.Sq =
characters unescaped.
Quotation marks are used literally in the value configured, not interpreted in
any special way.
The value may span multiple lines by "escaping" the newline with a \\
character at the end.
.Pp
Value assignments that occur before any module section are global options, which
may influence how the
.Xr rsync 1
starts up or provide default values for module parameters described later.
.Nm
supports sections named
.Dq global ,
which may also provide default values for module parameters.
.Ss GLOBAL OPTIONS
The following keys may be assigned before any module sections, and will
influence
.Xr rsync 1
daemon startup:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Dq address
Provides an address to bind the listening socket to, if not otherwise specified
by the
.Fl -address
option to
.Xr rsync 1 .
By default,
.Xr rsync 1
will bind to any address on the system.
.It Dq motd file
Names a file containing a MOTD that will be printed to clients as they connect
to the
.Xr rsync 1
daemon.
This file will be read every time a client is connected, so a daemon restart is
not required to update the MOTD.
.It Dq pid file
Names a file to write the
.Xr rsync 1
pid to.
This file will be locked while the daemon is still running, preventing other
daemons configured to use the same pid file from starting.
.It Dq port
Provides a port to bind the listening socket to, if not otherwise specified by
the
.Fl -port
option to
.Xr rsync 1 .
By default,
.Xr rsync 1
will bind to the
.Dq rsync
port as described in
.Pa /etc/services ,
which is traditionally port 873.
.It Dq socket options
Defines socket options to set on both the listening socket and accepted client
sockets, unless overridden by the
.Fl -sockopts
option to
.Xr rsync 1 .
.El
.Ss MODULE PARAMETERS
The following keys may be assigned within module sections declared in
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Dq path
Names the path on the filesystem that
.Xr rsync 1
will serve files for this module from.
.It Dq use chroot
Boolean value describing whether
.Xr rsync 1
should
.Xr chroot 2
itself into the named
.Dq path .
By default,
.Xr rsync 1
will attempt to
.Xr chroot 2 ,
but if it fails due to
.Er EPERM
then it will proceed anyways.
This fallback does not happen if
.Dq use chroot
is explicitly set to true
in
.Nm .
.El
.Pp
.Dq path
is the only required field for a module.
.Sh EXAMPLES
A basic configuration for the
.Xr rsync 1
daemon to listen on *:9998 serving files out of /var/ftp/pub:
.Bd -literal
# These settings affect rsync(1) startup
port = 9998
motd file = /etc/rsync.motd

[ftp]
  # This is only used when the 'ftp' module is requested
  path = /var/ftp/pub
.Ed
.Pp
Listen on the usual port, serving files out of the same directory as above:
.Bd -literal
# This also affects all modules
use chroot = yes

# Alternative spelling of the above:
#[global]
#  use chroot = yes

[ftp]
  path = /var/ftp/pub
.Ed
.Sh BUGS
Syntax errors in
.Nm
that occur at or after the first module declaration will not be detected until
a client has attempted to connect.
.Pp
Module names are case sensitive when requested by the client, but are not case
sensitive when specified in
.Nm .
The client may request a module by the casing used in the first appearance of
the module, not by any casing used in subsequent sections describing the same
module.
.Pp
Line continuation escapes using \\ at the end of a line are only recognized as
continuations if they occur in the middle of a value assignment.
.Pp
Leading whitespace in a value is insignificant as long as it occurs on the same
line as the =.
Whitespace on the next line, whether a significant character in the value was
written on the previous line or not, is significant and will appear in the
value.
.Pp
.Nm
supports sections named
.Dq global
to define global defaults for some values, but this name is somewhat misleading
as they are not read in for
.Xr rsync 1
daemon startup.
As such, global options like
.Dq port
or
.Dq pid file
appearing in a
.Dq [global]
section will not affect the
.Xr rsync 1
daemon startup.
