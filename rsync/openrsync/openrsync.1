.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility synchronises files in the destination
.Ar directory
with one or more
.Ar source
files.
Either the
.Ar source
or the destination
.Ar directory
may be remote,
but not both.
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4 , -ipv4
Use IPv4 when connecting to a remote host, or binding to a local address.
If
.Nm
is configured to use an
.Fl -rsh
program named
.Dq ssh ,
then it will pass
.Fl 4
to it.
.It Fl 6 , -ipv6
Use IPv6 when connecting to a remote host, or binding to a local address.
As with the
.Fl 4
option,
.Nm
will pass
.Fl 6
to the
.Fl -rsh
program if it is named
.Dq ssh .
.It Fl a , -archive
Shorthand for
.Fl Dgloprt .
.It Fl -address Ns = Ns Ar sourceaddr
When connecting to an rsync daemon, use
.Ar sourceaddr
as the source address for connections, which is useful on machines with
multiple interfaces.
.It Fl -append
If the destination file exists and is shorter than the source file then rsync
will append the difference to the destination file.
If after the transfer the whole-file checksums do not match then the
destination file will be updated via the usual block-based delta-merge
protocol.
This option implies
.Fl -inplace .
.It Fl b , -backup
Make a backup of changed files with ~ suffix.
.It Fl -backup-dir Ar directory
When combined with the
.Fl -backup
flag,
.Nm
will store backups of files being replaced in the designated backup directory on
the receiving side.
Can be combined with the
.Fl -suffix
flag to name the backup files with a suffix.
The default is to not append a suffix.
.Pp
If specified as a relative path, the backup directory will be contained within
the copied tree, and may cause conflicts or be subject to
.Fl -delete
rules.
It is advised to use an absolute path outside of the copied tree, or a relative
path such as "../".
.It Fl B , -block-size Ns = Ns Ar BLOCKSIZE
Specify the block size to be used for file transfers.  The upper bound
is 512M, but it is enforced only if a differential transfer is required.
.It Fl -blocking-io
This flag is ignored by openrsync, but is accepted for compatibility.
.It Fl -bwlimit Ar limit
Limit transfer speed to
.Ar limit
bytes/sec.
The
.Ar limit
may also contain any of the suffixes described in the
.Fl -max-size
definition of size.
.It Fl -cache
Use the operating system buffer cache when reading and writing files.
This is the default on all operating systems except macOS, where
.Nm
sets
.Dv F_NOCACHE
by default to limit memory growth.
Setting this option will enabling caching by not setting any flags.
.It Fl -no-cache
Sets
.Dv O_DIRECT
when reading and writing files to avoid using the buffer cache.
Setting this option can avoid filling the cache with files that will not be
read again, such as during a backup.
This is the default on macOS, where
.Dv F_NOCACHE
is used instead of
.Dv O_DIRECT .
.It Fl c , -checksum
Use full-file checksums to determine which files have changed and should
be transferred, rather than the usual file size and modification time
"quick check".
.It Fl -checksum-seed Ns = Ns Ar NUM
Use
.Ar NUM
as the seed for both the 4-byte block and MD4 file checksums.
By default,
.Ar NUM
is randomly generated, but if set to zero directs
.Nm
to use
.Ar time(3)
as the checksum seed.
.It Fl -compare-dest Ns = Ns Ar directory
Use directory as an alternate base directory to compare files against on the
destination machine.
If file in
.Ar directory
is found and identical to the sender's file, the file will not be transferred.
Multiple
.Fl -compare-dest
directories may be provided.
If
.Ar directory
is a relative path, it is relative to the destination directory.
.It Fl -contimeout Ns = Ns Ar seconds
Set the connection timeout in seconds.
Exit if no connection established within the specified time.
The default is 0, which means no timeout.
.It Fl -copy-dest Ns = Ns Ar directory
Use directory as an alternate base directory to compare files against on the
destination machine.
If file in
.Ar directory
is found and identical to the sender's file, the file will be locally copied.
Multiple
.Fl -copy-dest
directories may be provided.
If
.Ar directory
is a relative path, it is relative to the destination directory.
.It Fl L , -copy-links
Copy targets of symbolic links, rather than the link itself.
.It Fl -copy-unsafe-links
Copy targets of symbolic links that are unsafe (absolute symlinks or where the
target reaches outside the copied tree).
.It Fl k , -copy-dirlinks
Copy targets of symbolic links that point to directories only.
.It Fl C , Fl -cvs-exclude
Exclude a common list of files as CVS would.
The patterns deployed are specifically:
.Bl -column -offset indent ".make.state" ".nse_depinfo" "*.BAK" "CVS.adm"
.It RCS         Ta SCCS         Ta CVS   Ta CVS.adm
.It RCSLOG      Ta cvslog.*     Ta tags  Ta TAGS
.It .make.state Ta .nse_depinfo Ta *~    Ta #*
.It .#*         Ta ,*           Ta _$*   Ta *$
.It *.old       Ta *.bak        Ta *.BAK Ta *.orig
.It *.rej       Ta .del-*       Ta *.a   Ta *.olb
.It *.o         Ta *.obj        Ta *.so  Ta *.exe
.It *.Z         Ta *.elc        Ta *.ln  Ta core
.It .svn/       Ta              Ta       Ta
.El
Followed by any patterns included in
.Pa $HOME/.cvsignore
and the
.Ev CVSIGNORE
environment variable.
.Pp
The
.Fl C
flag also adds a
.Dq dir-merge
CVS rule to include per-dir
.Pa .cvsignore
files.
All of these rules are appended to the end of the filter list with the
equivalent of specifying
.Fl f Dq Ar -C
.Fl f Dq Ar :C .
.It Fl D
Also transfer device and special files.
Shorthand for
.Fl -devices -specials .
.It Fl -del , -delete
Delete files in
.Ar directory
not found in
.Ar source
directories.
Only applicable with
.Fl r .
.It Fl -delay-updates
Delay updates of (only) plain files until all other operations
are complete.
This is done to be more atomic.
Requires extra space in the destination directory up to the amount of the
whole tree.
.It Fl -delete-before
Execute the above described
.Fl -delete
behavior before the transfer begins.
This is the default timing when
.It Fl -delete
is used.
This option is mutually exclusive with
.Fl -delete-during ,
.Fl -delete-delay ,
and
.Fl -delete-after .
.It Fl -delete-during
Execute the above described
.Fl -delete
behavior as the transfer happens, right before each directory to be transferred
is checked for updates.
This option is mutually exclusive with
.Fl -delete-before ,
.Fl -delete-delay ,
and
.Fl -delete-after .
.It Fl -delete-delay
Execute the above described
.Fl -delete
behavior after the transfer happens, but collect the list to be deleted right
before each directory to be transferred is checked for updates.
This option is mutually exclusive with
.Fl -delete-before ,
.Fl -delete-during ,
and
.Fl -delete-after .
.It Fl -delete-after
Execute the above described
.Fl -delete
behavior after the transfer has completed.
This option is mutually exclusive with
.Fl -delete-before ,
.Fl -delete-during ,
and
.Fl -delete-delay .
.It Fl -delete-excluded
When used in combination with any one of the above
.Fl -delete
options, supplied
.Fl -exclude
patterns will not prevent a file from being deleted.
.It Fl -exclude Ar pattern
Exclude files matching
.Em pattern .
.It Fl -exclude-from Ns = Ns Ar file
Load
.Em patterns
and
.Em rules
from
.Em file .
.It Fl E , -executability
Preserve the executability of regular files (i.e., a file is "executable" if
at least one 'x' mode bit is enabled in its permissions).
If the source file is executable, then for each 'r' mode bit enabled in the
destination file's permissions, the corresponding 'x' mode bit will be enabled.
If the source file is not executable then all ugo 'x' mode bits of the destination
file will be disabled.
This option has no effect if
.Fl -perms
is also specified.
.It Fl 0 , -from0
Use a null (\&'\e0\&') character, rather than a newline to separate filenames read from:
.Fl -exclude-from ,
.Fl -include-from ,
.Fl -files-from ,
and any merged files specified in
.Fl -filter
rules.
Does not affect
.Fl -cvs-exclude .
.It Fl -files-from Ns = Ns Ar filespec
Load list of files to transfer (as opposed to the
command line)
from
.Em filespec .
.Ar Filespec
can be of the form hostname:port:path.
.It Fl -force
Force deletion of non-empty directories about to be replaced
by a non-directory.
This option has no effect if any of the
.Fl -delete 
options are present.
.It Fl -ignore-errors
Works in conjunction with
.Fl -delete
to delete files despite I/O errors.
.It Fl y , Fl -fuzzy
Look for files in the destination directory that might be the same to use as a
basis to avoid copying the entire file.
The first file with an identical size and modification time is used to try to
reduce the total amount of data that has to be transferred.
.Pp
Note that the use of the
.Fl -delete
option might get rid of any potential fuzzy-matches, so either use
.Fl -delete-after
or specify some exclusions to prevent this.
.It Fl -ignore-existing
Ignore files that already exist.
.It Fl -ignore-non-existing , Fl -existing
Ignore files that do not already exist (do not create them).
.It Fl I , -ignore-times
Do not skip based on file size and modification time.
.It Fl -include Ar pattern
Include files matching
.Em pattern .
.It Fl -include-from Ns = Ns Ar file
Load
.Em patterns
and
.Em rules
from
.Em file .
.It Fl -devices
Also transfer device files.
.It Fl e Ar program , Fl -rsh Ns = Ns Ar program
Specify alternative communication program, defaults to
.Xr ssh 1 .
The
.Ev RSYNC_RSH
environment variable will be used if an
.Fl e
option is not present.
Note that
.Nm
will generally handle quotes, but it makes no attempt to deal with escape
sequences.
In particular, escaped quotation marks will not be escaped.
.It Fl F
Adds a standard
.Pa .rsync-filter
dir-merge filter rule.
Specifically,
.Fl F
will add
.Dq : /.rsync-filter
the first time it is seen, and
.Dq - .rsync-filter
the second time it is seen.
Subsequent uses have no effect.
.It Fl f Ar filter , Fl -filter Ns = Ns Ar filter
Process
.Ar filter
against the global filter chain.
The specified
.Ar filter
may be a rule to include a filter file, or to include a per-directory filter
file.
Regular filter files are processed immediately, while per-directory filter files
are processed as directories are encountered.
See
.Sx PATTERNS AND RULES
for more details about the syntax and capabilities of
.Nm
filters.
.It Fl g , -group
Set the group name to match the source.
For example, group
.Qq kristaps
with ID 1000 on a remote server is matched to group
.Qq kristaps
on the local machine with ID 2000.
If
.Fl -numeric-ids
is also given or if the remote group name is unknown on the local machine,
set the numeric group ID to match the source instead.
.It Fl H , -hard-links
Attempt to preserve hard links within the list of files transferred.
.It Fl h, --human-readable
Display numbers of bytes in human readable units.
If specified once, uses units of 1000, if specified twice uses units of 1024.
.It Fl -help
Print a brief description of all options.
.It Fl l , -links
Also transfer symbolic links.
The link is transferred as a standalone file: if the destination does
not exist, it will be broken.
.It Fl -inplace
Avoid creating temporary files, instead operating on files directly in place
in the destination.
This option has some notable trade-offs that must be considered prior to using
it.
For example, hardlinks will not be broken even if a file is no longer hardlinked
in the source directory.
.It Fl -keep-dirlinks
When a directory is sent, and the receiving side has a symlink to a
directory in that place, follow that symlink and place the directory's
contents in that symlinked dir.
.It Fl -link-dest Ns = Ns Ar directory
Use directory as an alternate base directory to compare files against on the
destination machine.
If file in
.Ar directory
is found and identical to the sender's file, the file will be hardlinked.
Multiple
.Fl -compare-dest
directories may be provided.
If
.Ar directory
is a relative path, it is relative to the destination directory.
.It Fl -max-size Ar size
Don't transfer any file that is larger than
.Ar size
bytes.
Alternatively
.Ar size
may instead use a multiplier (such as
0B, 100B, 1023B, 1K, 1.5K, 5.5M; or any sequence with a case-insensitive
terminal scale multiplier of B, K, M, G, T, P, or E; corresponding to bytes,
kilobytes, and so on)
to specify the size.
.It Fl -min-size Ar size
Don't transfer any file that is smaller than
.Ar size
bytes.
See
.Fl -max-size
on the definition of size.
.It Fl -modify-window Ar sec
When comparing file modification times for the purpose of speeding up
transfers consider offsets of up to
.Ar sec
seconds the same.
.It Fl n , -dry-run
Do not actually modify the destination.
Mainly useful in combination with
.Fl v .
.It Fl -no-motd
Do not display the Message of the Day.
.It Fl -numeric-ids
Ignore user and group names, use numeric user and group IDs only.
Has no effect unless
.Fl g
or
.Fl o
is also given.
.It Fl O , -omit-dir-times
Do not perserve the modification times of directories.
This can be expensive when the directories reside on NFS.
This option is inferred if you use
.Fl -backup
without
.Fl -backup-dir .
.It Fl o , -owner
Set the user name to match the source, with similar matching logic as for
.Fl g .
If
.Fl -numeric-ids
is also given or if the remote user name is unknown on the local machine,
set the numeric user ID to match the source instead.
Only works if run as root.
.It Fl P
Shorthand for
.Fl -partial
.Fl -progress .
.It Fl p , -perms
Set destination file or directory permissions to match the source when
it is updated.
.It Fl -partial
Do not remove partially transferred files if
.Nm
is interrupted, which opens up the possibility for them to be easily resumed
later.
.It Fl -password-file Ns = Ns Ar pwfile
Define a file to read the password from when connecting to an rsync daemon.
The password should be written on the first line of the file, and may have a
terminating newline.
The
.Ar pwfile
is expected to not be readable by 'other', and to be owned by root if
.Nm
is running as root.
.It Fl -port Ns = Ns Ar service
Specify an alternative TCP port number.
The
.Ar service
can be given as a decimal integer or as a name to be looked up in the
.Xr services 5
database.
The default is
.Dq rsync .
.It Fl q , -quiet
Suppress all non-error related informational messages.
.It Fl -progress
Periodically report file transfer progress.
.It Fl r , -recursive
If
.Ar source
designates a directory, synchronise the directory and the entire subtree
connected at that point.
If
.Ar source
ends with a slash, only the subtree is synchronised, not the
.Ar source
directory itself.
If
.Ar source
is a file, this has no effect.
.It Fl -read-batch Ns = Ns Ar file
Read a batch file previously prepared by
.Nm
from
.Ar file .
See the
.Fl -write-batch
option for a description of a batch file.
When reading a batch file, the
.Ar source
arguments are optional and ignored if specified.
.It Fl -remove-source-files
Remove
.Ar source
files as they are transferred into
.Ar directory .
Files are only removed once they are confirmed to be fully in place.
By default
.Nm
will delete files as the transfer progresses, but given its asynchronous nature
there may be a noticeable delay between a given file finishing its transfer and
its subsequent removal.
.Pp
When combined with
.Fl -delay-updates ,
files will be removed in a larger batch toward the end of the transfer.
.It Fl R , -relative
Normally, pathnames on the commandline omit the directory components.
This option will include the dir components.
.It Fl -rsync-path Ns = Ns Ar program
Run
.Ar program
on the remote host instead of the default
.Pa rsync .
.It Fl -size-only
Skip files whose sizes match (regardless of timestamp).
.It Fl -safe-links
Skip any symlinks that are unsafe (absolute symlinks or where the target is
outside the copied tree).
.It Fl -sockopts Ns = Ns Ar sockopts
Set custom
.Ar sockopts
on the socket created to communicate with an rsync daemon.
.Ar sockopts
should be of the form
.Dq name Ns Oo = Ns value Oc Ns Oo , Ns ... Oc ,
where
.Ar name
matches an
.Dv SO_*
option described in
.Xr setsockopt 2 .
Note that only the following options are currently supported:
.Bl -column SO_REUSEADDR -offset indent
.It Dv SO_KEEPALIVE
.It Dv SO_REUSEADDR
.It Dv SO_SNDBUF
.It Dv SO_RCVBUF
.It Dv SO_SNDLOWAT
.It Dv SO_RCVLOWAT
.It Dv SO_SNDTIMEO
.It Dv SO_RCVTIMEO
.It Dv SO_REUSEPORT
May not be available on all systems.
.El
.It Fl S , -sparse
Attempt to efficiently handle sparse files.
.It Fl -specials
Also transfer fifo and unix domain socket files.
.It Fl -suffix Ar suffix
Sets the suffix to be appended to filenames when creating backups on the
receiver before replacing files.
Defaults to ~ except when combined with
.Fl -backup-dir
where the default is an empty string.
.It Fl -super
Always attempt traditionally super-user activities.
This flag mostly interacts with the
.Fl -owner ,
.Fl -group ,
and
.Fl -devices
options, which may be permitted to unprivileged users on the receiving end in
some configurations.
.Fl -no-super
is also supported to avoid them entirely.
.It Fl T , -temp-dir Ns = Ns Ar directory
Instead of creating temporarily files in the destination directory, create
them in the specified temporary directory.
If this directory is on a different filesystem, that will require moving
the file rather than renaming it into place, and is therefore not atomic.
.It Fl -timeout Ns = Ns Ar seconds
Set the I/O timeout in seconds.
Exit if no data was transferred for the specified time.
The default is 0, which means no timeout.
.It Fl t , -times
Set destination file and directory modification time to match the source
when it is updated or created.
.It Fl u , -update
Skip existing files on the destination that have a modification time newer
than the source file.
.It Fl v , -verbose
Increase verbosity.
Specify once for files being transferred, twice for specific status,
thrice for per-file transfer information, and four times for per-file
breakdowns.
.It Fl x , -one-file-system
Do not cross filesystem boundaries.
If this option is repeated, all mount point directories from the copy are
omitted.
Otherwise, it includes an empty directory at each mount point it encounters.
.It Fl V , -version
Print version and exit.
.It Fl W , -whole-file
Copy the entire file rather than using the rsync incremental algorithm.
This option may be faster, especially if the network link is faster than the disk.
.It Fl -only-write-batch Ns = Ns Ar file
Prepare a batch file and write it to
.Ar file .
With this option, the batch file is written without updating the destination.
See the below
.Fl -write-batch
option for a description of a batch file.
.It Fl -write-batch Ns = Ns Ar file
Prepare a batch file and write it to
.Ar file .
A batch file is composed of a small heading describing the transfer parameters
negotiated, followed by a raw dump of the data transmitted by the sender.
When used with
.Fl -read-batch
on the other side, the transfer is simply replayed from the batch file against
the application's reeceiver, and the destination tree is updated accordingly.
.Pp
Batch files are intended to reproduce an update to a destination tree to many
other identical trees without needing to establish a direct connection between
them.
This mechanism also avoids having to perform many of the intermediate steps
required for a transfer, such as receiver-side checksums and blocking.
.El
.Pp
A remote
.Ar source
or
.Ar directory
has the syntax
.Ar host : Ns Ar path
for connecting via
.Xr ssh 1 ,
or
.Cm rsync Ns :// Ns Ar host Ns / Ns Ar path
or
.Ar host Ns :: Ns Ar path
for connecting to a remote daemon.
Subsequent to the first remote
.Ar source ,
the host may be dropped to become just
.Pf : Ar path
or
.Pf :: Ar path .
.Pp
For connecting to a remote daemon with
.Cm rsync Ns :// Ns Ar host
or
.Ar host Ns :: Ns Ar path ,
the first path component is interpreted as a
.Qq module :
.Ar host Ns :: Ns Ar module Ns / Ns Ar path .
This only applies to the first
.Ar source
invocation; subsequent to that, the module should not be specified.
.Pp
By default, new destination files and directories are given the current
time and the source file permissions.
Updated files retain their existing permissions.
It is an error if updated files have their file types change (e.g.,
updating a directory with a file).
.Pp
At this time,
.Ar source
may only consist of regular files, directories
.Pq only with Fl r ,
or symbolic links
.Pq only with Fl l .
The destination
.Ar directory
must be a directory and is created if not found.
.Pp
.Nm
also supports a
.Fl -daemon
mode, which may be run either standalone or may be invoked by, e.g.,
.Xr inetd 8
or similar services that hand a socket off to an external program for handling.
.Pp
Daemon options that are shared with the non-daemon mode of
.Nm
behave as described above.
Options specified to daemon mode are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl -config Ns = Ns Ar configfile
Load daemon configuration from the named
.Ar configfile
instead of the default location.
By default,
.Nm
will look for its configuration at
.Pa /etc/rsyncd.conf .
See
.Xr rsyncd.conf 5
for details of the format of this file.
.It Fl -no-detach
Run the
.Nm
daemon in the foreground, instead of the background.
.El
.Pp
Note that the
.Nm
daemon mode will log to
.Xr syslog 3
by default unless
.Fl -log-file
is specified, regardless of whether
.Fl -no-detach
has been specified to run in the foreground or not.
.Sh PATTERNS AND RULES
The
.Fl f ,
.Fl -include ,
.Fl -include-from ,
.Fl -exclude ,
and
.Fl -exclude-from
options may be used to load a filter rule or a set of filter rules.
A single filter rule consists of a
.Ar type ,
an optional set of
.Ar modifiers ,
and a
.Ar pattern .
Each
.Ar type
has a short name and a long name.
These will be described in more depth shortly.
.Pp
A filter file is a set of rules, one per line.
Comments are accepted, starting with a
.Sq # .
Empty lines are ignored.
.Pp
Each rule is of the following form:
.Bd -literal
<TYPE>[,<MODIFIERS>] <PATTERN>
.Ed
.Pp
If the short name is used, then the comma separating the modifiers from the rule
type is optional.
The delimiter between the type/modifiers and the pattern may also be an
underbar instead of a space.
.Pp
The following rule types are supported:
.Bl -column -offset indent "LONG NAME" "SHORT NAME" "DESCRIPTION"
.It LONG NAME Ta SHORT NAME Ta DESCRIPTION
.It exclude   Ta - Ta Exclude a file from the transfer
.It include   Ta + Ta Include a file from the transfer
.It merge     Ta . Ta Merge rules in from a file
.It dir-merge Ta : Ta Merge rules in from a per-directory file
.It hide      Ta H Ta Hide a file from the transfer
.It show      Ta S Ta Do not hide a file from the transfer
.It protect   Ta P Ta Protect a file from deletion
.It risk      Ta R Ta Do not protect a file from deletion

.El
.Pp
The following rule modifiers are supported for the
.Dq exclude
and
.Dq include
rule types:
.Bl -column -offset indent "MODIFIER" "DESCRIPTION"
.It MODIFIER Ta DESCRIPTION
.It / Ta Match against the absolute pathname of the entry
.It ! Ta Take effect if the pattern does not match the entry
.It C Ta Insert the global CVS exclusions
.It s Ta Marks a rule as sender-side only
.It r Ta Marks a rule as receiver-side only
.It p Ta Marks a rule as perishable (do not prevent removal of a directory)
.El
.Pp
The above modifiers will be ignored if applied to other rule types, with the
exception of
.Dq merge
and
.Dq dir-merge
rules.
See the
.Sx Merge Rules
section for more details of the semantics.
.Ss Include and Exclude Rules
The six basic types of include and exclude rules briefly described above are
.Dq exclude ,
.Dq include ,
.Dq hide ,
.Dq show ,
.Dq protect ,
.Dq risk .
.Pp
The
.Dq hide
and
.Dq show
types are sender-side versions of the
.Dq exclude
and
.Dq include
rules, while the
.Dq protect
and
.Dq risk
types are their receiver-side equivalents.
.Pp
Each of these rules take a pattern that is typically matched against the
basename of a transfer candidate's name.
A trailing
.Sq /
in the pattern indicates that the entry should only match a directory name,
while a leading
.Sq /
indicates that the pattern is anchored to the beginning of the transfer path.
The beginning of the transfer path is either the root of the transfer, or the
directory containing a dir-merge file if the rule in question comes from a
dir-merge file.
A
.Sq /
at any other position, or a
.Dq **
in the pattern, will match against the full path to the transfer entry beginning
at the root of the transfer.
.Pp
Patterns may contain any of the following wildcards.
.Bl -column -offset indent "WILDCARD" "DESCRIPTION"
.It WILDCARD Ta DESCRIPTION
.It ?        Ta Matches any character, except Sq /
.It *        Ta Matches zero or more characters, except Sq /
.It **       Ta Matches zero or more characters
.It [        Ta Character class, as in POSIX regular expressions
.It /***     Ta Matches a directory and all of its contents
.El
.Pp
Backslashes may be used to escape one of the above wildcard characters, but is
ordinary when appearing before any other character.
.Pp
Note that exclude rules with the
.Dq C
modifier applied do not take a pattern.
.Ss Merge Rules
The merge rules,
.Dq merge
and
.Dq dir-merge ,
are another way to insert a filter rule file.
.Dq merge
rules are evaluated once as soon as they are processed, and the rules read in
are inserted at the same position as the merge file.
.Dq dir-merge
rules are evaluated as
.Nm
progresses through the file list, searching each directory encountered for the
file named in the rule's pattern.
.Pp
If a
.Dq dir-merge
rule appears before a
.Dq clear
rule, it will not be processed at all.
.Pp
.Dq dir-merge
rules are inserted into their own chain of rules, rather than directly into the
global ruleset.
.Dq clear
rules appearing in a dir-merged file do not affect the global ruleset.
As we find dir-merged files in the transfer, their rules are prepended to their
dir-merge chain so that a deeper directory's rules take precedence over its
parent's rules.
.Pp
When one of the above exclude/include modifiers are applied to
.Dq merge
or
.Dq dir-merge
rule, those modifiers are applied to the exclude/include rules within the file.
The following modifiers may additionally be specified for merge rules:
.Bl -column -offset indent "MODIFIER" "DESCRIPTION"
.It MODIFIER Ta DESCRIPTION
.It -        Ta All rules within are exclude rules
.It +        Ta All rules within are include rules
.It C        Ta File processing should assume CVS-compatible parsing
.It e        Ta Exclude the file's name from the transfer
.It n        Ta Rules are not inherited by subdirectories
.It w        Ta Rules are word-split instead of line-split
.El
.Pp
The CVS-compatible modifier implies the
.Sq - ,
.Sq n
and
.Sq w
modifiers.
If a filename is not supplied with it, then
.Dq .cvsignore
is used.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect execution of
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width "RSYNC_PASSWORD"
.It Ev LOGNAME
This variable may also hold the username to use when connecting to an rsync
daemon.
If
.Ev LOGNAME
is not set, then
.Dq nobody
will be used.
.It Ev USER
This variable holds the username to use when connecting to an rsync daemon.
If
.Ev USER
is not set, then
.Ev LOGNAME
will be used.
.It Ev RSYNC_RSH
This variable specifies the remote shell to use for remote connections.
The default remote shell is
.Xr ssh 1
if neither
.Ev RSYNC_RSH
nor
.Fl -rsh
are specified.
.It Ev RSYNC_PASSWORD
This variable specifies the password to use when connecting to an rsync daemon.
It will be ignored if the
.Fl -password-file
option is specified and passes the mode and owner check described above in the
option's description.
On many systems, environment variables are readable by other processes and
should be considered insecure.
Please prefer a password file instead.

.\" .Sh FILES
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, 1 if an error occurs, or 2 if the remote
protocol version is older than the local protocol version.
.Sh EXAMPLES
A common invocation of
.Nm
is for archiving from a remote host to the local computer:
.Pp
.Dl % openrsync -av --delete remote:rpath /local/path
.Pp
This will update the contents of
.Pa /local/path/rpath
with those on the remote server.
Switching remote and local wil update the remote contents instead:
.Pp
.Dl % openrsync -av --delete /local/path remote:rpath
.Pp
All examples use
.Fl t
so that destination files inherit the source time.
If not changed, subsequent invocations of
.Nm
will then consider the file up to date and not transfer block hashes.
.Pp
To update the out-of-date remote files
.Pa host:dest/bar
and
.Pa host:dest/baz
with the local
.Pa ../src/bar
and
.Pa ../src/baz :
.Pp
.Dl % openrsync -t ../src/bar ../src/baz host:dest
.Pp
To update the out-of-date local files
.Pa bar
and
.Pa baz
with the remote files
.Pa host:src/bar
and
.Pa host:src/baz :
.Pp
.Dl % openrsync -t host:src/bar :src/baz \&.
.Pp
To update the out-of-date local files
.Pa ../dest/bar
and
.Pa ../dest/baz
with
.Pa bar
and
.Pa baz :
.Pp
.Dl % openrsync -t bar baz ../dest
.Pp
To update the out-of-date remote files in
.Pa host:dest
on a remote host running
.Nm
with the local host running
.Xr rsync 1 :
.Pp
.Dl % rsync --rsync-path openrsync -t ../dest/* host:dest
