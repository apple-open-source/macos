.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
rsync is a program that behaves in much the same way that rcp does,
but has many more options and uses the rsync remote-update protocol to
greatly speedup file transfers when the destination file already
exists\&.
.PP 
The rsync remote-update protocol allows rsync to transfer just the
differences between two sets of files across the network link, using
an efficient checksum-search algorithm described in the technical
report that accompanies this package\&.
.PP 
Some of the additional features of rsync are:
.PP 
.IP o 
support for copying links, devices, owners, groups and permissions
.IP o 
exclude and exclude-from options similar to GNU tar
.IP o 
a CVS exclude mode for ignoring the same files that CVS would ignore
.IP o 
can use any transparent remote shell, including rsh or ssh
.IP o 
does not require root privileges
.IP o 
pipelining of file transfers to minimize latency costs
.IP o 
support for anonymous or authenticated rsync servers (ideal for
mirroring)
.PP 
.SH "GENERAL" 
.PP 
There are six different ways of using rsync\&. They are:
.PP 
.IP o 
for copying local files\&. This is invoked when neither
source nor destination path contains a : separator
.IP 
.IP o 
for copying from the local machine to a remote machine using
a remote shell program as the transport (such as rsh or
ssh)\&. This is invoked when the destination path contains a
single : separator\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
for copying from a remote machine to the local machine
using a remote shell program\&. This is invoked when the source
contains a : separator\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
for copying from a remote rsync server to the local
machine\&. This is invoked when the source path contains a ::
separator or a rsync:// URL\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
for copying from the local machine to a remote rsync
server\&. This is invoked when the destination path contains a ::
separator\&. 
.IP 
.IP o 
for listing files on a remote machine\&. This is done the
same way as rsync transfers except that you leave off the
local destination\&.  
.PP 
Note that in all cases (other than listing) at least one of the source
and destination paths must be local\&.
.PP 
.SH "SETUP" 
.PP 
See the file README for installation instructions\&.
.PP 
Once installed you can use rsync to any machine that you can use rsh
to\&.  rsync uses rsh for its communications, unless both the source and
destination are local\&.
.PP 
You can also specify an alternative to rsh, by either using the -e
command line option, or by setting the RSYNC_RSH environment variable\&.
.PP 
One common substitute is to use ssh, which offers a high degree of
security\&.
.PP 
Note that rsync must be installed on both the source and destination
machines\&. 
.PP 
.SH "USAGE" 
.PP 
You use rsync in the same way you use rcp\&. You must specify a source
and a destination, one of which may be remote\&.
.PP 
Perhaps the best way to explain the syntax is some examples:
.PP 
.RS 
rsync *\&.c foo:src/
.RE 
.PP 
this would transfer all files matching the pattern *\&.c from the
current directory to the directory src on the machine foo\&. If any of
the files already exist on the remote system then the rsync
remote-update protocol is used to update the file by sending only the
differences\&. See the tech report for details\&.
.PP 
.RS 
rsync -avz foo:src/bar /data/tmp
.RE 
.PP 
this would recursively transfer all files from the directory src/bar on the
machine foo into the /data/tmp/bar directory on the local machine\&. The
files are transferred in "archive" mode, which ensures that symbolic
links, devices, attributes, permissions, ownerships etc are preserved
in the transfer\&.  Additionally, compression will be used to reduce the
size of data portions of the transfer\&.
.PP 
.RS 
rsync -avz foo:src/bar/ /data/tmp
.RE 
.PP 
a trailing slash on the source changes this behavior to transfer
all files from the directory src/bar on the machine foo into the
/data/tmp/\&.  A trailing / on a source name means "copy the
contents of this directory"\&.  Without a trailing slash it means "copy
the directory"\&. This difference becomes particularly important when
using the --delete option\&.
.PP 
You can also use rsync in local-only mode, where both the source and
destination don\'t have a \':\' in the name\&. In this case it behaves like
an improved copy command\&.
.PP 
.RS 
rsync somehost\&.mydomain\&.com::
.RE 
.PP 
this would list all the anonymous rsync modules available on the host
somehost\&.mydomain\&.com\&.  (See the following section for more details\&.)
.PP 
.SH "CONNECTING TO AN RSYNC SERVER" 
.PP 
It is also possible to use rsync without using rsh or ssh as the
transport\&. In this case you will connect to a remote rsync server
running on TCP port 873\&. 
.PP 
Using rsync in this way is the same as using it with rsh or ssh except
that:
.PP 
.IP o 
you use a double colon :: instead of a single colon to
separate the hostname from the path\&. 
.IP 
.IP o 
the remote server may print a message of the day when you
connect\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
if you specify no path name on the remote server then the
list of accessible paths on the server will be shown\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
if you specify no local destination then a listing of the
specified files on the remote server is provided\&.
.PP 
Some paths on the remote server may require authentication\&. If so then
you will receive a password prompt when you connect\&. You can avoid the
password prompt by setting the environment variable RSYNC_PASSWORD to
the password you want to use or using the --password-file option\&. This
may be useful when scripting rsync\&.
.PP 
WARNING: On some systems environment variables are visible to all
users\&. On those systems using --password-file is recommended\&.
.PP 
.SH "RUNNING AN RSYNC SERVER" 
.PP 
An rsync server is configured using a config file which by default is
called /etc/rsyncd\&.conf\&. Please see the rsyncd\&.conf(5) man page for more
information\&. 
.PP 
.SH "EXAMPLES" 
.PP 
Here are some examples of how I use rsync\&.
.PP 
To backup my wife\'s home directory, which consists of large MS Word
files and mail folders, I use a cron job that runs
.PP 
.RS 
rsync -Cavz \&. arvidsjaur:backup
.RE 
.PP 
each night over a PPP link to a duplicate directory on my machine
"arvidsjaur"\&.
.PP 
To synchronize my samba source trees I use the following Makefile
targets:
.PP 
.RS 
get:
.br 
rsync -avuzb --exclude \'*~\' samba:samba/ \&.
.PP 
put:
.br 
rsync -Cavuzb \&. samba:samba/
.PP 
sync: get put
.RE 
.PP 
this allows me to sync with a CVS directory at the other end of the
link\&. I then do cvs operations on the remote machine, which saves a
lot of time as the remote cvs protocol isn\'t very efficient\&.
.PP 
I mirror a directory between my "old" and "new" ftp sites with the
command
.PP 
.RS 
rsync -az -e ssh --delete ~ftp/pub/samba/ nimbus:"~ftp/pub/tridge/samba"
.RE 
.PP 
this is launched from cron every few hours\&.
.PP

.PP 
.SH "OPTIONS" 
.PP 
rsync uses the GNU long options package\&. Many of the command line
options have two variants, one short and one long\&.  These are shown
below, separated by commas\&. Some options only have a long variant\&.
The \'=\' for options that take a parameter is optional; whitespace
can be used instead\&.
.PP 
.IP "\fB-h, --help\fP" 
Print a short help page describing the options
available in rsync
.IP 
.IP "\fB--version\fP" 
print the rsync version number and exit
.IP 
.IP "\fB-v, --verbose\fP" 
This option increases the amount of information you
are given during the transfer\&.  By default, rsync works silently\&. A
single -v will give you information about what files are being
transferred and a brief summary at the end\&. Two -v flags will give you
information on what files are being skipped and slightly more
information at the end\&. More than two -v flags should only be used if
you are debugging rsync\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-q, --quiet\fP" 
This option decreases the amount of information you
are given during the transfer, notably suppressing information messages
from the remote server\&. This flag is useful when invoking rsync from
cron\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-I, --ignore-times\fP" 
Normally rsync will skip any files that are
already the same length and have the same time-stamp\&. This option turns
off this behavior\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-I, --size-only\fP" 
Normally rsync will skip any files that are
already the same length and have the same time-stamp\&. With the
--size-only option files will be skipped if they have the same size,
regardless of timestamp\&. This is useful when starting to use rsync
after using another mirroring system which may not preserve timestamps
exactly\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-c, --checksum\fP" 
This forces the sender to checksum all files using
a 128-bit MD4 checksum before transfer\&. The checksum is then
explicitly checked on the receiver and any files of the same name
which already exist and have the same checksum and size on the
receiver are skipped\&.  This option can be quite slow\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-a, --archive\fP" 
This is equivalent to -rlptg\&. It is a quick way
of saying you want recursion and want to preserve everything\&.
.IP 
Note: if the user launching rsync is root then the -o (preserve
uid) and -D (preserve devices) options are also implied\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-r, --recursive\fP" 
This tells rsync to copy directories
recursively\&. If you don\'t specify this then rsync won\'t copy
directories at all\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-R, --relative\fP" 
Use relative paths\&. This means that the full path
names specified on the command line are sent to the server rather than
just the last parts of the filenames\&. This is particularly useful when
you want to send several different directories at the same time\&. For
example, if you used the command
.IP 

.DS 
 
rsync foo/bar/foo\&.c remote:/tmp/
.DE 
 

.IP 
then this would create a file called foo\&.c in /tmp/ on the remote
machine\&. If instead you used
.IP 

.DS 
 
rsync -R foo/bar/foo\&.c remote:/tmp/
.DE 
 

.IP 
then a file called /tmp/foo/bar/foo\&.c would be created on the remote
machine\&. The full path name is preserved\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-b, --backup\fP" 
With this option preexisting destination files are
renamed with a ~ extension as each file is transferred\&.  You can
control the backup suffix using the --suffix option\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB--suffix=SUFFIX\fP" 
This option allows you to override the default
backup suffix used with the -b option\&. The default is a ~\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-u, --update\fP" 
This forces rsync to skip any files for which the
destination file already exists and has a date later than the source
file\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-l, --links\fP" 
This tells rsync to recreate symbolic links on the
remote system  to  be the same as the local system\&. Without this
option, all symbolic links are skipped\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-L, --copy-links\fP" 
This tells rsync to treat symbolic links just
like ordinary files\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB--copy-unsafe-links\fP" 
This tells rsync to treat symbolic links that
point outside the source tree like ordinary files\&.  Absolute symlinks are
also treated like ordinary files, and so are any symlinks in the source
path itself when --relative is used\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB--safe-links\fP" 
This tells rsync to ignore any symbolic links
which point outside the destination tree\&. All absolute symlinks are
also ignored\&. Using this option in conjunction with --relative may
give unexpected results\&. 
.IP 
.IP "\fB-H, --hard-links\fP" 
This tells rsync to recreate hard  links  on
the  remote system  to  be the same as the local system\&. Without this
option hard links are treated like regular files\&.
.IP 
Note that rsync can only detect hard links if both parts of the link
are in the list of files being sent\&.
.IP 
This option can be quite slow, so only use it if you need it\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-W, --whole-file\fP" 
With this option the incremental rsync algorithm
is  not used  and  the whole file is sent as-is instead\&. This may be
useful when using rsync with a local machine\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB--partial\fP" 
By default, rsync will delete any partially
transferred file if the transfer is interrupted\&. In some circumstances
it is more desirable to keep partially transferred files\&. Using the
--partial option tells rsync to keep the partial file which should
make a subsequent transfer of the rest of the file much faster\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-p, --perms\fP" 
This option causes rsync to update the remote
permissions to be the same as the local permissions\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-o, --owner\fP" 
This option causes rsync to update the  remote  owner
of the  file to be the same as the local owner\&. This is only available
to the super-user\&.  Note that if the source system is a daemon using chroot,
the --numeric-ids option is implied because the source system cannot get
access to the usernames\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-g, --group\fP" 
This option causes rsync to update the  remote  group
of the file to be the same as the local group\&.  If the receving system is
not running as the super-user, only groups that the receiver is a member of
will be preserved (by group name, not group id number)\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-D, --devices\fP" 
This option causes rsync to transfer character and
block device information to the remote system to recreate these
devices\&. This option is only available to the super-user\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-t, --times\fP" 
This tells rsync to transfer modification times along
with the files and update them on the remote system\&.  Note that if this
option is not used, the optimization that excludes files that have not been
modified cannot be effective; in other words, a missing -t or -a will
cause the next transfer to behave as if it used -I, and all files will have
their checksums compared and show up in log messages even if they haven\'t
changed\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-n, --dry-run\fP" 
This tells rsync to not do any file transfers,
instead it will just report the actions it would have taken\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-S, --sparse\fP" 
Try to handle sparse files efficiently so they take
up less space on the destination\&.
.IP 
NOTE: Don\'t use this option when the destination is a Solaris "tmpfs"
filesystem\&. It doesn\'t seem to handle seeks over null regions
correctly and ends up corrupting the files\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-x, --one-file-system\fP" 
This tells rsync not to cross filesystem
boundaries  when recursing\&.  This  is useful for transferring the
contents of only one filesystem\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB--delete\fP" 
This tells rsync to delete any files on the receiving
side that aren\'t on the sending side\&.   Files that are excluded from
transfer are excluded from being deleted unless you use --delete-excluded\&.
.IP 
This option has no effect if directory recursion is not selected\&.
.IP 
This option can be dangerous if used incorrectly!  It is a very good idea
to run first using the dry run option (-n) to see what files would be
deleted to make sure important files aren\'t listed\&.
.IP 
rsync 1\&.6\&.4 changed the behavior of --delete to make it less
dangerous\&.  rsync now only scans directories on the receiving side
that are explicitly transferred from the sending side\&.  Only files in
these directories are deleted\&.
.IP 
Still, it is probably easy to get burnt with this option\&.  The moral
of the story is to use the -n option until you get used to the
behavior of --delete\&.
.IP 
If the sending side detects any IO errors then the deletion of any
files at the destination will be automatically disabled\&. This is to
prevent temporary filesystem failures (such as NFS errors) on the
sending side causing a massive deletion of files on the
destination\&. 
.IP 
.IP "\fB--delete-excluded\fP" 
In addition to deleting the files on the
receiving side that are not on the sending side, this tells rsync to also
delete any files on the receiving side that are excluded (see --exclude)\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB--force\fP" 
This options tells rsync to delete directories even if
they are not empty\&.  This applies to both the --delete option and to
cases where rsync tries to copy a normal file but the destination
contains a directory of the same name\&. 
.IP 
Since this option was added, deletions were reordered to be done depth-first
so it is hardly ever needed anymore except in very obscure cases\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-B , --block_size=BLOCKSIZE\fP" 
This controls the block size used in
the rsync algorithm\&. See the technical report for details\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-e, --rsh=COMMAND\fP" 
This option allows you to choose an alternative
remote shell program to use for communication between the local and
remote copies of rsync\&. By default, rsync will use rsh, but you may
like to instead use ssh because of its high security\&.
.IP 
You can also choose the remote shell program using the RSYNC_RSH
environment variable\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB--rsync-path=PATH\fP" 
Use this to specify the path to the copy of
rsync on the remote machine\&. Useful when it\'s not in your path\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB--exclude=PATTERN\fP" 
This option allows you to selectively exclude
certain files from the list of files to be transferred\&. This is most
useful in combination with a recursive transfer\&.
.IP 
You may use as many --exclude options on the command line as you like
to build up the list of files to exclude\&.
.IP 
See the section on exclude patterns for information on the syntax of 
this option\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB--exclude-from=FILE\fP" 
This option is similar to the --exclude
option, but instead it adds all filenames listed in the file FILE to
the exclude list\&.  Blank lines in FILE and lines starting with \';\' or \'#\'
are ignored\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB--include=PATTERN\fP" 
This option tells rsync to not exclude the
specified pattern of filenames\&. This is useful as it allows you to
build up quite complex exclude/include rules\&.
.IP 
See the section of exclude patterns for information on the syntax of 
this option\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB--include-from=FILE\fP" 
This specifies a list of include patterns
from a file\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-C, --cvs-exclude\fP" 
This is a useful shorthand for excluding a
broad range of files that you often don\'t want to transfer between
systems\&. It uses the same algorithm that CVS uses to determine if
a file should be ignored\&.
.IP 
The exclude list is initialized to:
.IP 
.RS 
RCS SCCS CVS CVS\&.adm RCSLOG cvslog\&.* tags TAGS \&.make\&.state
\&.nse_depinfo *~ #* \&.#* ,* *\&.old *\&.bak *\&.BAK *\&.orig *\&.rej \&.del-*
*\&.a *\&.o *\&.obj *\&.so *\&.Z *\&.elc *\&.ln core
.RE 
.IP 
then files listed in a $HOME/\&.cvsignore are added to the list and any
files listed in the CVSIGNORE environment variable (space delimited)\&.
.IP 
Finally in each directory any files listed in the \&.cvsignore file in
that directory are added to the list\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB--csum-length=LENGTH\fP" 
By default the primary checksum used in
rsync is a very strong 16 byte MD4 checksum\&. In most cases you will
find that a truncated version of this checksum is quite efficient, and
this will decrease the size of the checksum data sent over the link,
making things faster\&. 
.IP 
You can choose the number of bytes in the truncated checksum using the
--csum-length option\&. Any value less than or equal to 16 is valid\&.
.IP 
Note that if you use this option then you run the risk of ending up
with an incorrect target file\&. The risk with a value of 16 is
microscopic and can be safely ignored (the universe will probably end
before it fails) but with smaller values the risk is higher\&.
.IP 
Current versions of rsync actually use an adaptive algorithm for the
checksum length by default, using a 16 byte file checksum to determine
if a 2nd pass is required with a longer block checksum\&. Only use this
option if you have read the source code and know what you are doing\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-T, --temp-dir=DIR\fP" 
This option instructs rsync to use DIR as a
scratch directory when creating temporary copies of the files
transferred on the receiving side\&.  The default behavior is to create
the temporary files in the receiving directory\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB--compare-dest=DIR\fP" 
This option instructs rsync to use DIR as an
additional directory to compare destination files against when doing
transfers\&.  This is useful for doing transfers to a new destination while
leaving existing files intact, and then doing a flash-cutover when all
files have been successfully transferred (for example by moving directories
around and removing the old directory, although this requires also doing
the transfer with -I to avoid skipping files that haven\'t changed)\&.  This
option increases the usefulness of --partial because partially transferred
files will remain in the new temporary destination until they have a chance
to be completed\&.  If DIR is a relative path, it is relative to the
destination directory\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB-z, --compress\fP" 
With this option, rsync compresses any data from
the source file(s) which it sends to the destination machine\&.  This
option is useful on slow links\&.  The compression method used is the
same method that gzip uses\&.
.IP 
Note this this option typically achieves better compression ratios
that can be achieved by using a compressing remote shell, or a
compressing transport, as it takes advantage of the implicit
information sent for matching data blocks\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB--numeric-ids\fP" 
With this option rsync will transfer numeric group
and user ids rather than using user and group names and mapping them
at both ends\&.
.IP 
By default rsync will use the user name and group name to determine
what ownership to give files\&. The special uid 0 and the special group
0 are never mapped via user/group names even if the --numeric-ids
option is not specified\&.
.IP 
If the source system is a daemon using chroot, or if a user or group name
does not exist on the destination system, then the numeric id from the
source system is used instead\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB--timeout=TIMEOUT\fP" 
This option allows you to set a maximum IO
timeout in seconds\&. If no data is transferred for the specified time
then rsync will exit\&. The default is 0, which means no timeout\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB--daemon\fP" 
This tells rsync that it is to run as a rsync
daemon\&. If standard input is a socket then rsync will assume that it
is being run via inetd, otherwise it will detach from the current
terminal and become a background daemon\&. The daemon will read the
config file (/etc/rsyncd\&.conf) on each connect made by a client and
respond to requests accordingly\&. See the rsyncd\&.conf(5) man page for more
details\&. 
.IP 
.IP "\fB--config=FILE\fP" 
This specifies an alternate config file than
the default /etc/rsyncd\&.conf\&. This is only relevant when --daemon is
specified\&. 
.IP 
.IP "\fB--port=PORT\fP" 
This specifies an alternate TCP port number to use
rather than the default port 873\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB--log-format=FORMAT\fP" 
This allows you to specify exactly what the
rsync client logs to stdout on a per-file basis\&. The log format is
specified using the same format conventions as the log format option in
rsyncd\&.conf\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB--stats\fP" 
This tells rsync to print a verbose set of statistics
on the file transfer, allowing you to tell how effective the rsync
algorithm is for your data\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB--progress\fP" 
This option tells rsync to print information
showing the progress of the transfer\&. This gives a bored user
something to watch\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fB--password-file\fP" 
This option allows you to provide a password
in a file for accessing a remote rsync server\&. Note that this option
is only useful when accessing a rsync server using the built in
transport, not when using a remote shell as the transport\&. The file
must not be world readable\&.
.IP 
.PP 
.SH "EXCLUDE PATTERNS" 
.PP 
The exclude and include patterns specified to rsync allow for flexible
selection of which files to transfer and which files to skip\&.
.PP 
rsync builds a ordered list of include/exclude options as specified on
the command line\&. When a filename is encountered, rsync checks the
name against each exclude/include pattern in turn\&. The first matching
pattern is acted on\&. If it is an exclude pattern than that file is
skipped\&. If it is an include pattern then that filename is not
skipped\&. If no matching include/exclude pattern is found then the
filename is not skipped\&.
.PP 
The patterns can take several forms\&. The rules are:
.PP 
.IP o 
if the pattern starts with a / then it is matched against the
start of the filename, otherwise it is matched against the end of
the filename\&. Thus /foo would match a file called foo
at the base of the tree whereas foo would match any file
called foo anywhere in the tree\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
if the pattern ends with a / then it will only match a
directory, not a file, link or device\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
if the pattern contains a wildcard character from the set
*?[ then expression matching is applied using the shell filename
matching rules\&. Otherwise a simple string match is used\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
if the pattern contains a / (not counting a trailing /) then it
is matched against the full filename, including any leading
directory\&. If the pattern doesn\'t contain a / then it is matched
only against the final component of the filename\&.  Furthermore, if
the pattern includes a double asterisk "**" then all wildcards in
the pattern will match slashes, otherwise they will stop at slashes\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
if the pattern starts with "+ " (a plus followed by a space)
then it is always considered an include pattern, even if specified as
part of an exclude option\&. The "+ " part is discarded before matching\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
if the pattern starts with "- " (a minus followed by a space)
then it is always considered an exclude pattern, even if specified as
part of an include option\&. The "- " part is discarded before matching\&.
.IP 
.IP o 
if the pattern is a single exclamation mark ! then the current
exclude list is reset, removing all previous exclude patterns\&.
.PP 
The +/- rules are most useful in exclude lists, allowing you to have a
single exclude list that contains both include and exclude options\&.
.PP 
Here are some examples:
.PP 
.IP o 
--exclude "*\&.o" would exclude all filenames matching *\&.o
.IP o 
--exclude "/foo" would exclude a file in the base directory called foo
.IP o 
--exclude "foo/" would exclude any directory called foo
.IP o 
--exclude "/foo/*/bar" would exclude any file called bar two
levels below a base directory called foo
.IP o 
--exclude "/foo/**/bar" would exclude any file called bar two
or more levels below a base directory called foo
.IP o 
--include "*/" --include "*\&.c" --exclude "*" would include all 
directories and C source files
.IP o 
--include "foo/" --include "foo/bar\&.c" --exclude "*" would include
only foo/bar\&.c (the foo/ directory must be explicitly included or
it would be excluded by the "*")
.PP 
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS" 
.PP 
rsync occasionally produces error messages that may seem a little
cryptic\&. The one that seems to cause the most confusion is "protocol
version mismatch - is your shell clean?"\&.
.PP 
This message is usually caused by your startup scripts or remote shell
facility producing unwanted garbage on the stream that rsync is using
for its transport\&. The way to diagnose this problem is to run your
remote shell like this:
.PP 

.DS 
 

   rsh remotehost /bin/true > out\&.dat

.DE 
 

.PP 
then look at out\&.dat\&. If everything is working correctly then out\&.dat
should be a zero length file\&. If you are getting the above error from
rsync then you will probably find that out\&.dat contains some text or
data\&. Look at the contents and try to work out what is producing
it\&. The most common cause is incorrectly configured shell startup
scripts (such as \&.cshrc or \&.profile) that contain output statements
for non-interactive logins\&.
.PP 
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES" 
.PP 
.IP 
.IP "\fBCVSIGNORE\fP" 
The CVSIGNORE environment variable supplements any
ignore patterns in \&.cvsignore files\&. See the --cvs-exclude option for
more details\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBRSYNC_RSH\fP" 
The RSYNC_RSH environment variable allows you to
override the default shell used as the transport for rsync\&. This can
be used instead of the -e option\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBRSYNC_PASSWORD\fP" 
Setting RSYNC_PASSWORD to the required
password allows you to run authenticated rsync connections to a rsync
daemon without user intervention\&. Note that this does not supply a
password to a shell transport such as ssh\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBUSER\fP or \fBLOGNAME\fP" 
The USER or LOGNAME environment variables
are used to determine the default username sent to a rsync server\&.
.IP 
.IP "\fBHOME\fP" 
The HOME environment variable is used to find the user\'s
default \&.cvsignore file\&.
