functionality or code incorporated in Subject Software) infringes the
third party's intellectual property rights, Recipient must place in a
well-identified web page bearing the title "LEGAL" a description of each
such claim and a description of the party making each such claim in
sufficient detail that a user of the Subject Software will know whom to
contact regarding the claim. Also, upon gaining such knowledge of any
such claim, Recipient must conspicuously include the URL for such web
page in the Exhibit A notice required under Sections 2 and 3, above, and
in the text of any related documentation, license agreement or
collateral in which Recipient describes end user's rights relating to
