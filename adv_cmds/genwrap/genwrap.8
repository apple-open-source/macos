.Dt GENWRAP 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm genwrap
.Nd generate parameterized program wrappers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl n Ar name
.Op Fl o Ar output
.Ar spec
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility generates program wrappers, hereby referred to as
.Dq shims ,
from a specification.
.Nm
is primarily intended to be used for the following scenarios:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
Adding a shim that reports analytics on program usage.
.It
Adding a shim that allows switching between multiple application implementations
based on an environment variable.
.It
Adding a shim that may switch between multiple application implementations
based on the arguments being used.
.El
.Pp
.Ar spec
should be a file written in the format specified later in
.Sx SPECIFICATION FORMAT .
.Pp
The following options are available for
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -offset indent
.It Fl d
Enables debug output to stderr.
In particular, this emits notice of each action taken as a result of the
specified wrapper definition as it is parsed, without any filtering.
This is mainly intended to aide in debugging
.Nm
itself.
.It Fl n Ar name
Use
.Ar name
for the generated wrapper's name.
This will be used as the name within
.Pa /var/select
to check for a defined system choice.
The
.Ar name
will be automatically derived from a filename by omitting a trailing
.Dq .wrapper ,
so it is not necessary to specify for cases where the wrapper
.Pa foo.wrapper
should use
.Pa /var/select/foo .
.It Fl o Ar output
Switch the output file to
.Ar output .
The default is to write the shim to stdout, and stdout may also be specified
by explicitly passing
.Dq -
for
.Ar output .
.El
.Pp
Note that
.Nm
only generates a C source file for the shim.
.Nm
does not directly offer the ability to build a binary from the shim.
.Pp
The
.Nm
generated wrapper will use the following logic to choose the application to
execute, in this order of precedence:
.Pp
If an
.Va env
var is configured, the variable is set in the environment, then it will be used.
.Pp
If argument-based switching is used, then the default application is checked
first for compatibility with the arguments presented.
The default application is discussed below in the
.Sx SPECIFICATION FORMAT
section.
The applications are checked in the defined order after the default application
is checked.
.Pp
If the above criteria did not result in anything to execute, then the default
application will be executed.
.Ss SPECIFICATION FORMAT
.Nm
uses a minimal custom language for generating shims.
This language is best described as two primary functional blocks, the
shim setting block and the application specification block.
The shim setting block
.Em must
appear before application specifications.
Comments begin with a
.Dq # ,
and whitespace is generally irrelevant outside of quoted values.
By convention, one line corresponds to exactly one directive.
.Pp
Listings in the rest of this section may be interpreted and written literally
into a specification file.
If a keyword appears in
.Oo brackets Oc ,
then the keyword is optional and the brackets should be omitted when writing the
keyword.
.Pp
The following optional directives may be specified in the shim setting block:
.Bl -tag -offset indent
.It analytics Dq Ar identifier
Report CoreAnalytics events with the specified
.Ar identifier .
CoreAnalytics is disabled if this directive is not in use.
.It env Dq Ar variable
Use the specified
.Ar variable
to switch specified application implementations based on the environment that
the generated shim is run in.
Values for the environment variable match the names specified later in the
application specification block.
.El
.Pp
Applications are defined after the shim setting block.
At least one application must be defined.
Every application must have a
.Cm path
set.
.Pp
All directives besides the
.Cm application
directives apply to the last specified
.Cm application
prior to the directive.
By convention, all directives besides the
.Cm application
directives are indented by some consistent amount of whitespace to improve
readability of the specification.
.Pp
The following directives may be specified in the application specification
block:
.Bl -tag -offset indent
.It application Dq Ar name
Defines an application with the specified
.Ar name .
The given
.Ar name
name typically corresponds to the name of the binary that this application block
will represent, but its exact value is not significant.
If the
.Cm env
directive is specified above, then the specified environment variable may be set
to
.Ar name
to indicate that this application block's path should be used.
.It default
Optionally specifies that this application block is the default application.
If no
.Cm default
directive is specified, then the resulting shim will use the first specified
application as the default.
If a
.Pa /var/select
symlink is specified for the given wrapper, then the named application will be
considered the default instead.
.It argmode logonly
Indicates that any flag directives specified should only be considered for
logging purposes.
If arguments are evaluated to determine which application to choose, one with
.Ar logonly
set will be considered acceptable by default.
.It path Dq Ar path
This directive is
.Cm required
for each specified
.Cm application .
The given
.Ar path
should be the path to the binary to be used if this application is selected.
.Pp
If a relative path is given, then it will be prefixed with the active developer
directory as provided by
.Xr xcode-select 1
at runtime, with one exception.
If the relative path begins with a literal
.Dq $XCODE/
component, then
.Nm
will instead invoke
.Xr xcrun 1
with the trailing part of the relative path as the tool name.
For example,
.Dq $XCODE/yacc
will do the equivalent behavior of:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
xcrun yacc ...
.Ed
.Pp
If an absolute path is given, then it will be used as-is.
.It addarg Do Ar argv[1] Dc Oo Do argv[n] Dc ... Oc
Adds the given quoted words to the arguments we pass to this application, if
selected.
These arguments are inserted at argv[1], before any arguments that the wrapper
was invoked with.
.It flag Do Ar flag Dc Oo optional_arg | arg Oc Oo logonly Oc Op pattern \
Dq pattern
Adds the given
.Ar flag
as a recognized flag by this application.
If
.Ar flag
is a long flag, it must not have a short flag alias when used in this form.
.Pp
If
.Cm optional_arg
or
.Cm arg
are specified, then it is noted in the shim that this flag takes an argument.
.Pp
If
.Cm logonly
is specified, then this argument will not be considered an acceptable argument
for the application in argument-based switching.
.Pp
Specifying a
.Cm pattern
enables collection of option arguments if and only if they match the described
pattern.
The
.Ar pattern
will be interpreted and executed as a POSIX extended regular expression, as
described in
.Xr re_format 7 .
.It flag Do Ar longflag Dc Do Ar shortflag Dc Oo optional_arg | arg Oc \
Oo logonly Oc Op pattern Dq pattern
This is equivalent to the above form, except that
.Ar longflag
explicitly has a
.Ar shortflag
alias.
.El
.Pp
The
.Cm flag
directives are only necessary if argument-based switching is desired, rather
than environment-based switching.
Informing the shim of argument structure may also be used to limit reported
analytics to avoid inadvertently including arguments.
See
.Sx ANALYTICS
for more details.
.Ss ANALYTICS
.Nm
may be used to generate shims that collect analytics on application usage.
The details reported can be useful in understanding how applications are used
in practice to inform relevant decisions.
.Pp
When analytics are enabled,
.Nm
shims report events with the following details:
.Bl -tag -offset indent
.It Sy name
The name the wrapper was invoked as, i.e., argv[0].
.It Sy chosen
The name, provided in the
.Cm application
directive, of the specific application that was chosen to be invoked.
.It Sy arguments
The array of arguments passed to the wrapper.
.El
.Pp
Note that, currently, all arguments passed to the wrapper are reported in these
events.
The specification grammar accepts a
.Cm noargs
keyword after the
.Cm analytics
, which may be used to omit flags' argument values as well as any
non-option arguments to prevent an inadvertent information disclosure through,
e.g., file names.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Pa /usr/local/share/genwrap/wrapper-head.c
The prologue for the shim that
.Nm
will write out, containing some include files and definitions that will later
be used in the implementation.
.It Pa /usr/local/share/genwrap/wrapper-tail.c
The implementation of the shim that is written out at the end of the file.
.It Pa /usr/local/share/genwrap/examples
Directory containing examples that are ready for
.Nm
to be run against for demonstration.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Define a shim that may switch between
.Xr make 1
implementations based on the
.Ev COMMAND_MAKE
environment variable:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
env "COMMAND_MAKE"
# Arbitrarily specified in alphabetical order.
application "bmake"
	# A minimal application specification only consists of a path.
	path "usr/bin/bmake"
application "gnumake"
	default
	# Note that both of these will be invoked out of developer tools,
	# because they're relative paths.
	path "usr/bin/gnumake"
# usr/bin/bmake will be selected if the resulting shim is compiled and run in
# an environment with COMMAND_MAKE="bmake", and usr/bin/gmake will be selected
# if the resulting shim is run in an environment with COMMAND_MAKE="gnumake".
.Ed
.Pp
Define a shim that may switch to another application if non-described flags are
specified.
The default application will be checked first, followed by every other defined
application in the order that they're defined.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Collect analytics on this one primarily because we want to see how often
# our shim ends up selecting the oldapp, along with what arguments are most
# commonly being used when the shim is forced to switch to oldapp.
analytics "com.example.newapp"
env "COMMAND_APP"
# If newapp is forced by setting COMMAND_APP=newapp in the environment when the
# shim is ran, then we will simply execute it without checking any flags.  This
# can be useful if support for a flag is added to /usr/bin/newapp but it is
# being tested before recognizing it as valid in the shim.
application "newapp"
	path "/usr/bin/newapp"
	# Supports -b, --bytes; that flag takes an argument.
	flag "bytes" "b" arg
	# Supports a --verbose flag that takes no argument.
	flag "verbose"
	# Transform the wrapper being called as `app ...` into `newapp -g ...`
	addarg "-g"
application "oldapp"
	path "/usr/bin/oldapp"
	# No flags directives here indicates that we do not need to check the
	# specified flags to try and use this application, so if a flag that
	# newapp does not support is specified then we will immediately fallback
	# to oldapp.

.Dq \&?
is a valid flag.
