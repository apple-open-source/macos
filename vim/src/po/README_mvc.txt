TRANSLATING VIM MESSAGES

This file explains how to create and maintain po files using a number of
GnuWin packages.  You will need gettext, libiconv and libexpat.  As of
January 2024 the versions known to work are gettext 0.14.4, libiconv 1.9.2-1
and expat 2.5.0.  Gettext and libiconv can be found at:

	http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/

expat can be found at:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/
or
	https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat

expat will install into its own directory.  You should copy libexpat.dll into
the bin directory created from the gettext/libiconv packages.
Or Michele Locati kindly provides precompiled binaries gettext 0.21 and
iconv 1.16 for Windows on his site: 

	https://mlocati.github.io/articles/gettext-iconv-windows.html

First read the README.txt file in this directory for general remarks on
translating Vim messages.


SETUP

Set the environment variable LANGUAGE to the language code for the language
you are translating Vim messages to.  Language codes are typically two
characters and you can find a list of them at:

	https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php
	https://www.science.co.il/language/Codes.php
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes

Another possibility is to use the GnuWin32 port of gettext.  This is
recommended especially if you use already GnuWin32 tools to gunzip, bunzip,
patch etc. these files.  You find the GnuWin32 version of gettext here:

        http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gettext.htm

Yet another very strait forward way is to get the sources of gettext from

        http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html

and build your own version of these tools.  The documentation states that this
should be possible with MSVC4.0, MSVC5.0, MSVC6.0 or MSVC7.0, but you can
build it even successfully with MSVC8.0.

The LANGUAGE environment variable can be set from the command line, by adding
a line to your autoexec.bat file, or by defining a user variable from the
Advanced tab in the System control panel.  If the LANGUAGE environment
variable has not been set in any of the above ways, the value of this variable
will be set automatically according to the language used in the OS.  This
value will be valid until the "nmake.exe" program terminates.

Next, edit Make_mvc.mak so that GETTEXT_PATH points the binary directory of
the installation.


CREATING A NEW TRANSLATION

When creating a new translation you must add your language code to the
Make_all.mak file in the lines defining LANGUAGES and MOFILES, POFILES and
CHECKFILES.  If the encoding of the translation text differs from the default
UTF-8, add a corresponding entry in MOCONVERTED, specifying the required
encoding.
To create the initial .po file for your language you must use the command:

	nmake.exe -f Make_mvc.mak first_time

Note: You need to be in the po directory when using this makefile.

Once you have your new .po file load it into Vim and source cleanup.vim, this
will convert untranslated messages to comments.  If you have syntax
highlighting turned on then untranslated messages will stand out more easily.

You will also need to edit the file names in the comments in the .po file.
You need to remove the absolute directory specification (which has the form
c:\vim91\src\).  You can do this in Vim with the following command with the
appropriate directory specification for where you have installed the Vim
source:

	%s/c:\\vim91\\src\\//g


UPDATING A TRANSLATION

If there are new or changed messages in Vim that need translating, then the
first thing to do is merge them into the existing translations.  This is done
with the following command:

	nmake.exe -f Make_mvc.mak xx

where xx is the language code for the language needing translations.  The
original .po file is copied to xx.po.orig.


DOING THE TRANSLATION

Now that you have a .po file you can do the translations for all messages that
need it.  See README.txt for specific instructions.

Once you have finished translating the messages you should make sure all
non-translated strings are commented out.  This can be done by sourcing
cleanup.vim once again.


CHECKING THE TRANSLATION

Check the translation with the following command:

	nmake.exe -f Make_mvc.mak xx.ck

Correct any errors reported.  When there are no more errors, the translation
is ready to be installed.


INSTALLING THE TRANSLATION

Install your translation with the following command:

	nmake.exe -f Make_mvc.mak install

This will create the xx\LC_MESSAGES directory in runtime\lang if it does not
already exist.
You can also use the following command to install all languages:

	nmake.exe -f Make_mvc.mak install-all


AFTER ALL OF THESE STEPS

Clean the "po" directory of all temporary and unnecessary files.  Execute the
command:

	nmake.exe -f Make_mvc.mak clean


TRANSLATION OF VIM THE EDITOR PLUG-INS

Vim supports displaying plugin messages for various native languages.
Translation is available both for plugins that are supplied as part of the Vim
editor (e.g. "optwin.vim") and for third-party plugin packages.

To translate the plugins supplied with the Vim editor, you must specify a
gettext() function call for the strings you want to translate.
The translation of these strings will be retrieved by gettext() from the MO
file "vim.mo".

For third-party plugins, it is necessary to specify a one-time call to the
bindtextdomain() function in scripts containing translation strings and for
all message strings to add a {package} argument to the gettext() function. For
more information, see ":help package-translation".
