EVIM(1)                     General Commands Manual                    EVIM(1)



NAME
       evim - easy Vim, edit a file with Vim and setup for modeless editing

SYNOPSIS
       evim [options] [file ..]
       eview

DESCRIPTION
       eVim starts Vim and sets options to make it behave like a modeless edi‚Äê
       tor.  This is still Vim but used as  a  point-and-click  editor.   This
       feels  a lot like using Notepad on MS-Windows.  eVim will always run in
       the GUI, to enable the use of menus and toolbar.

       Only to be used for people who really can't work with Vim in the normal
       way.  Editing will be much less efficient.

       eview  is  the  same, but starts in read-only mode.  It works just like
       evim -R.

       See vim(1) for details about Vim, options, etc.

       The 'insertmode' option is set to be able to type text directly.
       Mappings are setup to make Copy and  Paste  work  with  the  MS-Windows
       keys.   CTRL-X  cuts  text,  CTRL-C copies text and CTRL-V pastes text.
       Use CTRL-Q to obtain the original meaning of CTRL-V.

OPTIONS
       See vim(1).

FILES
       /usr/local/share/vim/vim??/evim.vim
                      The script loaded to initialize eVim.
                      vim??  is short version number, like vim91 for Vim 9.1

AKA
       Also Known As "Vim for gumbies".  When using evim you are  expected  to
       take  a  handkerchief,  make  a knot in each corner and wear it on your
       head.
