VIMDIFF(1)                  General Commands Manual                 VIMDIFF(1)



NAME
       vimdiff  -  edit  between two and eight versions of a file with Vim and
       show differences

SYNOPSIS
       vimdiff [options]  file1  file2  [file3  [file4  [file5  [file6  [file7
       [file8]]]]]]

       gvimdiff

DESCRIPTION
       Vimdiff  starts  Vim  on two up to eight files.  Each file gets its own
       window.  The differences between the files are highlighted.  This is  a
       nice way to inspect changes and to move changes from one version to an‐
       other version of the same file.

       See vim(1) for details about Vim itself.

       When started as gvimdiff the GUI will be started, if available.

       In each window the 'diff' option will be set, which causes the  differ‐
       ences to be highlighted.
       The 'wrap' and 'scrollbind' options are set to make the text look good.
       The  'foldmethod'  option  is set to "diff", which puts ranges of lines
       without changes in a fold.  'foldcolumn' is set to two to make it  easy
       to spot the folds and open or close them.

OPTIONS
       Vertical  splits  are  used to align the lines, as if the "-O" argument
       was used.  To use horizontal splits instead, use the "-o" argument.

       For all other arguments see vim(1).
