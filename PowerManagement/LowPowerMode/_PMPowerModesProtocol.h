 * @discussion          Submits an asynchronous request to the Modes Manager to set the Power Mode to the desired state.
 *                      The Modes Manager ensures only one Power Mode is active at a time. Setting a non-OFF PowerState for a Power Mode will result in
 *                      any other active Power Mode being turned off.
 * @param handler                Will be invoked once the request is processed by the Modes Manager to indicate the new state of the power mode.
 * @return              Reflects whether the request is well-formed and the arguments are valid. `kIOReturnSuccess` indicates that the request was
 *                      submitted to the Modes Manager. Depending on system conditions and mode availability, the Power Mode may still not be set to the
 *                      requested set. If the request is not honored, `PMPowerModeUpdateHandler` will be invoked with an error to indicate the failure to
 *                      process the request.
