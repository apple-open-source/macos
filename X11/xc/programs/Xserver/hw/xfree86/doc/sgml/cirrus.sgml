<sect> Supported chipsets <p>

There are two different SVGA drivers for Cirrus chipsets, one called
``cirrus'' and one called ``cl64xx''.
The ``cirrus'' driver is used in the 256-color SVGA server (with
acceleration) and the mono server (without acceleration). The SVGA server
supports 16, 24, and 32 bits-per-pixel truecolor modes on some configurations.
The ``cl64xx'' driver is used in the 256-color SVGA, 16-color and mono
servers.  Note that except where stated otherwise, this document is
referring to the ``cirrus'' driver.
The following chipsets by Cirrus Logic are supported:
<descrip>
<tag>CL-GD5420</tag>
	ISA SVGA chipset, 1Mbyte; maximum dot clock is 45 MHz (256
	color server). Acceleration with extended write modes (used
	for scrolling and solid filling in this driver). This chipset
	can <em>not</em> support 1024x768 non-interlaced in 256 colors.
<tag>CL-GD5422</tag>
	Enhanced version of the 5420 (32-bit internal memory
	interface). Maximum dot clock is 80 MHz.
<tag>CL-GD6205/6215/6225/6235</tag>
	Laptop chipsets more or less compatible with the 5420. The
	only dot clock supported is 25 MHz (more on an external
	display). Some problems have been reported with these
	chipsets (especially on external displays). Take note of
	the "<tt>noaccel</tt>" option.
<tag>CL-GD6420/6440</tag>
	These chipsets are not compatible with the 542x series, but are
        supported by the ``cl64xx'' driver. It is used in
        recent laptops, and bears some similarity to old Cirrus
        chipsets (5410/AVGA2). The driver may also work for other
        64xx chips. The configuration identifiers for this driver are
	"<tt>cl6420</tt>" and <tt>"cl6440"</tt>.  This driver is discussed
	in detail in section <ref id="cl64xx" name="The cl64xx Driver">.
<tag>CL-GD5424</tag>
	Basically VLB version of the 5422, but resembles the
	5426 in some respects.
<tag>CL-GD5426</tag>
	Supports both ISA bus and VLB, and up to 2Mbyte of memory.
	Has BitBLT engine for improved acceleration (BitBlt, image
	transfer, text). Dot clock limit is 85 MHz.
<tag>CL-GD5428</tag>
	Enhanced version of the 5426.
<tag>CL-GD5429</tag>
	Enhanced version of the 5428; officially supports higher
	MCLK and has memory-mapped I/O.
<tag>CL-GD5430</tag>
	Similar to 5429, but with 543x core (32-bit host interface).
	Does not have 64-bit memory mode.
<tag>CL-GD5434</tag>
	`Alpine' family chip with 64-bit internal memory interface.
        The chip
	can only support 64-bit mode if equipped with 2 Mbytes of
	memory; cards with only 1 Mbyte are severely limited.
	Supports dot clocks up to 110 MHz (later chips support
	135 MHz).
<tag>CL-GD5436</tag>
	Highly optimized 5434.
<tag>CL-GD5440</tag>
	Similar to the CL-GD5430, and detected as such.
<tag>CL-GD5446</tag>
	Another member of the Alpine family of 2D accelerators; similar
        to the CL-GD5436.
<tag>CL-GD5480</tag>
	Newer Alpine family chip that support synchronous graphics RAM
	(SGRAM).
<tag>CL-GD5462, CL-GD5464 and CL-GD5465</tag>
	The Laguna VisualMedia family of 2D  Accelerators.  These chips 
	use Rambus RDRAM memory.  The '62 is a 64-bit 2D 
	accelerator, including a BitBlit engine, video windows (not currently
	used by the server), and 64x64 HW cursor.  Mono modes have not been
	tested. The CL-GD5464 is the next chip in the Laguna family, and the
	CL-GD5465 is the latest member, both have been tested.
<tag>CL-GD7541/7542/7543/7548</tag>
	Laptop chipsets more or less compatible with the 5428/3x.
        While has it been tested on some configurations, not all
        configuration may work correctly.
<tag>CL-GD7555</tag>
	Limited untested support, without auto-detection, has been
	provided for this chip which is a 64-bit extension of the 754x
	family. Use a Chipset "clgd7555" line.

For 546x chips, the above table isn't quite accurate.  While the virtual 
width may be any size, the screen <it>pitch</it> will be rounded up to the 
nearest value in the table
below.  Thus, each line on the screen will take more video memory than just
what is displayed.  To maximize video memory, then, choose the virtual
desktop width from the table of pixel widths below:
<quote><verb>

32bpp:	160,  256,  320,  416,  512,  640,  832, 1024, 1280, 1664
</verb></quote>
 
For other Cirrus chips, it's advisable to have a virtual width that is a
multiple of 32 if acceleration is used.
The horizontal monitor timings must be below 2048.

To run <tt>XF86_SVGA</tt> at a higher color depth, pass options to the
X server as follows:
<verb>
startx -- -bpp 16		5-6-5 RGB ('64K color', XGA)
startx -- -bpp 16 -weight 555	5-5-5 RGB ('Hicolor') (not on 5462)
startx -- -bpp 24		8-8-8 RGB truecolor
startx -- -bpp 32		8-8-8 XRGB truecolor (543X/46/6X only)
</verb>


<sect> Basic configuration <p>

It is recommended that you generate an XF86Config file using
the `<tt>XF86Setup</tt>' or `<tt>xf86config</tt>' program, which should
produce a working
high-resolution 8bpp configuration. You may want to include mode
timings in the <tt>Monitor</tt> section that better fit your monitor
(e.g 1152x900 modes). The driver options are described in detail in
the next section; here the basic options are hinted at.

For all chipsets, a <tt>Clockchip "cirrus"</tt> line in the
<tt>Device</tt> section can be useful. This allows the use of any dot
clocks, instead of one out of the fixed set of dot clocks supported
by the driver. This is required if you want a 12.6 MHz dot clock for
low-resolution modes. However, when this option used, clock frequencies
be unstable leading to strange effects, so only use it if absolutely
required.

For any chip with a BitBLT engine, the new XAA (XFree86 Acceleration
Architecture) is used. This code is new and still in a beta stage.
If graphics redrawing goes wrong, try the
<tt>"noaccel"</tt> option; if it is using memory-mapped I/O,
<tt>"no_mmio"</tt> might be sufficient.

In order to be able to run at a depth of 16bpp, 24bpp, or 32bpp, and to improve
performance at 8bpp, linear addressing must be enabled. This is generally

In order to be able to run at a depth of 16bpp, 24bpp or 32bpp, and to improve
performance at 8bpp, linear addressing must be enabled. Linear addressing
is the default mode of operation on any PCI-bus configuration; use
<tt>"nolinear"</tt> to disable it.
For other bus types, it is generally
possible on 543x local bus cards, and if you have less than 16Mb of system
memory, on local bus 542x cards and ISA 543x cards. You must specify
the <tt>"linear"</tt> option and possibly a <tt>Membase</tt>
address. See the following sections for a detailed description.

Memory-mapped I/O is the default mode of operation for any Alpine family
chip. For the 5429, the <tt>"mmio"</tt> option may be used
to enable it, but it has not been tested.

Finally, if you have 546X chip, it will be on either a PCI or AGP bus.
As such, there
is no problem about memory mapped I/O or linear frame buffer address spaces
running into system memory.  The PCI spaces are mapped way up near the 4GB
point.  Because the mmio and linear frame buffer don't conflict at all on 
the system, the <tt>"linear"</tt>, <tt>Membase</tt>, and 
<tt>"mmio"</tt> options are ignored (memory mapped I/O  and linear
addressing are always used).

<sect> XF86Config options <p>
Don't use the `<tt>Clocks</tt>' command. The clocks are fixed
(i.e. not probed), and
there should be no variation between cards (other than the maximum supported
clock for each chipset).

The following options are of particular interest to the Cirrus driver. Each
of them must be specified in the `<tt>svga</tt>' driver section of the
<tt>XF86Config</tt>
file, within the <tt>Screen</tt> subsections of the depths to which they are
applicable (you can enable options for all depths by specifying them in the
Device section).
<descrip>
<tag>Option "noaccel"</tag>
	This option will disable the use of any accelerated functions. This
	is likely to help with problems related to bugs in acceleration
	functions, and perhaps high dot clocks and DRAM timing, at the cost
	of performance (which will still be reasonable on a local bus).
<tag>Option "fast_dram" "med_dram"
"slow_dram" (5424/6/8/9, 543x, 5446, 546x)
</tag>
        These options set the internal memory clock (MCLK, or BCLK for
	the 546x) register to
	another value. The default value programmed by the BIOS is
	usually OK, don't mess with these options unless absolutely
        required.

	The <tt>"fast_dram"</tt> option will cause the driver to set the
	internal
	memory clock (MCLK) register of the video card to a higher value
	(recent chips use an even higher value by default).
	Normally, this register is not touched but it appears that the
	standard CL-GD542x BIOS initializes it to a value that is somewhat
	on the low side (limited by the chip specification), which has a
	negative influence on performance of high dot clock modes. This
	is especially true if extended RAS timing is being used (this is
	indicated in the server probe).
	The actual speed of DRAM is not a critical factor in the determining
	whether	this option is appropriate; one CL-GD5426-based card with
	80ns DRAM using Extended RAS timing, which came with a DOS driver
	utility to set the MCLK to this value (0x22), seems to run stable
	at higher MCLK.

	There are also (mainly brand name) cards whose customized BIOS does
	initialize to a higher non-standard value.

	The <tt>"slow_dram"</tt>
	option will set the MCLK to the value used by the
        standard CL-GD542x BIOS (0x1c). Symptoms of a MCLK that is too high
        can be vertical bands of flickering pixels on the screen, erroneous
        pixels appearing in text, and loosing pixels in the textmode font
        after running X (note that very similar effects can be caused by an
        MCLK setting that is too low).

	Upon start-up, the driver will report the value of the MCLK
	register (check this first), and also any changes that are made.

	Typical MCLK values:
	<descrip>
	<tag/0x1c (50 MHz)/
		This is usually the BIOS default.
		It is forced by the <tt>"slow_dram"</tt> option.
	<tag/0x1f (55 MHz)/
		Value used by the <tt>"med_dram"</tt> option.
		Highest value that
		542x based cards seem to be able to handle with linear
		addressing enabled.
	<tag/0x22 (60 MHz)/
		Value that most (Extended RAS) 542x cards seem to be able to
		handle, used by	the <tt>"fast_dram"</tt> option.
	</descrip>

	The official maximum of the 542x chips is 50 MHz.
	The official spec. for the 5434 is also 50 MHz (0x1c)
	and that for
        the 5429 and 5430 is probably 60 MHz (0x22). Current revisions
	of the 5434 (E and greater) support 60 MHz MCLK in graphics modes,
	and the driver will program this automatically. If it causes
	problems, use the <tt>"slow_dram"</tt> option.

	The driver takes the MCLK into account for clock limits that
	are determined by DRAM bandwidth.

	For the 546x chips, the BCLK is the Rambus access clock.
	Typical values live in the range of 258 MHz to 300 MHz.  If you
	have troubles, such as a black checkerboard pattern on the
	screen, try using the <tt>"med_dram"</tt> or
	<tt>"slow_dram"</tt> options.

	In all cases, if you are not having any problems (performance
	or stability at high dot clocks), it is best not to use any of
	the DRAM options.
<tag>
Option "no_bitblt"
</tag>
	This option, when used with a 5426/28/29/3x/46/6x/754x, will have the 
	effect of
        disabling the use of the BitBLT engine (which the 5424 does not
        have), while retaining some acceleration. This will be useful for
        problems related to functions that use the BitBLT engine.
	Performance is significantly decreased.
<tag>
Option "no_imageblt"
</tag>
        This option is now obsolete. The "xaa_no_color_exp" option has a
        somewhat similar effect.
<tag>
chipset "clgd54xx"
</tag>
	Force detection of the given chipset. Useful if you have a supported
        chipset that is not properly detected, or if you have an unsupported
        chip that might be compatible with a supported one.
<tag>
videoram 1024 (or another value)
</tag>
	This option will override the detected amount of video memory, and
        pretend the given amount of memory is present on the card. This is
        useful on cards with 2Mbyte of memory whose DRAM configuration is
        not compatible with the way the driver enables the upper megabyte of
        memory, or if the memory detection goes wrong. It must be specified
	in the Device section.
<tag>
Option "fifo_conservative" (5424/6/8/9/3x/46/6x/754x)
</tag>
	This option will set the CRT FIFO threshold to a conservative value
	for high dot clocks (&gt;= 65 MHz), reducing performance but hopefully
	alleviating problems with what can be described as flashing
	`streaks', `jitter' or horizontally repeated display areas on the
	screen (especially when	a BitBLT operation is in progress, e.g.
	scrolling).
<tag>
Option "fifo_aggressive" (5424/6/8/9/3x/46/6x/754x)
</tag>
	This option will set the CRT FIFO threshold to an aggressive value;
	it will be the same as that used for lower dot clocks.
        Theoretically it improves performance at high dot clocks, but
        it does not help in the vast majority of cases.  In some
	cases with 546x chips, however, this option can help
	reduce horizontal streaks or otherwise fix abnormal
	display problems (display shifted to the left, etc.).
<tag>
Option "no_2mb_banksel" (542x)
</tag>
	This option will cause the driver not to set the `DRAM bank select'
	bit to enable the upper megabyte of memory on a 2Mbyte card. This
	should be helpful with cards equipped with 512Kx8 DRAMs, as opposed
	to 256Kx4/16 DRAMs, when using a virtual screen configuration that
	uses more than 1Mbyte of memory.
<tag>
Option "probe_clocks"
</tag>
	This option will force probing of dot clocks on the card. This
        should not be necessary, since the clocks are fixed and the same for
        all Cirrus chipsets.
<tag>
Clockchip "cirrus"
</tag>
	This enables programmable clocks. It must be specified in the
	Device section. With this option, the clocks the modes use will
	be automatically selected. Do not specify any Clocks line. This
	option makes a 12.5 MHz clock possible for a 320x200 Doublescan
	mode. Note that some frequencies may be unstable (resulting in
	a `wavy' screen). Only tried
	and tested frequencies (like the default clocks) are guaranteed
	to be stable.
<tag>
Option "linear"  (542x/6/8/9/3x/754x on VL-bus)
</tag>
	This enables linear addressing, which is the mapping of the entire
        framebuffer to a high address beyond system memory, so that SVGA
        bank switching is not necessary. It enhances performance at 256
        colors, and is currently required for 16bpp, 24bpp, and 32bpp. See 
	section 4 for details.
  <tag>
Option "nolinear"  (542x/6/8/9/3x/754x on PCI bus)
</tag>
        Linear addressing is the default mode of operation on any
        PCI-bus chip. For these configurations, this option disables
        linear addressing.
<tag>
Membase 0x00e00000 (or a different address) (542x/6/8/9/3x/46/754x)
</tag>
	This sets the physical memory base address of the linear
        framebuffer. It must be specified in the Device section. It is
	required for non-PCI linear addressing configurations.
<tag>
Option "favour_bitblt" (5426 only)
</tag>
	This option is now obsolete.
<tag>
Option "mmio" (5429, 7548)
</tag>
	This enables the use of memory-mapped I/O to talk to the BitBLT
        engine on the 543x/5429, which is a bit faster. This is option
	has no effect when not using the BitBLT engine (e.g. when using
	"no_bitblt").
<tag>
Option "no_mmio" (543x/4x)
</tag>
	This disables the use of memory-mapped I/O to talk to the BitBLT
        engine on any chip for which it is the default mode of
        operation. 
<tag>
Option "sw_cursor" (542x/3x/46/6x)
</tag>
	This disables use of the hardware cursor provided by the chip. Try
        this if the cursor seems to have problems. In particular, use this
	when using dot clocks greater than 85 MHz on the 5434/6 since those
	chips don't fully support the hardware cursor at those clocks.
<tag>
Option "clgd6225_lcd"
</tag>
	Provides a work-around for problems on the LCD screen of some
	62x5 laptop chipsets with maximum white colors.
<tag>
Option "no_pixmap_cache"
</tag>
	When XAA is used (on any BitBLT chip), this option disables
	the use of a pixmap cache in XAA. It could help with certain
	drawing bugs.
<tag>
Option "xaa_no_color_exp"
</tag>
	When XAA is used, this option disables the use of hardware color
	expansion features by XAA. Again, this might help with certain
	drawing bugs.
<tag>
Option "no_stretch" (754x)
</tag>
	Disable automatic stretching (horizontal and vertical expansion)
	of 640x480 on a 800x600 LCD.
<tag>
Option "pci_retry" (546x)
</tag>
        Enables a performance feature for PCI based cards.  When this
	feature is enabled, the driver code will attempt to transmit
	data on the PCI bus as fast as possible.  For the most part,
	this option is safe, but may cause trouble with other PCI
	devices such as PCI network cards, sound cards, SCSI
	controllers, etc.  When this option is not selected, a safer
	approach (polling the VGA's command queue) is taken.

<sect> Mode issues <p>

The accelerated 256-color driver uses 16K bytes of scratch space in video
memory, and the hardware cursor also uses 1K (2K on the '6X). Consequently, 
a 1024x1024 virtual resolution should not be used with a 1Mbyte card.

On older chips,
the use of a higher dot clock frequencies has a negative effect on the
performance of graphics operations, especially BitBlt, when little
video memory bandwidth is left for drawing (the amount is displayed
during start-up for 542x/3x/46/6x chips).  For the 542x/3x chips, with
default MCLK setting (0x1c) and a 32-bit memory interface, performance
with a 65 MHz dot clock can be half of that with a dot clock of 25
MHz.  So if you are short on memory bandwidth and experience blitting
slowness, try using the lowest dot clock that is acceptable; for
example, on a 14" or 15" screen 800x600 with high refresh (50 MHz dot
clock) is not so bad, with a large virtual screen.

5434-based cards with 2Mbyte of memory do much better at high dot clocks;
the DRAM bandwidth is basically double that of the 542x series. The 543x
chips also make more efficient use of the available DRAM bandwidth. The
same goes for the 544x.

<sect> Linear addressing and 16bpp/24bpp/32bpp modes <p>

Currently the framebuffer code 16-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit pixels  in 
the SVGA
server requires linear addressing.  Option 
"linear" can be specified in a
depth-specific screen section to enable linear addressing; a MemBase
setting (in the device section) is probably also required (although they
are both automatically selected with PCI cards, like 5446, 546x, and some
543x based cards). There
are a number of different card configurations.

If you have a 542x/543x on the ISA bus, and you have 16Mb or more of
system memory, linear addressing is impossible. 16bpp is out, sorry.
If you have less than 14Mb of memory, you may be able to map the
framebuffer at 14Mb, using `<tt>MemBase 0x00e00000</tt>'. That's five zeros
after the `e'. Unfortunately many ISA cards don't support linear
addressing.

If you have a 5424/26/28/29 on VESA local bus, the situation is more
complicated. There are two different types of cards w.r.t. linear
addressing:
<itemize>
<item>Cards that can only map in the lower 16Mb, like cards on the ISA bus.
  This is the case with most cards. The same
  restrictions apply (i.e. you must have less than 16Mb of memory).
<item>Cards that connect address line A26 and always map at 64Mb + 14Mb or
  64Mb. In
  this case specify `<tt>MemBase 0x04e00000</tt>' or `<tt>MemBase
  0x04000000</tt>'. This assumes you have a VLB motherboard implementation
  that implements A26. Alternatively the card may map to 0x2000000, and
  recent cards like the 5429 usually map to 0x03e00000 (62Mb).
</itemize>
You will probably have to rely on trial and error. If you have less
than 16Mb memory, the `wrong' membase setting will result in no graphics
being displayed, but you can probably exit with ctrl-alt-backspace.

If you have &gt;= 16Mb memory, the first type of card (and even the second
type with a stupid VLB motherboard) will result in a crash (probably a
spontaneous hard reboot).

It may be possible to find out the type by visual inspection. If the card
has a pin at A26, it is likely to map beyond 64Mb. To do this, take the card
out. At the VESA local bus pins (this is the smaller strip of connector pins
at the non-slot side of the card), consider the right side (this is the side
of the board where all the chips are mounted). There are 45 pins here. They
are numbered 1 to 45, from the inside (i.e. the one nearest to the card end
is 45). Counting from the inside, the 17th pin is probably not present, then
there are pins at 18-20. The 21st is A30, the 22nd is A28 and the 23rd is
A26. So, if we have no pins at at 21-23, the card doesn't map beyond 64Mb. If
there's only a gap of two pins at 21 and 22 (or they are both present) and
there's a pin at 23, the card does probably map beyond 64Mb. If there's a
little logic near that pin on the card, it's more likely.

With a 543x on the local bus things are simpler (the Cirrus Logic windows
drivers use it), but it is not quite without problems.

With a card on the PCI bus, there is a PCI configuration register that holds
the framebuffer base address, which is read automatically by the driver
if a PCI card is detected. The `scanpci' program 
can read out the PCI configuration and show the base address.

On the VESA local bus, most 543x cards have a default mapping address of
64Mb, with jumper options for 2048Mb and 32Mb. This is probably described in
the documentation that came with the card, or look in the MS-Windows system.ini
file (something with linearaddr = &lt;offset in megabytes&gt;). These different
settings were added by Cirrus Logic after finding that many VLB motherboard
implementations don't implement different address pins. The driver assumes
a default of 64Mb if MemBase isn't specified. A few examples for MemBase:
<tscreen><verb>
	MemBase	0x02000000	32Mb
	MemBase	0x04000000	64Mb
	MemBase	0x80000000	2048Mb
</verb></tscreen>

Finally, for 546X cards, you are in luck:  there are no "issues" to worry
about.  The '6X will always use linear addressing and memory-mapped I/O,
and will use the memory addresses up near 4GB.  Yay for PCI!


The 16bpp and 32bpp modes are now fully accelerated, thanks to XAA. On
more recent chips like the 5436/46 and the 546X, 24bpp is also fully
accelerated.
So although 
there are now up to 4 times as many bits to display, the X server shouldn't
feel overly sluggish.  Note also that the 24bpp and 32bpp modes are only 
supported on a limited set of cards, and with at least 2Mb of memory.

In the <tt>XF86Config</tt> <tt>"Screen"</tt> section, a
<tt>"Display"</tt> subsection must be
defined for each depth that you want to run, with separate Modes
and virtual screen size. Example (2Mb of video memory):
<tscreen><verb>

    SubSection "Display"

<sect> The ``cl64xx'' Driver<label id="cl64xx"><p>
The cl64xx driver supports the cl-gd6440 found in many laptops.  For
example, Nan Tan Computer's NP9200, NP3600, etc., which are OEM-ed by
Sager, ProStar, etc. and Texas Instruments TI4000 series are supported.

The driver works in LCD-only, CRT-only, and the chip's SimulScan mode
which allows one to use both the LCD and external CRT displays
simultaneously.  The LCD and Simulscan modes' resolution is 640x480
while, for CRT-only, the standard VESA modes of 640x480, 600x800, and
1024x768 have been tested.  Interlaced 1024x768 mode has never been
debugged and does not work on the machines tested.

The chip has a documented maximum operating limit for its dot clock
that is related to its core voltage.  Specifically, for 5.0V the
maximum dot clock is 65MHz and for 3.3V the maximum dot clock is
40MHz.  The driver checks the core voltage and limits the maximum dot
clock to the corresponding value.  This translates to a maximum  
resolution of about 1024x768 at a 60Hz refresh rate.  The internal 
frequency generator can be programmed higher than these limits and is
done so during server startup when the clocks are probed which
momentarily exceeding the chip's operating limit.  Once a set of valid
clocks is obtained, I would recommend using Clocks lines in
<tt>XF86Config</tt>.  Doing so will also decrease startup time significantly.
The clocks may be obtained by running the X server -probeonly (see the
XFree86 man page for more information about -probeonly).

The data book indicates that only a configuration of one megabyte of
video memory is supported by the chip.  This size has been directly set
in the driver.  If one finds a need, one should be able to override the
default size in <tt>XF86Config</tt>.  Also, with 1MB of video memory, one should
be able to have a virtual screen size of e.g. 1024x1024 and this is  
possible in CRT-only screen mode.  However, whenever the LCD is in use
(LCD and SimulScan), the chip uses a portion of upper video ram for
its own internal acceleration purposes.  Thus, the maximum video memory
available for virtual resolution in LCD modes is about 0.75MB e.g.
1024x768.  If you set the virtual resolution above this, you will see
what might be described as a compressed aliased band when the
accelerated area is displayed.

Currently, the driver does not support switching of screen modes among
LCD, CRT, and SimulScan, and, at least on the NP9200, the mode must be
chosen at OS boot time (e.g. Linux's LILO) while the BIOS is still
active.  It should be possible to add screen mode type selection as a 
ModeLine flag option in <tt>XF86Config</tt> to allow for dynamic screen mode
selection from within the X server.  Finally, the driver does not currently
support any of the powerdown saving features of the chip nor does it  
shut off the LCD's backlight on screen blank.  I hope to implement all
these features in future releases.

Some notes regarding the CL-GD6420:

The amount of video memory may not always be detected correctly. The driver
source code includes two methods, one defined out. Better specify the amount
of video memory with a VideoRam line in the Device section. Use the standard
640x480 60 Hz standard mode timing with 25.175 MHz dot clock for CRT or
SIMulscan mode; for LCD-only operation, use the same mode timing but with
a dot clock of 16.257 MHz. Standard 56 Hz 800x600 is also supported on
the CRT.

The primary contact for the cl6440 problems with ``cl64xx'' driver is
Randy Hendry <em>&lt;randy@sgi.com&gt;</em>.

<sect> Trouble shooting with the ``cirrus'' driver<p>
First of all, make sure that the default modes selected from your
<tt>XF86Config</tt>
is supported by your monitor, i.e. make sure the horizontal sync limit is
correct. It is best to start with standard 640x480x256 with a 25.175 MHz
clock (by specifying a single horizontal sync of 31.5) to make sure the
driver works on your configuration. The default mode used will always be
the first mode listed in the modes line, with the highest dot clock listed
for that resolution in the timing section.

Note that some VESA standard mode timings may give problems on some monitors
(try increasing the horizontal sync pulse, i.e. the difference between
the middle two horizontal timing values, or try multiples of 16 or 32 for
all of the horizontal timing parameters).
<descrip>
<tag>There is a video signal, but the screen doesn't sync.</tag>
	You are using a mode that your monitor cannot handle. If it is
	a non-standard mode, maybe you need to tweak the timings a bit. If
	it is a standard mode and frequency that your monitor should be able
	to handle, try to find different timings for a similar mode and
	frequency combination.
<tag>Horizontal jitter at high dot clocks.</tag>
	This problem shows especially when drawing operations such as
	scrolling are in progress.
	If you're using a 542x/3x/46/6x/754x, try the 
	<tt>"fifo_conservative"</tt> 
	option. Failing that, you can try the <tt>"fast_dram"</tt> option, 
	or use a lower dot clock.  If that is not sufficient, the 
	<tt>"noaccel"</tt> option or <tt>"no_bitblt"</tt> will
	probably help.  When using a 546x, option
	<tt>"fifo_aggressive"</tt> can also be tried.
<tag>`Wavy' screen.</tag>
	Horizontal waving or jittering of the whole screen, continuously
	(independent from drawing operations).
	You are probably using a dot clock that is too high; it is also
	possible that there is interference with a close MCLK. Try a
	lower dot clock. You can also try to tweak the mode timings; try
	increasing the second horizontal value somewhat. Here's a 65 MHz
	dot clock 1024x768 mode (about 60 Hz) that might help:
<verb>
 "1024x768"     65      1024 1116 1228 1328     768  783  789  818
</verb>
	If you are using programmable clocks with Clockchip <tt>"cirrus"</tt>,
	try disabling it and using the default set of clocks.
<tag>Crash or hang after start-up (probably with a black screen).</tag>
	Try the <tt>"noaccel"</tt> option. If that works,
	try Option <tt>"no_bitblt"</tt> for
	somewhat better performance. Check that the BIOS settings are OK;
	in particular, disable caching of 0xa0000-0xaffff. Disabling hidden
	DRAM refresh may also help.
<tag>
Crash, hang, or trash on the screen after a graphics operation.
</tag>
	This may be related to a bug in one of the accelerated functions, or
	a problem with the BitBLT engine. Try the <tt>"noaccel"</tt> option,
	or the <tt>"no_bitblt"</tt> option. Also check the BIOS settings.
<tag>
`Blitter timeout' messages from the server.
</tag>
	Same as for the above entry.
<tag>
Screen is `wrapped' vertically. (542x/3x/46)
</tag>
	This indicates a DRAM configuration problem. If your card has two
	megabytes of memory, try the <tt>"no_2mb_banksel"</tt> option, or use
	<tt>videoram "1024"</tt> if you only use 1 Mbyte for the virtual
	screen.
<tag>
Corrupted text in terminal window.
</tag>

	This has been reported on non-standard video implementations.
	Use the <tt>"no_bitblt"</tt> option.
<tag>
Streaks or hangs with laptop chipset
</tag>
	This can happen if the dot clock is high enough to leave very
	little bandwidth for drawing (e.g. 40 MHz on a 512K card), and
	(5422-style) acceleration is used.
<tag>
Occasional erroneous pixels in text, pixel dust when moving window-frame
</tag>	
	Probably related to MCLK setting that is too high (can happen
	with linear addressing even though banked mode runs OK).
<tag>
Chipset is not detected.
</tag>
	Try forcing the chipset to a type that is most similar to what
	you have.
<tag>
Incorrect little lines (mostly white) appear occasionally
</tag>
	This may be related to a problem with system-to-video-memory BitBLT
	operations. Try the <tt>"no_imageblt"</tt> option if it annoys you.
<tag>
Textmode is not properly restored
</tag>
	This has been reported on some configurations. In XFree86 3.1
	the SVGA server probe would corrupt a register on the 543x,
	requiring a Chipset line. Normally you should be able to restore
	the textmode font using a utility that sets it (<tt>setfont</tt>,
	<tt>runx</tt>, <tt>restorefont</tt> on Linux).
<tag>
Erratic system behaviour at very high dot clocks
</tag>
	It is possible that high dot clocks on the video card interfere with
	other components in the system (e.g. disk I/O), because of a bad
	card and/or motherboard design. It has been observed on some PCI
	5428-based cards (which are very rare, since the 5428 chip doesn't
	support PCI).
<tag>
No mouse cursor, or cursor appears twice on screen
</tag>
        With high dot clocks, the graphics card's hardware cursor
	doesn't operate correctly.  Try option <tt>"sw_cursor"</tt> or
	use a lower screen refresh.

<tag>
Random/garbage pixels on far right or bottom of screen (546x)
</tag>
        This problem is usually associated with using a virtual
	screen size larger than the screen display size.  The
	garbage pixels are unused portions of the frame buffer
	that result from padding each scanline to an integral
	number of memory tiles.  To eliminate the extra pixels,
	use a screen display mode whose pixel width is evenly
	divisible by 128 / bits per pixel.

<tag>
Screen is wrapped horizontally on right side (546x)
</tag>
        Same as above entry.

<tag>
The screen is initially displayed correctly, but then turns all
white. (546x)
</tag>
        This problem usually happens at high bit depths and while
	the screen is changing rapidly (catting a long file or
	dragging a large window around).  The RamBus memory is
	being overdriven.  Use Option <tt>"med_dram"</tt>, or, if
	the problem persists, Option <tt>"slow_dram"</tt>.

</descrip>
For other screen drawing related problems, try the <tt>"noaccel"</tt>
option (if <tt>"no_bitblt"</tt> doesn't help).

If are having driver-related problems that are not addressed by this document,
or if you have found bugs in accelerated functions, you can try contacting
the XFree86 team (the current driver maintainer, Corin Anderson,
can be reached at <it>corina@the4cs.com</it>), or post in the
Usenet newsgroup "<it>comp.windows.x.i386unix</it>".

In fact, reports (success or failure) are very welcome, especially
on configurations that have not been tested. You can do this
via the BetaReport form (mail to report@XFree86.org). You may want to
keep an eye on forthcoming beta releases at <it>www.xfree86.org</it>.

<sect> Tested Configurations <p>

Version 3.3.3 has had the following configurations tested:

<descrip>
<tag>CL-GD5446 with 2MB memory on PCI bus</tag>

<tag>CL-GD5464 with 2MB memory on PCI bus</tag>

<tag>CL-GD5465 with 4MB memory on PCI bus</tag>

<tag>CL-GD5480 with 4MB memory on PCI bus</tag>

<tag>CL-GD5465 with 4MB memory on AGP bus</tag>

</descrip>

For version 3.3, the following configurations have received a
certain amount of testing:

<descrip>
<tag>CL-GD5446 with 2MB memory on PCI bus</tag>
	Support for dot clocks > 85 MHz has been fixed. At 16bpp, it
	has been reported that some stippled edges of window frames
	may be corrupted or show the wrong colors. The option
	"xaa_no_pixmap_cache" eliminates the problem.

<tag>CL-GD5464 with 4MB memory on PCI bus</tag>

<tag>CL-GD7543 on PCI bus</tag>
	
</descrip>


This is a list of configurations that has received testing with one or
more of the changes introduced in version XFree86 3.2A. The amount of
testing is very small for some of the configurations, and the summaries
may be incomplete. If you can contribute, please do so. For the latest
information check the latest version of this document on
<it>www.xfree86.org</it>.

<descrip>
<tag>CL-GD5426 on VL-bus</tag>
	This configuration was only tested with an early version of
	the XAA code.

<tag>CL-GD5434 with 2MB memory on VL-bus</tag>
	MMIO operation is supported. This configuration was only tested
	with an early version of the XAA code.

<tag>CL-GD5436 with 2MB memory on PCI-bus</tag>
 	Works OK. Non-MMIO operation might have problems.
 
<tag>CL-GD5446 with 2MB memory on PCI bus</tag>
	Works OK in MMIO mode. 32bpp probably doesn't work. The support
	for dot clocks > 85 MHz at 8bpp may or may not work.

<tag>CL-GD5462 with 2MB memory on PCI bus</tag>

<tag>CL-GD5462 with 4MB memory on PCI bus</tag>

<tag>CL-GD5464 with 4MB memory on PCI bus</tag>
	Works OK at 8bpp, 16bpp, 24bpp and 32bpp.  CL-GD5464 works OK at
	16bpp, -weight 555.

<tag>CL-GD7543 on PCI bus</tag> Works for 8bpp, 16bpp on TFT display
	(TI TravelMate 5000).  Although the previous version, 3.2, was
	reported to broken, on some configurations it worked, while
	others were reported not to work correctly. On 800x600
	displays, the recommended dot clock is 40 MHz for TFT and 33.7
	MHz for a DSTN panel, with corresponding horizontal syncs of
	33.7 kHz for TFT and 38.6 kHz for DSTN. However, reports
	indicate that the VESA standard 40 MHz 800x600 timing may cause
	problems. The solution is decrease the fourth horizontal timing
	number or use a dot clock of 36 MHz.
	
</descrip>

Some configurations for which no up-to-date testing data is available:

<descrip>
<tag>CL-GD5429 on VL-bus</tag>
	BitBLT operation should be fixed in 3.2. MMIO does not work,
	but not tested with with 3.2 or 3.2A.
  
<tag>CL-GD5430 on PCI-bus</tag>
	Works OK. 24bpp was broken, but should be fixed in later
        versions (3.2A).

<tag>CL-GD5430, and CL-GD5436 and CL-GD5446 with 1MB memory</tag>
	It would be nice to know whether these chips needs the same
	treatment at 16bpp as the CL-GD5434 with 1MB memory does.

<tag>CL-GD5434 with 1MB memory on PCI bus</tag>
	8bpp, 16pp and 24bpp work OK. 16bpp no longer has "static"
	problems. MMIO operation is supported.

<tag>CL-GD5436 and CL-GD5446 with 1MB memory</tag>
	In particular the FIFO settings for this configuration are uncertain.

<tag>CL-GD7541</tag>

<tag>CL-GD7548</tag>
	Should be compatible with 7543, but untested. Reports indicate
	that it worked with 3.2, and there's no reason why it shouldn't
	work with 3.2A.
