The following is a list of files/directories required for a self-contained
cut-down source tree suitable for building the lbxproxy server.  When
using this cut-down tree, set BuildLBXProxyOnly to YES in
xc/config/cf/xf86site.def.

xc/Imakefile
xc/Makefile
xc/Makefile.ini
xc/RELNOTES.TXT
xc/bug-report
xc/config/
xc/include/
xc/lib/Imakefile
xc/lib/X11/
xc/lib/XExExt/
xc/lib/Xau/
xc/lib/Xbsd/
xc/lib/Xdmcp/
xc/lib/Xext/
xc/lib/xtrans/
xc/programs/Xserver/include/
xc/registry
xc/workInProgress/Imakefile
xc/workInProgress/lbx/Imakefile
xc/workInProgress/lbx/README
xc/workInProgress/lbx/include/
xc/workInProgress/lbx/lib/
xc/workInProgress/lbx/programs/Imakefile
xc/workInProgress/lbx/programs/lbxproxy/

Notes:

1. To start the build, run the following from the 'xc' directoty:

  make -f Makefile.ini World

For some OSs you may need to set BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS.


2. If your system uses shared libraries, and you have the latest patchlevel
of X11R6 installed, you can set DynamicLBXProxyOnly to YES in
xc/config/cf/xf86site.def to have lbxproxy dynamically linked instead of
statically linked against the X libraries.
