                                  Abstract

          Current releases of XFree86 include several tools that can
     help to automate the process of server configuration. Much of the
     existing documentation, however, describes how to do the job manu-
     ally, including many technical details.       For those users with
     esoteric hardware or with the desire to get their hands dirty under
     the hood, this is great, but many users are using common hardware
     and just want to get X up and running quickly.  This guide is for
     them.

1.  Before You Start

There are a few bits of information that you will need to have before you can
setup the server:

      The model name of your video card
            Make sure you know the exact model name of the card.  It may help
            to also know the graphics chipset, RAMDAC, and clock chip used on
            your card.

      The amount of memory on your video card
            Find out how many megabytes of RAM are on your video card.

      Whether or not your card is VGA compatible
            Most cards these days are VGA compatible, but for example, if you
            have and older monochrome card, it might not be.

      Your monitor's specifications
            Specifically, you need to know the horizontal sync rate(s), and
            vertical refresh rate(s).  These are important!  Consult your
            monitor's manual.

      The protocol used by your mouse
            It will help speed up the process, if you know which protocol is
            used by your mouse to communicate. Some mice are capable of using
            two different protocols, although the method of switching between
            them varies.

2.  What to Do - An Overview

There are three tools that can be used to set up XFree86:

   o XF86Setup

   o xf86config

   o xvidtune

XF86Setup primarily uses a graphical user interface and is the preferred tool
for initial setup, but there are a few cases where it can't be used.  If you
are using a card that is not VGA compatible, have a fixed-frequency monitor,
or are running OS/2, you'll not be able to use XF86Setup, read about xf86con-
fig instead.  If you have limited RAM or a slow system, you might be better
off using xf86config as well.

The xf86config program is text based only, but works for almost any hardware
combination.  If you have a fixed frequency monitor that won't work with
standard text modes, you will have to read the necessary documentation and do
the configuration manually.

To get things looking just right, you may need to use xvidtune, a program
that allows you to make adjustments to the displayed image (e.g. make it
wider, move it a little to the left, etc.).  XF86Setup will allow you to run
xvidtune at the appropriate time; if you use xf86config, you can use xvidtune
afterwards.

      All of these are explained in detail in the following sections.  If
you're the type that doesn't like to read the documentation, but would rather
just try and figure your way through things, you can just type XF86Setup now.
If you have problems, the documentation will still be here.

Although it is possible to use XF86Setup from within X to make changes to
your existing configuration, such use is not specifically documented here.
These instructions are primarily for those initially setting up XFree86 on
their system.

3.  Using XF86Setup

XF86Setup will first check around to make sure certain files are installed
and that you are running as root.  If a problem is found, it will display a
message and exit.  Correct the problem (e.g. install the missing files) and
run it again.

3.1  Initial questions

If you have an existing XF86Config file, you will be asked if you would like
to use it to set the default values of various configuration settings.  If
you've already got an (at least somewhat) working configuration you will want
to do this.

If you are running on an OS which has a mouse driver in the kernel (e.g. SCO
or SVR4), you may be asked if you'd like to use it.

Once the questions (if any) are completed, you will see a message indicating
that the program is ready to switch into graphics mode.  Just press Enter.
If you don't get a graphics screen saying Welcome to XFree86 Setup within a
minute, something has probably hung, you can try pressing Ctrl-Alt-Backspace
to switch back to text mode and you'll probably have to use xf86config
instead of XF86Setup.

3.2  Configuration areas

Once the VGA16 server is started, and once the program has finished loading,
you will see a screen with five buttons along the top and three along the
bottom.  The buttons along the top correspond to the general categories of
configuration settings.  They can be done in any order.  Each of these areas
is explained in detail below.  The bottom row consists of the Abort, Done,
and Help buttons.

Abort does as it name implies. It exits the program without saving any
changes that have been made. The one possible exception is the link to the
mouse device. Any change to that is made as soon as Apply is selected.

Done should be selected when you've finished configuration in each of the
various categories.

The Help can be pressed at any time to get on-line help regarding the current
configuration screen.

You should start with configuring your mouse as it will make things a lot
easier to perform the configuration of other categories.

3.2.1  Mouse

The mouse configuration screen is used to get the mouse working properly.
There are key bindings for everything so that you can easily configure the
mouse, if it's not already working.

The screen includes a representation of a white mouse with three buttons.  As
you move your mouse it should show the pointer coordinates on the mouse and
the buttons should turn black as you press the corresponding button on your
mouse.  If that is not happening, then your mouse is not correctly config-
ured.

Along the top is a row of buttons corresponding to the various possible pro-
tocols. There will also be several buttons and a couple of sliders for other
settings, a visual representation of the mouse, and a button to apply any
changes.  There may also be an entry box in which the device can be set along
with a list of possible devices.

First try moving your mouse around and see if the pointer moves correctly.
If so, try testing that the buttons are working properly.  If those are work-
ing as desired, go ahead and go on to another configuration area.

If the mouse pointer doesn't move at all, you need to fix either the mouse
device or the protocol (or both).  You can press 'n' followed by a Tab, to
move to the list of mouse devices and select a different one.  Pressing 'p'
will pick the next available protocol on the list.  After changing these,
press 'a' to apply the changes and try again.  Repeat the process until you
are getting some response from your mouse.

If the mouse pointer or button indicators do something when you move the
mouse, but the pointer is not moving properly, you probably have the wrong
protocol selected.  Try with a different one.

Most mice these days use the Microsoft protocol, the second most common is
MouseSystems.  Some mice do both.  These dual-protocol mice have various
methods of switching between the two protocols.  Some have a switch on the
mouse itself.  Some are switched by sending a certain signal to the mouse
when opening a connection to the mouse.  These signals can be controlled by
using different combinations of the 'ClearDTR' and 'ClearRTS' settings.
Other mice require a button to be depressed when the mouse is opened (when
the mouse driver first tries to talk to it).  If your mouse uses this method,
hold down the appropriate button while selecting apply (pressing 'a').

Once the mouse pointer is moving correctly, test that all three buttons are
working properly. If your mouse only has two buttons, select 'Emulate3But-
tons' and you should be able to press both buttons simultaneously to emulate
the missing middle button.  If not all of the buttons are working, try chang-
ing the 'ChordMiddle' setting or you may be using a protocol that is similar
to that of your mouse, but not quite right.

3.2.2  Keyboard

You need to specify the model and layout of your keyboard (and press apply)
if they are not already correct.  The graphical representation of the key-
board will be updated when you choose a different model.

For non-U.S. keyboards you may wish to choose a variant from the list (at
this time there is only one available variant: nodeadkeys>).

You can also pick from the options to the right, if you wish.

3.2.3  Card

Pick your card from the list.

If there are README files that may pertain to your card the 'Read README
file' button will then be usable (i.e. not greyed out).  Please read them.

If your card is not in the list, or if there are any special settings listed
in the README file as required by your card, you can press the 'Detailed
Setup' button to make sure that the required settings are selected.  Other-
wise, you're finished with configuring your card.

To use 'Detailed Setup': First select the appropriate server for your card.
Then read the README file corresponding to the selected server by pressing
the 'Read README file' button (it won't do anything, if there is no README).

Next, pick the chipset, and Ramdac of your card, if directed by the README
file.  In most cases, you don't need to select these, as the server will
detect (probe) them automatically.

The clockchip should generally be picked, if your card has one, as these are
often impossible to probe (the exception is when the clockchip is built into
one of the other chips).

Choose whatever options are appropriate (again, according to the README).

You can also set the maximum speed of your Ramdac.  Some Ramdacs are avail-
able with various speed ratings.  The max speed cannot be detected by the
server so it will use the speed rating of the slowest version of the speci-
fied Ramdac, if you don't specify one.

Additionally, you can also specify the amount of RAM on your card, though the
server will usually be able to detect this.

3.2.4  Monitor

Enter the horizontal and vertical frequency ranges that your monitor supports
in the corresponding entry boxes near the top of the screen.  You can enter
specific frequencies or ranges of frequencies (separated by hyphens).  If the
monitor supports several different frequencies or ranges, list them all, sep-
arated by commas.

If you can not find this information in you monitor's manual, pick one of the
choices from the list of common monitor capabilities.  The program will use
conservative values for each of these, so you'll get better performance if
you type in the correct values from your monitor manual.

3.2.5  Other

You can probably just skip this one.

3.2.6  Completing the configuration

Once you've finished with the above, press the 'Done' button and then the
'Okay' button which will appear. You will then be switched back to text mode.

3.3  Back to text mode

The program will now attempt to start the appropriate server for your card,
with all of the configuration settings you selected.  If for some reason it
is unable to start the server, you have likely selected an improper setting
and will be asked if you would like to return to the graphical configuration
screen and try again.

3.4  The second server

This is unlikely to happen, but if when the server starts, the display is
unreadable, try pressing Ctrl-Alt-+ (using the plus on the numeric keypad) to
switch to a different video mode.

The display will show an entry box and three buttons.

The first button allows you to run xvidtune to adjust your video modes.  One
important point to keep in mind when using xvidtune is that switching video
modes with Ctrl-Alt-+ is disabled while xvidtune is running.  You must use
the 'Next' and 'Prev' buttons to switch modes.  Because of this, you should
be careful not to move the mouse when pressing either of these.  If by some
chance the mode you switch to doesn't produce a readable display on your mon-
itor, you can then just press the mouse button again to move to the next
(hopefully readable) mode.

The second button causes the settings you've made to be written to the file-
name given in the entry box.  After saving the settings a message will appear
indicating that it has finished. Just press the 'Okay' button and you're
done.

And the third button causes the program to exit without saving any of the
configuration settings.

3.5  Ending text

You are returned to text mode and the program will print a `Configuration
complete.' message.  You should now have a usable configuration file and can
start the X server by whichever method you wish (usually either the 'startx'
command or via 'xdm').

4.  Running xf86config

From a text screen, run the xf86config program.  This program should be run
as root (although not absolutely necessary, it will allow xf86config to do
more of the work for you).  You can press your interrupt character (usually
Control-C or perhaps Delete), at any time to stop the program, if you need
to.  You can just start it over again.

The xf86config program provides instructions on screen as to what you need to
do.  Following are some notes that document the various stages in the pro-
cess. They should help you get through the process quickly and provide some
documentation for those people who like to know what they're getting them-
selves into, before running a program.

4.1  The intro screen

First, xf86config begins by telling you a few things like the fact that it
can help you setup an XF86Config file or that you can do the job yourself
with an editor.  Just read what it says and press Enter when done.

4.2  Getting your PATH right

The program will next check that you have the directory /usr/X11R6 (the stan-
dard installation directory) on your system and tell you that it needs to be
in your PATH environment variable.

It will also check if you have the /usr/X386 directory as used by older (pre
3.0) versions of XFree86.  If by chance you do, it will warn you that
/usr/X11R6 must be before /usr/X386 in your PATH.

If everything is okay, just press Enter and go on, otherwise press Control-C
to exit and make any necessary changes and restart xf86config.

4.3  Mouse setup

Pick the mouse type from the menu and enter the name of the device to which
mouse is connected, as directed.

If you are using an OS (e.g. SVR4, SCO) that has a built in mouse driver that
the Xserver could use, you'll need to edit the XF86Config file to setup your
mouse, so just pick any mouse from the list and press enter when asked for
the device.

If you don't know which protocol your mouse uses, you'll just have to guess
(the xf86config program will give you some hints as to which might be most
likely) and then see the troubleshooting section if it doesn't work when you
run the server.

4.4  Keyboard setup

Simply answer yes to the question regarding keyboard setup.

If there is some reason you need to use the right-alt and control keys for
something else, you can enter no.

4.5  Monitor setup

Setting up a monitor consists of entering the specifications of your monitor
and a description of the model and manufacturer.

You are first asked for the horizontal sync rate.  It is VERY important to
enter the correct value(s) from the manual. If one of the ranges given
matches the rate of your monitor, then pick it, otherwise pick custom and
enter the values from your manual.

Next is the vertical refresh rate. Again, it is VERY important that this
parameter be specified correctly.  Enter it in a manner similar to the hori-
zontal sync rate.

If either rate is mis-specified, it can result in damage to your monitor.

Finally, you are asked for an "identifier", your monitor manufacturer, and
model.  You can just press enter to get through these quickly.

4.6  Selecting your card

You are next asked if you would like to view the database of cards.  Picking
your card from the list will cause the answers to the questions in the next
two sections to be filled in for you and so can save a little time.

If your card does not appear in the list, just press q and enter to skip on
to the next step - where you'll have to answer the questions yourself.

4.7  Server selection

If you selected your card in the previous step, then server selection is easy
- just use the recommendation from the database.

If you have a card which uses one of the chipsets for which a specific server
exists (Mach8, Mach32, Mach64, AGX/XGA, 8514/A, S3, I128, P9000) you'll want
to pick the accel option.

Otherwise you'll probably want to use the SVGA server.

Next, answer yes when the program asks if you want it to set the symbolic
link for you.  If you picked the accel option, you'll also need to indicate
which particular accelerated server to link to.

4.8  Screen/Video configuration

Pick the appropriate option from the list to indicate the amount of memory on
your video card.

Then you are asked to provide and identifier, the manufacturer, and the model
of your card.  You can just press enter to skip through these, if you wish.

Next, the program will ask for the type of RAMDAC and Clockchip on your card.
If your card was in the database, you should just to tell it to use the val-
ues from the database.

If you don't have one of the listed RAMDACs or Clockchips on your card, just
press enter when asked what type you have.  If you do not have a programmable
clock chip, the program will next attempt to probe to find out what clock
rates are supported by your clock chip.

4.9  Mode Selection

Now you get to tell the program which video modes you would like to be able
to run.

The program will show you the common modes that should work with your card
(some might not work with your monitor, but if you've correctly specified the
monitor's sync rates, the X server will just ignore them when it runs).

You could just accept the settings as they are given, but you'll probably
wish to reverse the order.  For example, if you have a card with 1 Meg RAM,
it will list the modes

               "640x480" "800x600" "1024x768" for 8bpp

Select 1 to change the settings for 8bpp and the type 432 to select the
reverse order.

When you've select the modes, in the order you wish, select option 4 to con-
tinue.

4.10  Creating the XF86Config file

The program will now ask if you would like to write the configuration set-
tings you've selected to the file XF86Config. Answer yes.

4.11  Some final notes

Lastly, the program tells you that it's finished its part of this process and
counsels you to check the file before using it.  The next section covers the
changes that are most likely to be needed.

5.  Fixing the XF86Config file

Use an editor to look at the XF86Config file. Here are some things that may
need to be changed:

   o If you are running an operating system which has built-in mouse support,
     you'll want to change the Pointer section.  Specifically, you should set
     the Protocol to OSMouse (SCO) or Xqueue (SVR4, some SVR3) and you should
     remove the Device line.

   o If you are running a system with the Xqueue event driver and would like
     to use it, change the Protocol setting in the Keyboard section to
     Xqueue.

Once you are satisfied that the configuration is correct, copy the XF86Config
file to /usr/X11R6/lib/X11 and run the 'startx' command.

You should now have a running X server.  If it's running but the display
doesn't look as good as you think it should (i.e.  it doesn't fill the whole
screen, it's off-center, it's wrapping around on one side, etc.) see the sec-
tion on xvidtune.  If there is some other problem, see the troubleshooting
section.

6.  Running xvidtune

If you need to make adjustments to the video display, xvidtune is the tool to
use.

Simply enter the command xvidtune from a shell prompt within an xterm.  Read
the warning and click on OK.  Next click on the Auto button.

Now click on whatever combination of Up/Down/Left/Right
Shorter/Taller/Wider/Narrower is need to adjust the display to your liking.

If you are using a recent S3-based card there will be some extra buttons and
entries at the bottom (InvertVCLK, EarlySC, and Blank Delays). These can help
solve problems of the display wrapping around a few pixels.

Once the display has been adjusted properly, press the show button to print-
out the correct ModeLine to put in the XF86Config to make the server always
use the current display settings.  To aid in copying this information to your
XF86Config file, the modeline is also made the current selection allowing you
to just paste it into your editor.

If you would like to adjust your other modes, you can click on the Next and
Prev buttons to switch modes.

When you are through using xvidtune simply press on the Quit button.

7.  Troubleshooting

Since you're reading this, something must not have gone the way you had hoped
(or else you just really enjoy reading).

Below are listed some common problems that may occur during configuration and
some hints for solving them.  However, there are just too many different com-
binations of hardware and software configurations, and, well, just too many
things that can go wrong, for this document and the tools it documents, to
cover every case.

If after trying the steps in the previous sections and checking the hints in
this section, you still are unable to get your system working, you'll have to
read the full documentation.  Read the README file for your card and OS (if
they exist), the XFree86 Configuration Guide (README.Config), and the
XF86Config man page.

You should also look at the XFree86 FAQ <URL:http://www.XFree86.org/FAQ> for
more up-to-date information, especially if you are trying to configure a
fairly new card.

If all else fails, you can try posting a message to comp.windows.x.i386unix
or comp.os.linux.x or send email to XFree86@XFree86.org.

7.1  The mouse doesn't move correctly, it stays in one area of the screen

You've selected the wrong protocol for your mouse. Try a different one.

7.2  The server doesn't start, it says the mouse is busy.

Well, it's probably right.  This most often happens on Linux systems that
have gpm running.  Kill the gpm process and try startx again.

7.3  The middle button doesn't work.

There's no easy answer to this one.  It's a lot of trial and error.  You need
to make sure you're running the right protocol for your mouse.

Many three button mice are "dual protocol" which means that they have both a
2-button and 3-button mode. The way to get the mouse to switch into 3-button
mode (which usually then uses MouseSystems protocol) varies between different
models.

You may need to slide a switch on the mouse or hold down the middle button
when starting the server.  Other methods of switching modes can be done by
the server, you just have to find the right combination of settings for your
mouse.  See the Pointer section of the XF86Config man page for a complete
list of settings.

7.4  The display is shifted to the left/right/top/bottom

See the section on xvidtune.

7.5  I don't appear to have xf86config or xvidtune on my system

Hmmm. Three possibilities:

  1.  You have a version of XFree86 that is older than 3.1.2.  If this is the
      case then you probably aren't reading this document either, because it
      wasn't included in 3.1.2 and earlier releases.  Please upgrade to the
      latest version.

  2.  Your PATH is not set correctly. Make sure it includes the bin directory
      for the XFree86 binaries (usually, /usr/X11R6/bin

  3.  You don't have a complete installation of XFree86.  Go back to wherever
      you got XFree86 and get the missing pieces.
