			PEX-SI Porting Guide

This document is intended for those users who wish to modify the PEX-SI.
It is an extension of the Architecture Specification, and it provides
implementation specific information that will help you to compile, port, and
customize the PEX-SI.

This document is still in progress. It does contain a lot of good information,
and is organized fairly well.  We hope you find it useful.

This directory contains the PostScript files you need to print the User Guide.  

	cover.ps -- The cover sheet
	contents.ps -- The table of contents
	tables.ps -- The list of tables
	figures.ps -- The list of figures
	doc.ps -- The chapter and appendix body pages.
	index.ps -- The index

On most systems you can use lpr to print the files.  You should print in the 
order listed above so you do not have to collate.  The document is designed 
to be double sided, and each part of the document (i.e. table of contents, 
tables and figures listings, chapters and index) begins on an odd page number.  
You may have to supply some blank pages before copying.

This directory also contains the document troff source files. The document 
consists of 6 files:

   cover -- The cover sheet
   intro.pg -- The introduction, including the compile options.
   api.pg -- 2 chapters covering the porting issues of PEX-API and InsPEX.
   server.pg -- An introduction to porting the server, inc. diPEX and osPEX.
   resources.pg -- 3 chapters covering the 3 upper level modules of PEX-ME.
   trans_rend.pg -- 2 chapters covering the Transformation & Rendering modules.

In addition, this directory contains this README and a Makefile.  The targets
included in the Makefile are:

	all --	Troffs all document files into dit (device independent troff) files.
		It also creates an index, table of contents, and table and figure 
		listings.  The resultant files are cover.dit, contents.dit 
		(table of contents), tables.dit, figures.dit, doc.dit (all chapters), 
		and index.dit. 

		Note: You will have to provide your own mechanism for converting
		the files to PostScript files if you are going to use the Makefile. 

	clean -- If you modify the text in anyway and want to `re-make' the
		document, you should first do a ``make clean'' before doing a 
		``make all''.  This target will remove all dit files, the 
		slush.file and the outline file created in the previous make.
