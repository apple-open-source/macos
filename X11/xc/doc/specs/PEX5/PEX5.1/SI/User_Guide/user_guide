This chapter introduces Ins\s-1PEX\s+1, the \s-1PEX-SI\s+1 test suite, and
gives detailed instructions on how to use it and how to interpret
the results from using the tests.
.H 3 "Purpose of the Ins\s-1PEX\s+1 Test Suite"
.LP
The goal of Ins\s-1PEX\s+1 is to test compliance of the
\s-1PEX-SI PHIGS/PHIGS PLUS\s+1 C binding (in connection with a
\s-1PEX\s+1 server) with the \s-1PHIGS\s+1 and \s-1PHIGS PLUS\s+1 standard.
It is not intended to verify \s-1PEX\s+1 at the protocol level.
Nor is it intended to be a complete \s-1PHIGS\s+1 conformance test suite,
or to be a useful performance metric.
.LP
Ins\s-1PEX\s+1 is intended to be portable and useful for developers porting the
\s-1PEX\s+1 Sample Implementation (\s-1PEX-SI\s+1) to different hardware platforms.
.H 3 "Description of Test Methods"
.LP
Ins\s-1PEX\s+1 uses two techniques to test the \s-1PEX\s+1 implementation:
.IP \(bu
Completely automatic testing, using \s-1PHIGS\s+1 inquiry functions to read
back system states and data structures, and \s-1X\s+1 functions to read
back pixel values.
.IP \(bu
Testing through image comparison, comparing what is rendered on the
screen (retrieved with \s-1X\s+1 functions) with a set of known good images.
Slight differences in implementations may require a one-time manual
calibration, in which case a user must inspect images flagged as
different and mark them as acceptable or not acceptable.
An \s-1X\s+1-based tool is provided for this purpose.
.LP
.IX "Inspector"
Many tests use an interpreter for faster execution time and more efficient
test development.  Tests requiring verification of pixels use Xlib to retrieve 
pixel and color map information.  The resulting images are either verified 
automatically or are compared against saved images.  An \s-1X\s+1-based tool, Inspector,
is supplied for comparing images against saved reference images and saving the 
new images as acceptable images if desired.
.H 3 "The NewT Interpreter"
.IX "NewT"
.IX "interpreter"
.LP
In order to reduce the total execution time of the Ins\s-1PEX\s+1 test suite,
as well as to shorten the edit-compile-run cycle for test developers,
many tests in Ins\s-1PEX\s+1 are written for the NewT interpreter.  NewT (for
New Tool) is a package developed at Sun Microsystems, Inc., for the creation of
special-purpose interpreters.  The interpreter language's syntax contains elements of
csh and C and is tailored for testing.  Ins\s-1PEX\s+1
contains as an integral part \fIpexint\fR, an interpreter for \s-1PHIGS\s+1 and
graphics testing functions.  The source files for \fIpexint\fR are included,
so that the interpreter's functions can be modified and extended.
.LP
.IX "NewT"
.IX "interpreter"
A man page in the NewT source directory includes an explanation of how the
interpreter is built, a description of the language syntax, and instructions
on how to use the interpreter.
.H 3 "Image Comparison and the Inspector"
.IX "Inspector"
.IX "InsPEX" "" "Ins\s-1PEX\s+1"
.IX "test suite"
.LP
Unlike \s-1X\s+1, the \s-1PEX\s+1 standard does not contain rigid requirements
for pixel accuracy; it is expected that different hardware and
software implementations will render primitives differently.  In
order to provide the test suite with the flexibility to handle
wide-ranging implementations, an image comparison method is
used.
.LP
The Ins\s-1PEX\s+1 test suite is supplied with a set of reference
images for the tests that use image comparison.  When the
test is run, the image retrieved from the screen is compared
against the reference image.  If it matches, the test succeeds;
otherwise, the test fails and the non-matching image is saved
for later examination.
The test failure message in the log will state that image comparison is
required.
.LP
.IX "Inspector" 
After the test has been run, the suite user can run
Inspector, an \s-1X\s+1-based tool for comparing images from test
suite runs against the reference images.  Inspector displays
the images side by side and provides a function for highlighting
differences between the images.  If the user decides that
the differing image is acceptable, he can accept the
image and move it into a directory of local reference images.
Subsequent runs of the test can then compare against
this local reference, and pass if they match the previously approved image.
If the user marks the image under comparison
as rejected, subsequent test images that match this image
are logged as matching a known bad image.
.LP
The recommended test sequence, then, is to do a complete run of
the test suite, invoke the Inspector and verify or reject
any images that do not match the references; then, do another
run of Ins\s-1PEX\s+1 that takes into account the results of
the Inspector session.
.H 2 "Building the Suite"
.IX "pexint"
.IX "libinspex.a"
.LP
The Ins\s-1PEX\s+1 suite is not built automatically when the rest of
the \s-1PEX-SI\s+1 is built.  The image comparison tool, \fL\s-1inspector\fR\s+1,
must be compiled separately as described below.
The interpreter and the C-based tests are meant to be compiled by
the test suite's run script, \fL\s-1inspex.sh\fR\s+1.
The interpreter is preserved after compilation, but the individual C tests
are deleted after they are compiled and run to save disk space.
(The \fL\s-1-keep\fR\s+1 command line argument will preserve the individual
C tests.  For more information on \s-1\fL-keep\fR\s+1 see Table
.XR @NumberOf(inspex_options) in Section
.XR @NumberOf(inspex_args)).
.LP 
If the user wishes to compile \fL\s-1pexint\fR\s+1 separately, this can
be done using the \fL\s-1Makefile\fR\s+1 in the \fL\s-1tools/pexint\fR\s+1 directory.
Please examine this \fL\s-1Makefile\fR\s+1 to ensure that all paths are properly
specified on your system, and
note that it is vital to supply \fL\s-1CPPFLAGS=-DNEWT\fR\s+1 as an
argument to make in order for the interpreter to be built correctly.
.H 3 "Compiling Inspector"
.LP
Versions of Inspector are available using the XView toolkit supplied
on the contrib tape for X11R4, or the Athena Widgets.
All toolkit-specific code is isolated in
two files by a toolkit-independent interface, so porting
to other toolkits should be straightforward.
Note that the tool does not itself use \s-1PEX\s+1 \(em it only uses toolkit and Xlib
functions for image display and user interaction.  Thus, it need
not be run on the server or system under test: it can be run
any time, on any machine running an \s-1X\s+1 server.

These variables can be set to any additional required
compiler flags for the compile and link phases, respectively;
they will be used in the compilation of the interpreter and C-based tests.
If there are multiple words in these variables, they should be enclosed
in both single and double quotes so that the grouping isn't lost

If the server dies during test execution, and this variable is set, 
the script will attempt to use the command to restart the server 
before continuing.  The command should exit after starting the server, 
since the test script does not run it in the background.

are being sampled by drawing a box around the sampled area.
Useful for analyzing failures, but may cause subsequent false failures
by putting incorrect pixel values on the screen.
.IP "\s-1MACROPATH\s+1"
Interpreter scripts search this path for macro files.
The default set by \fL\s-1inspex.sh\fR\s+1

the current directory and then the directory containing
shared macro files.
You should not need to set this unless you want to substitute
different macro definitions, or if you are running
the \fL\s-1pexint\fR\s+1 interpreter outside of \fL\s-1inspex.sh\fR\s+1,
in which case you will have to set it to a value such as the one above
to run any Ins\s-1PEX\s+1 test scripts.
.IP "\s-1I_CLIENT_SIDE\s+1"
If set, this variable will direct most tests to
call \fIpopen_xphigs()\fR with appropriate arguments to specify
client-side structure storage, rather than calling \fIpopen_phigs()\fR,
which would give the default behavior, server-side storage.
.IP "\s-1I_NO_MONITOR\s+1"
Although single-process execution (without \fL\s-1phigsmon\fR\s+1) is
not yet implemented, \s-1I_NO_MONITOR\s+1 will cause most

\s-1-a <test-area-names>\s+1@T{
The user may specify one or more specific test areas; 
all subsequent arguments up to the next option flag or

The file name extension (\fL\s-1.c\s+1\fR or \fL\s-1.pi\s+1\fR) is optional.
The test name alone will generally be
enough if the tests have not been moved from

Two \fL\s-1include\fR\s+1 files, \fL\s-1pdt.h\fR\s+1 and \fL\s-1wdt.h\fR\s+1, are used to
specify implementation-dependent information about the expected
contents of the \s-1PHIGS\s+1 Description Table and the Workstation
Description Table, respectively.  When the script \fL\s-1inspex.sh\fR\s+1
is executed, it checks for the existence of these files
in the directory \fL\s-1$INSPEXDEST/include\fR\s+1; if they do not
exist, they are copied from \fL\s-1$INSPEXHOME/include\fR\s+1.
A set of C-based tests includes these files, and tests that
the inquired values match the expected.
.LP
.IX "INSPEXHOME" "" "\s-1INSPEXHOME\s+1"
.IX "INSPEXDEST" "" "\s-1INSPEXDEST\s+1"
If the expected default contents of these description tables
are different than those for \s-1PEX-SI\s+1, the \fL\s-1pdt.h\fR\s+1 and \fL\s-1wdt.h\fR\s+1
files should be copied from \fL\s-1$INSPEXHOME/include\s+1\fR to
\s-1\fL$INSPEXDEST/include\s+1\fR, and modified appropriately.
In this case, however, the user should be careful not to use
the \fL\s-1-clean_all\fR\s+1 option of \fL\s-1inspex.sh\fR\s+1
as this option would cause any modifications to the \fL\s-1pdt.h\fR\s+1

As mentioned previously, the \s-1X\s+1 utility \fIxdpyinfo\fR must be found in the
current command search path.
.LP
.IX "window manager"
.IX "olwm"
The server should not be running a window manager, unless the
window manager is one that does not wait for the user to position
new windows (\fIolwm\fR is one such window manager).  Even with such
a window manager available, one should consider running without
it as it may influence window placement, which in turn may 
influence the rendering of primitives.  A window
manager may be necessary, however, if the \s-1PEX\s+1 library is \s-1ICCCM\s+1
compliant and depends on the window manager to load its color map.
.LP
\s-1PEX-SI\s+1 provides two scripts in the \fL\s-1mit/extensions/test/InsPEX\fR\s+1 directory
that will help you to set up the runtime environment for Ins\s-1PEX\s+1:  
.IP \fIstartpex\fR 13
This script sets the environment variables and executes the command that starts the server.
The script contains several environment variables that identify the 
root of the X source tree, the name of the server executable,
paths of other executables needed when running the server,
and paths of the font files needed by the server.
You will need to set the variables in this script to suit your runtime environment
before running Ins\s-1PEX\s+1.  Default values are provided in the script.
.IP \fIrun_InsPEX\fR 13
This script sets the necessary environment variables and calls \fL\s-1inspex.sh\fR\s+1 to
run the Ins\s-1PEX\s+1 test suite.
If a \s-1PEX\s+1 server is not already running when this script is executed,
one will be started.
A log file is created in the directory specified by the environment variable
\s-1INSPEXLOG\s+1.
You will need to set the variables in this script to suit your runtime environment
before running Ins\s-1PEX\s+1.  Default values are provided in the script.
.H 3 "Testing From Within the Server"
.LP
.IX "inspex.sh"
The preferred way to run \fL\s-1inspex.sh\fR\s+1 is to execute it from a screen
or terminal other than the one that the \s-1PEX\s+1 server is running on.
If the suite is not being run from another screen or terminal
(that is, if it is being started from a window on the server being tested),
there is the potential problem of a server crash killing the
test suite process before the test script has a chance to restart
the server with \s-1SERVER_RESTART_CMD\s+1.
.IX "SERVER_RESTART_CMD" "" "\s-1SERVER_RESTART_CMD\s+1"
.LP
To solve this problem, we have supplied a utility
called \fL\s-1newpgrp\fR\s+1 (for \s-1NEW\s+1 Process GRouP),
which will execute a command in a process that is disassociated
from the current process group.  \fL\s-1newgrp\fR\s+1 takes a
command name and a list of arguments on the command line to be
executed in the new process, for example:
.IP
\fL\s-1host% \f(LBnewpgrp inspex.sh -a archive strcon\fR\s+1
.LP
This utility is a short C program residing
in \fL\s-1.../test/InsPEX\s+1\fR.  \fL\s-1newgrp\fR\s+1 can be
compiled with the following command:
.IP
\s-1\fLhost% \f(LBcc newpgrp.c -o $\s-1INSPEXDEST\s+1/newpgrp\fR\s+1
.KS
.H 2 "Analyzing the Results"
.H 3 "Format of Log Messages"
.LP
.IX "INSPEXDEST" "" "s-1INSPEXDEST\s+1"
.IX "log messages"
The test script \fL\s-1inspex.sh\fR\s+1 places the output in a 
file called \fL\s-1ilogMM.DD.HHMM\fR\s+1, (for example, \fL\s-1ilog02.21.1232\fR\s+1), 
in the \s-1$INSPEXDEST\s+1 directory.
The script records information such as the date, machine name,
and value of the \s-1DISPLAY\s+1 variable.  If any \fL\s-1make\fR\s+1 operation
fails, the output of the \fL\s-1make\fR\s+1 is recorded in the log file.
Then the output of each test is logged.
.KE
.LP
After completion, every test outputs a message containing the test
name, \s-1PASSED\s+1 or \s-1FAILED\s+1, and a brief description of what is tested.
If a failure is detected, a message of the form:
.IP
\s-1\fL<testname>: failed: <description of what happened>\fR\s+1
.LP
.IX "MAXFAIL" "" "\s-1MAXFAIL\s+1"
is printed.  The test will continue on if possible, until the number of
failures reaches $\s-1MAXFAIL\s+1.  If a test cannot be compiled, 
causes a core dump before completion, or crashes the server, this
is detected by \fL\s-1inspex.sh\fR\s+1 and is also logged (\fL\s-1inspex.sh\fR\s+1 uses the
X utility \fIxdpyinfo\fR to verify the health of the server).
.LP
If a test prints a message containing the word \s-1ERROR\s+1, this means that
something unanticipated has happened \(em either an error in a system
or testing function, or a failure in the library under test other
than what the test is looking for (for example, if a rendering
test cannot open a workstation).  Such messages should also contain
some descriptive text describing what happened.  We consider
a \fIfailure\fR to mean that the test operated properly and found
something wrong in the library being tested; we consider an
\fIerror\fR to mean that the test did not work as expected \(em something
was wrong in the test software, the system in general, or 
in the library functions that the test assumed would work.
.H 3 "Image Comparison Failure Messages"
.IX "images"
.LP
If a test uses the image comparison method, and an image does
not match the local or master reference image, several different
failure messages can result:
.IP "\s-1\fL<testname>: failed, pending manual comparison of image \
<imagename>\fR\s+1"
This means that the image did not match the reference
image found; we do not know whether it is correct or not.
It also does not match any saved image that is marked
as incorrect.  The comparison tool, \fIinspector\fR, must
be used to compare the image to the reference.
.IX "inspector"	
.IP "\s-1\fL<testname>: failed - image comparison (<imagename> \
matches known bad image)\fR\s+1" 
This means that the image did not match
the reference image, but did match an image in the
current images directory that has been marked as
rejected; we know that this image is incorrect and need not
look at it again.
.IP "\s-1\fL<testname>: failed - no reference image for <imagename> \
(saving current image)\fR\s+1" 
This message should not be seen unless
the test case is new, or the reference image is
for some reason not present.  If it is a new test case,
this saved image should be viewed with the comparison
tool \(em if it is acceptable, it can be accepted into
the local reference, and then manually copied into
the master reference if desired.
.LP
The image names mentioned above may not be the same as the test
file name, since one test file might create several images.
The image name corresponds to the name of the file the image is 
stored in.
.LP
The images are stored in a binary run-length-encoded
format developed for Ins\s-1PEX\s+1; pixels are stored along with color
map information, so that comparison of images can be done by
comparing the \s-1RGB\s+1 values that were in the color table for each pixel.
.IX "pexint"
The format is described in a comment 
in \fL\s-1$\s-1INSPEXHOME\s+1/tools/pexint/pixutils.c\s+1\fR,

the user will probably want to redirect this into a log file.

On startup, the tool displays two empty boxes, labelled \fIreference image\fR
and \fIcurrent image\fR.
To the right of these boxes is a current file name, a current file status (either
\s-1REJECTED\s+1 or \s-1UNSEEN\s+1), a menu with a set of buttons, and a scrolling list
of file names.  The file name list contains the names of the image files
in \fL\s-1$INSPEXDEST/currimages\fR\s+1; the user may scroll this list and select a
file name.  The meaning and action of the buttons is as follows:
.IX "currimages"
.LP
.IX "localrefimages"
.IP \fBAccept\fR 15
Active only when an image is displayed.
Marks the image as accepted by moving it into 
\fL\s-1$INSPEXDEST/localrefimages\s+1\fR, deleting from \fL\s-1currimages\fR\s+1,
and removing any \s-1REJECTED\s+1 marking from the file.
The boxes, status line, and file name are cleared (since
the file is no longer in \fL\s-1currimages\fR\s+1, it is no longer 
under consideration).
.IP \fBReject\fR 15
Active only when an image is displayed.
Marks the image's file as being incorrect by 
appending a hyphen (-) to the filename.  The status line becomes
\fL\s-1REJECTED\s+1\fR.
.IP "\fBMark Unseen\fR" 15
Active only when an image is displayed.
Marks the image's file as unseen by removing
a hyphen (-) from the file name, if present.  The status line
becomes \fL\s-1UNSEEN\s+1\fR.
.IP "\fBShow Diffs\fR" 15
This button redisplays both images so
that only those pixels that are different from the
corresponding pixels in the other are displayed.  The rest
of the pixels are set to the background color.  This button
is a toggle; when pressed, the label changes to \fL\s-1Show Normal\s+1\fR.
Pressing it again reverses the action.
.IP \fBLoad\fR 15
.IX "refimages"
This button loads the image file currently
selected in the scrolling list.  This image is displayed in the right box.
If a reference image exists in either
\fL\s-1$INSPEXDEST/localrefimages\s+1\fR (checked first) or
\fL\s-1$INSPEXHOME/refimages\s+1\fR, it is displayed in the left box.
The pathname of the reference file is printed below
the left box, or \fL\s-1No reference image available\s+1\fR 
if no reference image is found.  Pressing this button again
is a good way to force a redraw of the images.
.IP \fBQuit\fR 15

.LP
The Inspector follows the \s-1X\s+1 Window System Inter-Client Communications
Convention Manual (\s-1ICCCM\s+1) Version 1.0, Section 6.4 in the way it
relies on the window manager to install the colour maps for the two
image subwindows.  The color maps for these windows should be loaded
by the window manager when the mouse is moved into each subwindow.  If
the window manager in use is not \s-1ICCCM\s+1-compliant, it may not correctly
load the color maps, and the images will not be shown in the correct
colors.  If this is the case, there is a crude workaround: setting the
environment variable \s-1INS_MULTIWIN\s+1 before starting the tool.  If this
variable is in the environment, the tool creates the image windows as
separate \s-1X\s+1 windows (children of the root).  The user may have to
arrange these windows manually into good positions, but the window
manager should be able to handle the color maps correctly.  The tool's
main window will initially appear over the image windows, but loading
an image will raise the image windows to the top.
.IX "INS_MULRIQIN" "" "\s-1INS_MULTIWIN\s+1"

Note that it is generally necessary to move the mouse into the image subwindows
to force the loading of colormaps and see the images in their correct colors.
.H 2 "Running Tests Outside the Script"
.LP
Though the Ins\s-1PEX\s+1 test suite as a whole is meant to be
run using the script \fL\s-1inspex.sh\fR\s+1, it is sometimes desireable
to run individual tests from outside the script, especially when trying to
analyze a failure.
The environment variables \s-1PAUSE\s+1 and \s-1SHOWPIX\s+1 are also most
useful when running a test individually, without the overhead of starting
a test run.  
.H 3 "Compiling and Running C-Based Tests"
.LP
The script \fL\s-1inspex.sh\fR\s+1 runs C-based tests by copying them
to the directory \fL\s-1$INSPEXDEST/tmp\fR\s+1 and compiling them using
the \fL\s-1Makefile\fR\s+1 there (the \fL\s-1Makefile\fR\s+1 is copied there
from \fL\s-1$INSPEXHOME/testcases/shared\fR\s+1 if it does not already exist.)
The user can compile the C-based tests manually, after examining the
\fL\s-1Makefile\fR\s+1 and ensuring that all values are set properly there or on
the \fL\s-1make\fR\s+1 command line.
.LP
The C-based tests make use of the library \fL\s-1libinspex.a\fR\s+1, which
is built in \fL\s-1$INSPEXDEST/lib\fR\s+1.  If this library does not
already exist, it will be built automatically, provided
that \fL\s-1$INSPEXHOME\fR\s+1 and the other variables are set properly.
.H 3 "Running Interpreter Scripts"
.LP
Once the interpreter is compiled, either manually or
by \fL\s-1inspex.sh\fR\s+1, all that is required to run it
on a test script is to make sure that all the necessary environment
variables normally set by \fL\s-1inspex.sh\fR\s+1 are set in the current
environment.  The most important of these, beyond those required
to run \fL\s-1inspex.sh\fR\s+1 itself, is \fL\s-1MACROPATH\fR\s+1 \(em
this is a colon-separated list of directories in which the interpreter
looks for other interpreter files that are read using the \fIsource\fR
interpreter command.  
For Ins\s-1PEX\s+1 tests, all macro files are either in the test area
directory itself, or in \fL\s-1$INSPEXHOME/testcases/shared\fR\s+1, so the
correct value for this variable is ``\fL\s-1.:$INSPEXHOME/testcases/shared\fR\s+1.''
.LP
The script \fL\s-1inspex.sh\fR\s+1 builds the interpreter \fL\s-1pexint\fR\s+1
in \fL\s-1$INSPEXDEST/bin\fR\s+1.  \fL\s-1pexint\fR\s+1 can be run as a
command with the test script name as an argument.  The scripts are run most 
easily by first changing to the test area's directory
under \fL\s-1$INSPEXHOME/testcases\fR\s+1.  For example:
.IP
.nf
\fL\s-1csh% \f(LBcd $INSPEXHOME/testcases/utils\fR\s+1
\fL\s-1csh% \f(LBalias pi $INSPEXDEST/bin/pexint\fR\s+1
\fL\s-1csh% \f(LBpi rotate.pi\fR\s+1
.fi
.LP
The manual page for the interpreter's language, construction,
and usage is in \fL\s-1tools/newt/newt.man\fR\s+1; it describes the various
options and capabilities of the interpreter, including tracing,
source-level debugging, and automatic C translation.  
The \fL\s-1-t\fR\s+1 tracing option can be useful for tracking
down where a crash occurs:\ \  it tells the
interpreter to print out each function call before it is made.
The manual page also describes the interpreter language,
and will be useful if you want to modify tests or add your own.

Graphics Performance Characterization (\s-1GPC\s+1) is a set of programs 
intended to standardize graphics performance measures by establishing a benchmark
to be used in comparing the performance of various graphics platforms.
\s-1GPC\s+1 is an effort that has been underway for more than four years, with several 
leading industrial sponsors (Sun, \s-1IBM\s+1, \s-1DEC\s+1, \s-1HP\s+1, 
and others) led by the NCGA (National Computer Graphics Association).
.LP
.IX "Picture-Level Benchmark" "" "Picture-Level Benchmark, (\s-1PLB\s+1)"
The performance characterization is achieved by a set of programs called the 
\s-1PLB\s+1 (Picture-Level Benchmark) programs.  These programs are designed to
measure the performance of graphics display on a screen.  SimGraphics of
Pasadena, California, has been the primary developer of \s-1PLB\s+1 programs.
The current version is Release 1.1 from SimGraphics and NCGA. 
.LP
The SimGraphics \s-1PLB\s+1 programs have been ported to the \s-1PEX-API\s+1,
and the ported versions are included in the \s-1PEX-SI\s+1 release.
These programs have been provided as a cooperative effort between \s-1NCGA\s+1
and the \s-1PEX-SI\s+1 project.  There are use restrictions and warnings
associated with the use of these programs for other than implementation testing
purposes.  Basically, the restrictions are twofold:
.BP
These sources are \fInot\fR to be used to measure and subsequently
publish performance statistics in any way that might relate to the
actual measurement methods being used by the \s-1NCGA\s+1-based \s-1GPC\s+1 group.
.BP
These tests and sources are subject to change without ntoice by SimGraphics
or \s-1NCGA\s+1

The \s-1PLB\s+1 programs consist of three parts:
.NP
Benchmark Interface Format (\s-1BIF\s+1)
.NP
Benchmark Timing Methodology (\s-1BTM\s+1)
.NP
Benchmark Report Format (\s-1BRF\s+1)
.LP
The \s-1BIF\s+1 consists of two parts: the \s-1BIF\s+1 Geometry file and 
the \s-1BIF\s+1 Verb file.  The \s-1BIF\s+1 Geometry file contains structures 
that define the geometry and attributes of the data to be displayed.
The \s-1BIF\s+1 Verb file contains the commands that control the \s-1PLB\s+1 program flow.
.LP
The \s-1PLB\s+1 programs included with \s-1PEX-SI\s+1 distribution are complete
with the exception of support for the \s-1NURB\s+1 Curve and Surface
primitives and the \s-1PIXEL_MAP\s+1 primitive.
The \s-1BIF\s+1 geometry files provided in this release test the majority
of the \s-1PHIGS\s+1 primitives and attributes.
When used, these files generate displays on the screen in a predetermined
sequence.  The program delivered with \s-1PEX-SI\s+1 is called \fIplbpex\fR.

If the \fIplbpex\fR program has not been built automatically, you can
create it by typing \fL\s-1make all\fR\s+1 in
the \fL\s-1mit/demos/gpc\s+1\fR directory. 
The executable created is named \fL\s-1plbpex\fR\s+1.
.LP
To run the \s-1GPC\s+1 program, you must be in the \fL\s-1objects\fR\s+1 subdirectory,
and you must have write permission in that directory because the program will be 
creating and writing to an error file.  Type:
.IP

The \fL\s-1filename\fR\s+1 must be one of the \fI.vrb\fR files located in
the \fL\s-1objects\fR\s+1 directory.  The options are defined as follows:

\fIplbpex\fR creates its own window and uses the
same methods as the \s-1API\s+1 for looking for the correct visual.
It uses the \fI*.geo\fR and \fI*.bif\fR files as it runs.

All \s-1PEX\s+1 clients and \s-1X\s+1 clients are run in a similar way.
The environment variable \s-1DISPLAY\s+1 should be set to the screen or display that
you wish to use (for example, \fL\s-1unix:0\fR\s+1).
If you have done a \fL\s-1make install\fR\s+1, these clients can be
run as described below.
If you have not done a \fL\s-1make install\fR\s+1, you need to set
the environment variable \s-1PEXAPIDIR\s+1 to the directory where the
support files used by the \s-1PEX-API\s+1 are located.

\fIauto_box\fR is a simple program that displays four views of a rotating cube.
It initially displays the cube with filled polygons, then with hollow polygons, or
polylines.
Four views of the cube are presented in four quadrants, each with a different rotation
applied.  In the first and fourth quadrants the back faces and front faces are
respectively culled out, demonstrating one of the \s-1PHIGS PLUS\s+1 features.
\fIauto_box\fR uses only \s-1PHIGS\s+1 indexed colours.
To run the program move to the directory \fL\s-1mit/demos/auto_box\fR\s+1 
and type \fL\s-1auto_box\fR\s+1.
It exits after all views and rotations are completed once.

\fIbeach_ball\fR is a simple program that displays a bouncing multicolored
pseudo-sphere (a beach ball).
It uses filled polygons for the faces of the beach ball.
To run the program move to the directory \fL\s-1mit/demos/beach_ball\fR\s+1 
and type \fL\s-1beach_ball\fR\s+1.
You must type \fL\s-1Control-C\fR\s+1 to exit this program, as it will run
in a continuous loop.
.LP
On server implementations that have not been optimized, it may be hard
to visualize the bouncing motion of the ball.
Because \s-1PEX\s+1 requests may be buffered in queues, there may be a delay
between typing \fL\s-1Control-C\fR\s+1 and the client exiting.
