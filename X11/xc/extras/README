This directory (xc/extras) contains packages that are maintained outside
of XFree86, but which are included with the base XFree86 distribution.
Each such package should be imported on its own vendor branch (see
the README.XFree86 file in each subdirectory for specific 'cvs import'
details).  'XFree86' RCS ident lines should only be added to files that
have XFree86-specific changes.  Binary files should not normally be
imported.

Packages included here must be redistributable under conditions compatible
with the XFree86 redistribution conditions (see
xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/doc/COPYRIGHT for examples of compatible
licences).
