#GENERAL NOTES:
#  This file is a normal Perl code, interpreted by Perl itself.
#  - make sure this file (or directory where it resides) is NOT WRITABLE
#    by mere mortals (not even vscan/amavis; best to make it owned by root),
#    otherwise it can represent a severe security risk!
#  - for values which are interpreted as booleans, it is recommended
#    to use 1 for true, and 0 or undef or '' for false;
#    Note that this interpretation of boolean values does not apply directly
#    to LDAP and SQL lookups, which follow their own rules - see README.lookups
#    and README.ldap (in short: use Y/N in SQL, and TRUE/FALSE in LDAP);
#  - Perl syntax applies. Most notably: strings in "" may include variables
#    (which start with $ or @); to include characters $ and @ and \ in double
#    quoted strings precede them by a backslash; in single-quoted strings
#    the $ and @ lose their special meaning, so it is usually easier to use
#    single quoted strings (or qw operator) for e-mail addresses.
#    In both types of quoting a backslash should to be doubled.
#  - variables with names starting with a '@' are lists, the values assigned
#    to them should be lists too, e.g. ('one@foo', $mydomain, "three");
#    note the comma-separation and parenthesis. If strings in the list
#    do not contain spaces nor variables, a Perl operator qw() may be used
#    as a shorthand to split its argument on whitespace and produce a list
#    of strings, e.g. qw( one@foo example.com three );  Note that the argument
#    to qw is quoted implicitly and no variable interpretation is done within
#    (no '$' variable evaluations). The #-initiated comments can NOT be used
#    within a string. In other words, $ and # lose their special meaning
#    within a qw argument, just like within '...' strings.
#  - all e-mail addresses in this file and as used internally by the daemon
#    are in their raw (rfc2821-unquoted and non-bracketed) form, i.e.
#    Bob "Funny" Dude@example.com, not: "Bob \"Funny\" Dude"@example.com
#    and not <"Bob \"Funny\" Dude"@example.com>; also: '' and not '<>'.
#  - the term 'default value' in examples below refers to the value of a
#    variable pre-assigned to it by the program; any explicit assignment
#    to a variable in this configuration file overrides the default value;


#
# Section I - Essential daemon and MTA settings
#

# $MYHOME serves as a quick default for some other configuration settings.
# More refined control is available with each individual setting further down.
# $MYHOME is not used directly by the program. No trailing slash!
#$MYHOME = '/var/lib/amavis';   # (default is '/var/amavis'), -H

# $mydomain serves as a quick default for some other configuration settings.
# More refined control is available with each individual setting further down.
# $mydomain is never used directly by the program.
$mydomain = 'example.com';      # (no useful default)

# $myhostname = 'host.example.com';  # fqdn of this host, default by uname(3)

# Set the user and group to which the daemon will change if started as root
# (otherwise just keeps the UID unchanged, and these settings have no effect):
$daemon_user  = 'vscan';   # (no default;  customary: vscan or amavis), -u
$daemon_group = 'vscan';   # (no default;  customary: vscan or amavis), -g

# Runtime working directory (cwd), and a place where
# temporary directories for unpacking mail are created.
# (no trailing slash, may be a scratch file system)
$TEMPBASE = $MYHOME;	        # (must be set if other config vars use is), -T
#$TEMPBASE = "$MYHOME/tmp";     # prefer to keep home dir /var/amavis clean?

#$db_home = "$MYHOME/db";    # DB databases directory, default "$MYHOME/db", -D

# $helpers_home sets environment variable HOME, and is passed as option
# 'home_dir_for_helpers' to Mail::SpamAssassin::new. It should be a directory
# on a normal persistent file system, not a scratch or temporary file system
#$helpers_home = $MYHOME;	# (defaults to $MYHOME), -S

# Run the daemon in the specified chroot jail if nonempty:
#$daemon_chroot_dir = $MYHOME;  # (default is undef, meaning: do not chroot), -R

#$pid_file  = "$MYHOME/amavisd.pid";  # (default is "$MYHOME/amavisd.pid"), -P
#$lock_file = "$MYHOME/amavisd.lock"; # (default is "$MYHOME/amavisd.lock"), -L

# set environment variables if you want (no defaults):
$ENV{TMPDIR} = $TEMPBASE; # used for SA temporary files, by some decoders, etc.

$enable_db = 1;              # enable use of BerkeleyDB/libdb (SNMP and nanny)
$enable_global_cache = 1;    # enable use of libdb-based cache if $enable_db=1

$enable_dkim_verification = 1;  # enable DKIM signatures verification
$enable_dkim_signing = 1;    # load DKIM signing code, keys defined by dkim_key

# MTA SETTINGS, UNCOMMENT AS APPROPRIATE,
# both $forward_method and $notify_method default to 'smtp:[127.0.0.1]:10025'

# POSTFIX, or SENDMAIL in dual-MTA setup, or EXIM V4
# (set host and port number as required; host can be specified
# as an IP address or a DNS name (A or CNAME, but MX is ignored)
#$forward_method = 'smtp:[127.0.0.1]:10025';  # where to forward checked mail
#$notify_method = $forward_method;            # where to submit notifications

#$os_fingerprint_method = 'p0f:127.0.0.1:2345';  # query p0f-analyzer.pl

# To make it possible for several hosts to share one content checking daemon,
# the IP address and/or the port number in $forward_method and $notify_method
# may be spacified as an asterisk. An asterisk in the colon-separated
# second field (host) will be replaced by the SMTP client peer address,
# An asterisk in the third field (tcp port) will be replaced by the incoming
# SMTP/LMTP session port number plus one. This obsoletes the previously used
# less flexible configuration parameter $relayhost_is_client. An example:
#   $forward_method = 'smtp:*:*'; $notify_method = 'smtp:*:10587';


# NOTE: The defaults (above) are good for Postfix or dual-sendmail. You MUST
#       uncomment the appropriate settings below if using other setups!

# SENDMAIL MILTER, using amavis-milter.c helper program:
#$forward_method = undef;  # no explicit forwarding, sendmail does it by itself
# milter; option -odd is needed to avoid deadlocks
#$notify_method = 'pipe:flags=q argv=/usr/sbin/sendmail -Ac -i -odd -f ${sender} -- ${recipient}';
# just a thought: can we use use -Am instead of -odd ?

# SENDMAIL (old non-milter setup, as relay, deprecated):
#$forward_method = 'pipe:flags=q argv=/usr/sbin/sendmail -C/etc/sendmail.orig.cf -i -f ${sender} -- ${recipient}';
#$notify_method = $forward_method;

# SENDMAIL (old non-milter setup, amavis.c calls local delivery agent, deprecated):
#$forward_method = undef;  # no explicit forwarding, amavis.c will call LDA
#$notify_method = 'pipe:flags=q argv=/usr/sbin/sendmail -Ac -i -f ${sender} -- ${recipient}';

# EXIM v3 (not recommended with v4 or later, which can use SMTP setup instead):
#$forward_method = 'pipe:flags=q argv=/usr/sbin/exim -oMr scanned-ok -i -f ${sender} -- ${recipient}';
#$notify_method = $forward_method;

# prefer to collect mail for forwarding as BSMTP files?
#$forward_method = "bsmtp:$MYHOME/out-%i-%n.bsmtp";
#$notify_method = $forward_method;


# Net::Server pre-forking settings
# The $max_servers should match the width of your MTA pipe
# feeding amavisd, e.g. with Postfix the 'Max procs' field in the
# master.cf file, like the '2' in the:  smtp-amavis unix - - n - 2 smtp
#
$max_servers = 2;     # num of pre-forked children (2..30 is common), -m
$max_requests = 20;   # retire a child after that many accepts (default 20)

$child_timeout=5*60;  # abort child if it does not complete its processing in
                      # approximately n seconds (default: 8*60 seconds)

$smtpd_timeout = 120; # disconnect session if client is idle for too long
                      # (default: 8*60 seconds); should be higher than a
                      # Postfix setting max_idle (default 100s)

# Here is a QUICK WAY to completely DISABLE some sections of code
# that WE DO NOT WANT (it won't even be compiled-in).
# For more refined controls leave the following two lines commented out,
# and see further down what these two lookup lists really mean.
#
# @bypass_virus_checks_maps = (1);  # controls running of anti-virus code
# @bypass_spam_checks_maps  = (1);  # controls running of anti-spam code
# $bypass_decode_parts = 1;         # controls running of decoders&dearchivers
#
# Any setting can be changed with a new assignment, so make sure
# you do not unintentionally override these settings further down!

# Check also the settings of @av_scanners at the end if you want to use
# virus scanners. If not, you may want to delete the whole long assignment
# to the variable @av_scanners and @av_scanners_backup, which will also
# remove the virus checking code (e.g. if you only want to do spam scanning).


# Lookup list of local domains (see README.lookups for syntax details)
#
# @local_domains_maps is a list of lookup tables which are used in deciding
# whether a recipient is local or not, or in other words, if the message is
# outgoing or not. This affects inserting spam-related and OS fingerprinting
# header fields for local recipients, editing Subject header field and allowing
# mail body defanging, limiting recipient notifications to local recipients,
# in deciding if address extension may be appended, in matching mail addresses
# to non-fqdn SQL record keys, for proper operation of pen pals feature,
# for selecting statistics counters (distinguishing outgoing from internal-
# to internal mail), and possibly more in future versions.
# Set it up correctly if you need features that rely on this setting.
#
# With Postfix (2.0) a quick hint on what local domains normally are:
# a union of domains specified in: mydestination, virtual_alias_domains,
# virtual_mailbox_domains, and relay_domains.

@local_domains_maps = ( [".$mydomain"] );  # $mydomain and its subdomains
# @local_domains_maps = (); # default is empty list, no recip. considered local
# @local_domains_maps =  # using ACL lookup table
#   ( [ ".$mydomain", 'sub.example.net', '.example.com' ] );
# @local_domains_maps =  # similar, split list elements on whitespace
#   ( [qw( .example.com !host.sub.example.net .sub.example.net )] );
# @local_domains_maps = ( new_RE( qr'[@.]example\.com$'i ) );   # using regexp
# @local_domains_maps = ( read_hash("$MYHOME/local_domains") ); # using hash
#   perhaps combined with Postfix: mydestination = /var/amavis/local_domains
# for debugging purposes: dump_hash($local_domains_maps[0]);
#
# Section II - MTA specific (defaults should be ok)
#

#$insert_received_line = 1;       # behave like MTA: insert 'Received:' header
			          # (does not apply to sendmail/milter)
			          # (default is true)

# AMAVIS-CLIENT PROTOCOL INPUT SETTINGS (e.g. with amavisd-release, or
#   sendmail milter through helper clients like amavis-milter.c and amavis.c)
#   option(s) -p overrides $inet_socket_port and $unix_socketname
$unix_socketname = "$MYHOME/amavisd.sock"; # amavis helper protocol socket
#$unix_socketname = undef;        # disable listening on a unix socket
                                  # (default is undef, i.e. disabled)
                                  # (usual setting is $MYHOME/amavisd.sock)

# SMTP SERVER (INPUT) PROTOCOL SETTINGS (e.g. with Postfix, Exim v4, ...)
#   (used when MTA is configured to pass mail to amavisd via SMTP or LMTP)
$inet_socket_port = 10024;        # accept SMTP on this local TCP port
                                  # (default is undef, i.e. disabled)
# multiple ports may be provided: $inet_socket_port = [10024, 10026, 10028];

# SMTP SERVER (INPUT) access control
# - do not allow free access to the amavisd SMTP port !!!
#
# when MTA is at the same host, use the following (one or the other or both):
#$inet_socket_bind = '127.0.0.1'; # limit socket bind to loopback interface
                                  # (default is '127.0.0.1')
@inet_acl = qw(127.0.0.1 [::1]);  # allow SMTP access only from localhost IP
                                  # (default is qw(127.0.0.1 [::1]) )

# when MTA (one or more) is on a different host, use the following:
#@inet_acl = qw(127.0.0.0/8 [::1] 10.1.0.1 10.1.0.2);  # adjust list as needed
#$inet_socket_bind = undef;       # bind to all IP interfaces if undef

#
# Example1:
# @inet_acl = qw( 127/8 10/8 172.16/12 192.168/16 );
# permit only SMTP access from loopback and rfc1918 private address space
#
# Example2:
# @inet_acl = qw( !192.168.1.12 172.16.3.3 !172.16.3/255.255.255.0
#		  127.0.0.1 10/8 172.16/12 192.168/16 );
# matches loopback and rfc1918 private address space except host 192.168.1.12
# and net 172.16.3/24 (but host 172.16.3.3 within 172.16.3/24 still matches)
#
# Example3:
# @inet_acl = qw( 127/8
#		  !172.16.3.0   !172.16.3.127 172.16.3.0/25
#		  !172.16.3.128 !172.16.3.255 172.16.3.128/25 );
# matches loopback and both halves of the 172.16.3/24 C-class,
# split into two subnets, except all four broadcast addresses
# for these subnets


# @mynetworks is an IP access list which determines if the original SMTP client
# IP address belongs to our internal networks, i.e. mail is coming from inside.
# It is much like the Postfix parameter 'mynetworks' in semantics and similar
# in syntax, and its value should normally match the Postfix counterpart.
# It only affects the value of a macro %l (=sender-is-local),
# and the loading of policy 'MYNETS' if present (see below).
# Note that '-o smtp_send_xforward_command=yes' (or its lmtp counterpart)
# must be enabled in the Postfix service that feeds amavisd, otherwise
# client IP address is not available to amavisd-new.
#
# @mynetworks = qw( 127.0.0.0/8 [::1] [FE80::]/10 [FEC0::]/10
#                   10.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/12 192.168.0.0/16 );  # default
#
# A list of networks can also be read from a file, either as an IP acl in
# CIDR notation, one address per line (comments and empty lines are allowed):
#   @mynetworks_maps = (read_array('/etc/amavisd-mynetworks'), \@mynetworks);
#
# or less flexibly (but provides faster lookups for large lists) by reading
# into a hash lookup table, which only allows for full addresses or classful
# IPv4 subnets with truncated octets, such as 127, 10, 192.168, 10.11.12.13,
# one address per line (comments and empty lines are allowed):
#   @mynetworks_maps = (read_hash('/etc/amavisd-mynetworks'), \@mynetworks);

# See README.lookups for details on specifying access control lists.


#
# Section III - Logging
#

# true (e.g. 1) => syslog;  false (e.g. 0) => logging to file
$DO_SYSLOG = 1;                   # (defaults to 0)

# Section IV - Notifications/DSN, bounce/reject/discard/pass, quarantine
#

# Select notifications text encoding when Unicode-aware Perl is converting
# text from internal character representation to external encoding (charset
# in MIME terminology). Used as argument to Perl Encode::encode subroutine.
#
#   to be used in RFC 2047-encoded header field bodies, e.g. in Subject:
#$hdr_encoding = 'iso-8859-1';  # MIME charset (default: 'iso-8859-1')
#$hdr_encoding_qb = 'Q';        # MIME encoding: quoted-printable (default)
#$hdr_encoding_qb = 'B';        # MIME encoding: base64
#
#   to be used in notification body text: its encoding and Content-type.charset
#$bdy_encoding = 'iso-8859-1';  # (default: 'iso-8859-1')

# Default template texts for notifications may be overruled by directly
# assigning new text to template variables, or by reading template text
# from files. A second argument may be specified in a call to read_text(),
# specifying character encoding layer to be used when reading from the
# external file, e.g. 'utf8', 'iso-8859-1', or often just $bdy_encoding.
# Text will be converted to internal character representation by Perl 5.8.0
# or later; second argument is ignored otherwise. See PerlIO::encoding,
# Encode::PerlIO and perluniintro man pages.
#
# $notify_sender_templ      = read_text("$MYHOME/notify_sender.txt");

# If notification template files are collectively available in some directory,
# one may call read_l10n_templates which invokes read_text for each known
# template. This is primarily a Debian-specific feature, but was incorporated
# into base code to facilitate porting.
#
#   read_l10n_templates('/etc/amavis/en_US');
#
# If read_l10n_templates is called, a localization template directory must
# contain the following files:

#                                 of the character set used in the template
#                                 files (e.g. utf8, iso-8859-2, ...) and is

# Here is an overall picture (sequence of events) of how pieces fit together
#
#   bypass_virus_checks set for all recipients? ==> PASS
#   no viruses?   ==> PASS
#   log virus     if $log_templ is nonempty
#   quarantine    if $virus_quarantine_to is nonempty
#   notify admin  if $virus_admin (lookup) nonempty
#   notify recips if $warnvirusrecip and (recipient is local or $warn_offsite)
#   add address extensions for local recipients (when enabled)
#   send (non-)delivery notifications
#      to sender if DSN needed (BOUNCE or ($warnvirussender and D_PASS))
#   virus_lovers or final_destiny==D_PASS  ==> PASS
#   DISCARD (2xx) or REJECT (5xx) (depending on final_*_destiny)
#
# Equivalent flow diagram applies for spam checks.
# If a virus is detected, spam checking is skipped entirely.

# The following symbolic constants can be used in *_destiny settings:
#
# D_PASS     mail will pass to recipients, regardless of bad contents;
#
# D_DISCARD  mail will not be delivered to its recipients, sender will NOT be
#            notified. Effectively we lose mail (but will be quarantined
#            unless disabled). Losing mail is not decent for a mailer,
#            but might be desired.
#
# D_BOUNCE   mail will not be delivered to its recipients, a non-delivery
#            notification (bounce) will be sent to the sender by amavisd-new;
#            Exception: bounce (DSN) will not be sent if a virus name matches
#            @viruses_that_fake_sender_maps, or to messages from mailing lists
#            (Precedence: bulk|list|junk), or for spam level that exceeds
#            the $sa_dsn_cutoff_level.
#
# D_REJECT   mail will not be delivered to its recipients, sender should
#            preferably get a reject, e.g. SMTP permanent reject response
#            (e.g. with milter), or non-delivery notification from MTA
#            (e.g. Postfix). If this is not possible (e.g. different recipients
#            have different tolerances to bad mail contents and not using LMTP)
#            amavisd-new sends a bounce by itself (same as D_BOUNCE).
#            Not to be used with Postfix or dual-MTA setups!
#
# Notes:
#   D_REJECT and D_BOUNCE are similar, the difference is in who is responsible
#            for informing the sender about non-delivery, and how informative
#            the notification can be (amavisd-new knows more than MTA);
#   With D_REJECT, MTA may reject original SMTP, or send DSN (delivery status
#            notification, colloquially called 'bounce') - depending on MTA;
#            Best suited for sendmail milter and Courier, especially for spam.
#   With D_BOUNCE, amavisd-new (not MTA) sends DSN (can better explain the
#            reason for mail non-delivery or even suppress DSN, but unable
#            to reject the original SMTP session). Best suited to reporting
#            viruses, and for Postfix and other dual-MTA setups, which can't
#            reject original client SMTP session, as the mail has already
#            been enqueued.

# Alternatives to consider for spam:
# - use D_PASS if clients will do filtering based on inserted
#   mail headers or added address extensions ('plus-addressing');
# - use D_DISCARD, if kill_level is set comfortably high;
#
# D_BOUNCE is preferred for viruses, but consider:
# - use D_PASS (or virus_lovers) to deliver viruses;
# - use D_REJECT instead of D_BOUNCE if using Courier or milter and under heavy
#   virus storm;

#
# The value of scalar $virus_quarantine_to/$spam_quarantine_to (or a
# per-recipient lookup result from lookup tables @virus_quarantine_to_maps)
# is/are interpreted as follows:
#
# VARIANT 1:
#   empty or undef disables quarantine;
#
# VARIANT 2:
#   a string NOT containing an '@';
# amavisd will behave as a local delivery agent (LDA) and will quarantine
# viruses to local files according to hash %local_delivery_aliases (pseudo
# aliases map) - see subroutine mail_to_local_mailbox() for details.
# Some of the predefined aliases are 'virus-quarantine' and 'spam-quarantine'.
# Setting $virus_quarantine_to ($spam_quarantine_to) to this string will:
#
# * if $QUARANTINEDIR is a directory, each quarantined virus will go
#   to a separate file in the $QUARANTINEDIR directory (traditional
#   amavis style, similar to maildir mailbox format);
#
# * otherwise $QUARANTINEDIR is treated as a file name of a Unix-style
#   mailbox. All quarantined messages will be appended to this file.
#   Amavisd child process must obtain an exclusive lock on the file during
#   delivery, so this may be less efficient than using individual files
#   or forwarding to MTA, and it may not work across NFS or other non-local
#   file systems (but may be handy for pickup of quarantined files via IMAP
#   for example);
#
# VARIANT 3:
#   any email address (must contain '@').
# The e-mail messages to be quarantined will be handed to MTA
# for delivery to the specified address. If a recipient address local to MTA
# is desired, you may leave the domain part empty, e.g. 'infected@', but the
# '@' character must nevertheless be included to distinguish it from variant 2.
#
# This variant enables more refined delivery control made available by MTA
# (e.g. its aliases file, other local delivery agents, dealing with
# privileges and file locking when delivering to user's mailbox, nonlocal
# delivery and forwarding, fan-out lists). Make sure the mail-to-be-quarantined
# will not be handed back to amavisd for checking, as this will cause a loop
# (hopefully broken at some stage)! If this can be assured, notifications
# will benefit too from not being unnecessarily virus-scanned.
#
# By default this is safe to do with Postfix and Exim v4 and dual-sendmail
# setup, but probably not safe with sendmail milter interface without tricks.

# A little trick: a pattern qr'\.exe$' matches both a short type name '.exe',
# as well as any file name which happens to end with .exe. If only matching
# a file name is desired, but not the short type, a pattern qr'.\.exe$'i
# or similar may be used, which requires that at least one character precedes
# the '.exe', and so it will never match short file types which always start
# with a dot.

# Section V - Per-recipient and per-sender handling, whitelisting, etc.
#

# @virus_lovers_maps list of lookup tables:
#   (this should be considered a policy option, is does not disable checks,
#   see bypass*checks for that!)
#
# Exclude certain RECIPIENTS from virus filtering by adding their (lower-cased)
# envelope e-mail address (or domain only) to one of the lookup tables in
# the @virus_lovers_maps list - see README.lookups and examples.
# Make sure the appropriate form (e.g. external/internal) of address
# is used in case of virtual domains, or when mapping external to internal
# addresses, etc. - this is MTA-specific.
#
# Notifications would still be generated however (see the overall
# picture above), and infected mail (if passed) gets additional header:
#   X-AMaViS-Alert: INFECTED, message contains virus: ...
# (header not inserted with Courier or milter interface!)
#
# Setting $final_*_destiny=D_PASS is functionally equivalent to having
# all recipients match the @*_lovers_maps.
#
# NOTE (milter interface only): in case of multiple recipients,
# it is only possible to drop or accept the message in its entirety - for all
# recipients. If all of them are virus lovers, we'll accept mail, but if
# at least one recipient is not a virus lover, we'll discard the message.


# @bypass_virus_checks_maps list of lookup tables:
#   (this is mainly a time-saving option, unlike virus_lovers* !)
#
# Similar in concept to @virus_lovers_maps, a @bypass_virus_checks_maps
# is used to skip entirely the decoding, unpacking and virus checking,
# but only if ALL recipients match the lookup.
#
# @bypass_virus_checks_maps does NOT GUARANTEE the message will NOT be checked
# for viruses - this may still happen when there is more than one recipient
# for a message and not all of them match these lookup tables, or when
# check result was cached (i.e. the same contents was recently sent to other
# recipients). To guarantee virus delivery, a recipient must also match
# @virus_lovers_maps lookups (but see milter limitations above),
#
# The following table summarizes the possible combinations:
# bypass lover
#   0      0    useful, check for malware and block it
#   0      1    useful, check but deliver nevertheless, possibly tagged
#   1      0    not too useful, free riding on cached or other-people's checks
#   1      1    useful, no checks if possible, and no effects

# NOTE: it would not be clever to base enabling of virus checks on SENDER
# address, since there are no guarantees that it is genuine. Many viruses
# and spam messages fake sender address. To achieve selective filtering
# based on the source of the mail (e.g. IP address, MTA port number, ...),
# use mechanisms provided by MTA if available, possibly combined with policy
# banks feature.

# Similar to lists of lookup tables controlling virus checking, there are
# counterparts for spam scanning, banned names/types, and headers_checks
# control:
#   @spam_lovers_maps,
#   @banned_files_lovers_maps,
#   @bad_header_lovers_maps
# and:
#   @bypass_spam_checks_maps,
#   @bypass_banned_checks_maps,
#   @bypass_header_checks_maps

# Example:
#   @bypass_header_checks_maps = ( [qw( user@example.com )] );
#   @bad_header_lovers_maps    = ( [qw( user@example.com )] );

# The following example disables spam checking altogether,
# since it matches any recipient e-mail address.
#   @bypass_spam_checks_maps = (1);


# See README.lookups for further detail, and examples below.

# In the following example a list of lookup tables @virus_lovers_maps
# contains three elements, the first is a reference to an ACL lookup table
# (brackets in Perl indicate a ref to a list), the second is a reference
# to a hash lookup table (curly braces in Perl indicate a ref to a hash),
# the third is a regexp lookup table, indicated by the type of object
# created by new_RE() :
#
#@virus_lovers_maps = (
# [ qw( me@lab.xxx.com !lab.xxx.com .xxx.com yyy.org ) ],
# { "postmaster\@$mydomain" => 1, # double quotes permit variable evaluation
#   'postmaster@example.com'=> 1, # in single quotes the '@' need not be quoted
#   'abuse@example.com'=> 1,
#   'some.user@'       => 1,  # this recipient, regardless of domain
#   'boss@example.com' => 0,  # never, even if domain matches
#   'example.com'      => 1,  # this domain, but not its subdomains
#   '.example.com'     => 1,  # this domain, including its subdomains
# },
# new_RE( qr'^(helpdesk|postmaster)@example\.com$'i ),
#);

#@spam_lovers_maps = (
# ["postmaster\@$mydomain", 'postmaster@example.com', 'abuse@example.com'],
#);

#@bad_header_lovers_maps = (
# ["postmaster\@", "abuse\@$mydomain"],
#);


# as an alternative to fiddling with @_lovers_maps and similar _maps, here
# is an illustration of using a more general *_by_ccat associative array,
# introduced with 2.4.0, like %lovers_maps_by_ccat in this example:
#
#$lovers_maps_by_ccat{+CC_SPAM} = [
#  read_hash("$MYHOME/etc/spam_lovers.txt"),
#  [qw(postmaster@example.com abuse@example.com)],
#];
#
#$lovers_maps_by_ccat{+CC_BANNED} = [
#  { map {lc $_ => 1}    # construct a hash lookup table from a list
#        qw(user1@example.com user2.example.com)
#  },
#];


# to save some typing of quotes and commas, a Perl operator qw can be used
# to split its argument on whitespace and to quote resulting elements:
#@bypass_spam_checks_maps = (
#  [ qw( some.ddd !butnot.example.com .example.com ) ],
#);


# don't run spam check for these RECIPIENT domains:
#   @bypass_spam_checks_maps = ( [qw( d1.com .d2.com a.d3.com )] );
# or the other way around (bypass check for all BUT these):
#   @bypass_spam_checks_maps = ( [qw( !d1.com !.d2.com !a.d3.com . )] );
# a practical application: don't check outgoing mail for spam:
#   @bypass_spam_checks_maps = ( [ "!.$mydomain", "." ] );
# or calculated (negated) from the %local_domains:
#   @bypass_spam_checks_maps =
#     ( {map {$_ => !$local_domains{$_}} keys %local_domains}, 1);
# (a downside of which is that such mail will not count as ham in SA bayes db)
#
# Note that 'outgoing' is not the same as 'originating from inside'. We refer
# to 'outgoing' here as 'mail addressed to recipients outside our domain(s)'.
# The internal-to-internal mail is not outgoing, but is still originating from
# inside. To base rules on 'originating from inside', the use of a policy bank
# with 'originating => 1' is needed (such as MYNETS), in conjunction with
# XFORWARD Postfix extension to SMTP.

# Where to find SQL server(s) and database to support SQL lookups?
# A list of triples: (dsn,user,passw).   (dsn = data source name)
# More than one entry may be specified for multiple (backup) SQL servers.
# See 'man DBI', 'man DBD::mysql', 'man DBD::Pg', ... for details.
# When chroot-ed, accessing SQL server over inet socket may be more convenient.
#
# @lookup_sql_dsn =
#   ( ['DBI:mysql:database=mail;host=127.0.0.1;port=3306', 'user1', 'passwd1'],
#     ['DBI:mysql:database=mail;host=host2', 'username2', 'password2'],
#     ["DBI:SQLite:dbname=$MYHOME/sql/mail_prefs.sqlite", '', ''] );
# @storage_sql_dsn = @lookup_sql_dsn;  # none, same, or separate database
#
# ('mail' in the example is the database name, choose what you like)
# With PostgreSQL the dsn (first element of the triple) may look like:
#      'DBI:Pg:dbname=mail;host=host1'

# The SQL select clause to fetch per-recipient policy settings.
# The %k will be replaced by a comma-separated list of query addresses
# for a recipient (e.g. a full address, domain only, catchall), %a will be
# replaced by an exact recipient address (same as the first entry in %k,
# suitable for pattern matching). Use ORDER, if there is a chance that
# multiple records will match - the first match wins (i.e. the first
# returned record). If field names are not unique (e.g. 'id'), the later
# field overwrites the earlier in a hash returned by lookup, which is why
# we use 'users.*, policy.*, users.id', i.e. the id is repeated at the end.
# This is a legacy variable for upwards compatibility, now only referenced
# by the program through a %sql_clause entry 'sel_policy' - newer config
# files may assign directly to $sql_clause{'sel_policy'} if preferred.
# No need to uncomment the following assignment if the default is ok.
#   $sql_select_policy = 'SELECT *,users.id FROM users,policy'.
#     ' WHERE (users.policy_id=policy.id) AND (users.email IN (%k))'.
#     ' ORDER BY users.priority DESC';
#
# The SQL select clause to check sender in per-recipient whitelist/blacklist.
# The first SELECT argument '?' will be users.id from recipient SQL lookup,
# the %k will be a sender addresses (e.g. a full address, a domain only, a
# catchall), the %a will be an exact sender address (same as the first entry
# in %k). Only the first occurrence of '?' will be replaced by users.id,
# subsequent occurrences of '?' will see empty string as an argument.
# There can be zero or more occurrences of %k or %a, lookup keys will be
# replicated accordingly. This is a separate legacy variable for upwards
# compatibility, now only referenced by the program through %sql_clause
# entry 'sel_wblist' - newer config files may assign directly to
# $sql_clause{'sel_wblist'} if preferred. The default value is:
#   $sql_select_white_black_list = 'SELECT wb FROM wblist,mailaddr'.
#     ' WHERE (wblist.rid=?) AND (wblist.sid=mailaddr.id)'.
#     '   AND (mailaddr.email IN (%k))'.
#     ' ORDER BY mailaddr.priority DESC';
#
# To disable SQL white/black list, set to undef (otherwise comment-out
# the following statement, leaving it at the default value):
$sql_select_white_black_list = undef;  # undef disables SQL white/blacklisting

# Controls the format of timestamps in the field msgs.time_iso:
# $timestamp_fmt_mysql = 1; # if using MySQL *and* msgs.time_iso is TIMESTAMP;
#   defaults to 0, which is good for non-MySQL or if msgs.time_iso is CHAR(16)

# Does a database mail address field with no '@' character represent a
# local username or a domain name?  By default it implies a username in
# SQL and LDAP lookups (but represents a domain in hash and acl lookups),
# so domain names in SQL and LDAP should be specified as '@domain'.
# Setting these to true will cause 'xxx' to be interpreted as a domain
# name, just like in hash or acl lookups.
#
# $sql_lookups_no_at_means_domain  = 0;  # default is 0
# $ldap_lookups_no_at_means_domain = 0;  # default is 0

# Here is an example of a SELECT clause that fabricates an artificial 'users'
# table from actual table 'postfix_domains' containing a field 'domain_name'.
# The effect is that domains listed in the 'postfix_domains' table will be
# treated as local by amavisd, and be given settings from a policy id 99
# if such a policy id exists, or just fall back to static lookups.
# The user.id (with a value 1) is there only to provide a user id (same id
# for all listed domains) when global SQL-based white/blacklisting is used.
#
# $sql_lookups_no_at_means_domain = 1;
# $sql_select_policy =
#   'SELECT *, user.id'.
#   ' FROM (SELECT 1 as id, 99 as policy_id, "Y" AS local'.

#   ' LEFT JOIN policy ON policy_id=policy.id';

# If passing malware to certain recipients ($final_*_destiny=D_PASS or
# *_lovers), the recipient-based lookup tables @addr_extension_*_maps may
# return a string, which (if nonempty) will be added as an address extension
# to the local-part of the recipient's address. This extension may be used
# by the final local delivery agent (LDA) to place such mail into different
# subfolders (the extension is usually interpreted as a folder name).
# This is sometimes known as the 'plus addressing'. Appending address
# extensions is prevented when:
# - recipient does not match lookup tables @local_domains_maps;
# - lookup into corresponding @addr_extension_*_maps results
#   in an empty string or undef;
# - $recipient_delimiter is empty (see below)
# LDAs usually default to stripping away address extension if no special
# handling is specified or if a named subfolder or alias does not exist,
# so adding address extensions normally does no harm.

# @addr_extension_virus_maps  = ('virus');     # defaults to empty
# @addr_extension_spam_maps   = ('spam');      # defaults to empty
# @addr_extension_banned_maps = ('banned');    # defaults to empty
# @addr_extension_bad_header_maps = ('badh');  # defaults to empty

# A more complex example:
# @addr_extension_virus_maps = (
#   {'sub.example.com'=>'infected', '.example.com'=>'filtered'}, 'virus' );

# Delimiter between local part of the envelope recipient address and address
# extension (which can optionally be added, see @addr_extension_*_maps. E.g.
# recipient address <user@example.com> is changed to <user+virus@example.com>.
#
# Delimiter must match the equivalent (final) MTA delimiter setting.
# (e.g. for Postfix add 'recipient_delimiter = +' to main.cf)
# Setting it to an empty string or to undef disables adding extensions
# regardless of $addr_extension_*_maps.

# ENVELOPE SENDER SOFT-WHITELISTING / SOFT-BLACKLISTING

# Instead of hard black- or whitelisting, a softer approach is to add
# score points (penalties) to the SA score for mail from certain senders.
# Positive points lean towards blacklisting, negative towards whitelisting.
# This is much like adding SA rules or using its white/blacklisting, except
# that here only envelope sender addresses are considered (not addresses
# in a mail header), and that score points can be assigned per-recipient
# (or globally), and the assigned penalties are customarily much lower
# than the default SA white/blacklisting score.
#
# The table structure is similar to $per_recip_blacklist_sender_lookup_tables
# i.e. the first level key is recipient, pointing to by-sender lookup tables.
# The essential difference is that scores from _all_ matching by-recipient
# lookups (not just the first that matches) are summed to give the final
# score boost. That means that both the site and domain administrators,
# as well as the recipient can have a say on the final score.
#

# ENVELOPE SENDER WHITELISTING / BLACKLISTING  - GLOBAL (RECIPIENT-INDEPENDENT)
# (affects spam checking only, has no effect on virus and other checks)

# WHITELISTING: use ENVELOPE SENDER lookups to ENSURE DELIVERY from whitelisted
# senders even if the message would be recognized as spam. Effectively, for
# the specified senders, message recipients temporarily become 'spam_lovers'.
# To avoid surprises, whitelisted sender also suppresses inserting/editing
# the tag2-level header fields (X-Spam-*, Subject), appending spam address
# extension, and quarantining.
#
# BLACKLISTING: messages from specified SENDERS are DECLARED SPAM.
# Effectively, for messages from blacklisted envelope sender addresses, spam
# level is artificially pushed high, and the normal spam processing applies,
# resulting in 'X-Spam-Flag: YES', high 'X-Spam-Level' bar and other usual
# reactions to spam, including possible rejection. If the message nevertheless
# still passes (e.g. for spam loving recipients), it is tagged as BLACKLISTED
# in the 'X-Spam-Status' header field, but the reported spam value and
# set of tests in this report header field (if available from SpamAssassin,
# which may or may not have been called) is not adjusted.
#
# A sender may be both white- and blacklisted at the same time, settings
# are independent. For example, being both white- and blacklisted, message
# is delivered to recipients, but is not tagged as spam (X-Spam-Flag: No;
# X-Spam-Status: No, ...), but the reported spam level (if computed) may
# still indicate high spam score.
#
# If ALL recipients of the message either white- or blacklist the sender,
# spam scanning (calling the SpamAssassin) is bypassed, saving on time.
#
# The following variables (lists of lookup tables) are available,
# with the semantics and syntax as specified in README.lookups:
# @whitelist_sender_maps, @blacklist_sender_maps

# SOME EXAMPLES:
#
#ACL:
# @whitelist_sender_maps = ( ['.example.org', '.example.net'] );
# @whitelist_sender_maps = ( [qw(.example.org  .example.net)] );  # same thing
#
# @whitelist_sender_maps = ( [".$mydomain"] );  # $mydomain and its subdomains
# NOTE: This is not a reliable way of turning off spam checks for
#   locally-originating mail, as sender address can easily be faked.
#   To reliably avoid spam-scanning outgoing mail, use @bypass_spam_checks_maps
#   for nonlocal recipients. To reliably avoid spam scanning for locally
#   originating mail (including internal-to-internal mail), recognized by
#   the original SMTP client IP address matching @mynetworks, use policy bank
#   MYNETS, adjust @mynetworks, and turn on XFORWARD in the Postfix smtp client
#   service feeding amavisd.

#with regexps:
# @whitelist_sender_maps = ( new_RE(
#   qr'^postmaster@.*\bexample\.com$'i,
#   qr'^owner-[^@]*@'i,  qr'-request@'i,
#   qr'\.example\.com$'i
# ));


# illustrates the use of regexp lookup table:

@blacklist_sender_maps = ( new_RE(
    qr'^(bulkmail|offers|cheapbenefits|earnmoney|foryou|greatcasino)@'i,
    qr'^(investments|lose_weight_today|market\.alert|money2you|MyGreenCard)@'i,
    qr'^(new\.tld\.registry|opt-out|opt-in|optin|saveonlsmoking2002k)@'i,
    qr'^(specialoffer|specialoffers|stockalert|stopsnoring|wantsome)@'i,
    qr'^(workathome|yesitsfree|your_friend|greatoffers)@'i,
    qr'^(inkjetplanet|marketopt|MakeMoney)\d*@'i,
));


# NOTE: whitelisting is becoming deprecated because sender address is
#       all too often faked; use @score_sender_maps for soft-whitelisting!
#
# Illustrates the use of several lookup tables:
#
# @whitelist_sender_maps = (
#
# # read_hash("$MYHOME/whitelist_sender"),  # a hash table read from a file
#
#   # and another hash lookup table constructed in-line, with keys lowercased:

# ENVELOPE SENDER WHITELISTING / BLACKLISTING - PER-RECIPIENT

# The same semantics as for global white/blacklisting applies, but this
# time each recipient (or its domain, or subdomain, ...) can be given
# an individual lookup table for matching senders. The per-recipient lookups
# take precedence over the global lookups, which serve as a fallback default.

# Specify a two-level lookup table: the key for the outer table is recipient,
# and the result should be an inner lookup table (hash or ACL or RE),
# where the key used will be the sender. (Note that this structure is flatter
# than @score_sender_maps, where the first level result is a ref to a _list_
# of inner lookup tables, not a ref to a single lookup table.)
#
#$per_recip_blacklist_sender_lookup_tables = {
# 'user1@my.example.com'=>new_RE(qr'^(inkjetplanet|marketopt|MakeMoney)\d*@'i),

# Section VI - Resource limits
#

# Sanity limit to the number of allowed recipients per SMTP transaction
# $smtpd_recipient_limit = 1100;  # (default is 1100)

# Resource limits to protect unpackers, decompressors and virus scanners
# against mail bombs (e.g. 42.zip)


# Maximum recursion level for extraction/decoding (0 or undef disables limit)
$MAXLEVELS = 14;		# (default is undef, no limit)

# Maximum number of extracted files (0 or undef disables the limit)
$MAXFILES = 1500;		# (default is undef, no limit)

# For the cumulative total of all decoded mail parts we set max storage size
# to defend against mail bombs. Even though parts may be deleted (replaced
# by decoded text) during decoding, the size they occupied is _not_ returned
# to the quota pool.
#
# Parameters to storage quota formula for unpacking/decoding/decompressing
#   Formula:
#     quota = max($MIN_EXPANSION_QUOTA,
#                 $mail_size*$MIN_EXPANSION_FACTOR,
#                 min($MAX_EXPANSION_QUOTA, $mail_size*$MAX_EXPANSION_FACTOR))
#   In plain words (later condition overrules previous ones):
#     allow MAX_EXPANSION_FACTOR times initial mail size,
#     but not more than MAX_EXPANSION_QUOTA,
#     but not less than MIN_EXPANSION_FACTOR times initial mail size,
#     but never less than MIN_EXPANSION_QUOTA
#
$MIN_EXPANSION_QUOTA =      100*1024;  # bytes  (default undef, not enforced)
$MAX_EXPANSION_QUOTA = 300*1024*1024;  # bytes  (default undef, not enforced)
$MIN_EXPANSION_FACTOR =   5;  # times original mail size  (default is 5)
$MAX_EXPANSION_FACTOR = 500;  # times original mail size  (default is 500)

# expiration time of cached results: time to live in seconds
#   (how long the result of a virus/spam test remains valid)
$virus_check_negative_ttl=  3*60; # time to remember that mail was not infected
$virus_check_positive_ttl= 30*60; # time to remember that mail was infected
$spam_check_negative_ttl = 10*60; # time to remember that mail was not spam
$spam_check_positive_ttl = 30*60; # time to remember that mail was spam
#
# NOTE:
#   Cache size will be determined by the largest of the $*_ttl values.
#   Depending on the mail rate, the cache database may grow quite large.
#   Reasonable compromise for the max value is 15 minutes to 2 hours.

#
# Section VII - External programs, virus scanners
#

# Specify a path string, which is a colon-separated string of directories
# (no trailing slashes!) to be assigned to the environment variable PATH
# and to serve for locating external programs below.

# NOTE: if $daemon_chroot_dir is nonempty, the directories will be
#       relative to the chroot directory specified;

$path = '/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin';

# For external programs specify one string or a search list of strings (first
# match wins). The string (or: each string in a list) may be an absolute path,
# or just a program name, to be located via $path;
# Empty string or undef (=default) disables the use of that external program.
# Optionally command arguments may be specified - only the first substring
# up to the whitespace is used for file searching.

$file   = 'file';   # file(1) utility; use 3.41 or later to avoid vulnerability
$dspam  = 'dspam';

# A list of pairs or n-tuples: [short-type, code_ref, optional-args...].
# Maps short types to a decoding routine, the first match wins.
# Arguments beyond the first two can be program path string (or a listref of
# paths to be searched) or a reference to a variable containing such a path,
# which allows for lazy evaluation, making possible to assign values to
# legacy configuration variables even after the assignment to @decoders.

#     to be looked for in PATH), this may be an array ref of alternative
#     program names or full paths - the first match in the list will be used;
#  2b.alternatively, this second field may be a subroutine reference,
#     and the whole n-tuple entry is passed to it as args; it should return
#     a triple: ($scan_status,$output,$virusnames_ref), where:
#     - $scan_status is: true if a virus was found, 0 if no viruses,
#       undef if scanner was unable to complete its job (failed);

#     - $virusnames_ref is a ref to a list of detected virus names (may be
#       undef or a ref to an empty list);
#  3. command arguments to be given to the scanner program;
#     a substring {} will be replaced by the directory name to be scanned, i.e.
#     "$tempdir/parts", a "*" will be replaced by base file names of parts;
#  4. an array ref of av scanner exit status values, or a regexp (to be
#     matched against scanner output), indicating NO VIRUSES found;
#     a special case is a value undef, which does not claim file to be clean
#     (i.e. it never matches, similar to []), but suppresses a failure warning;
#     to be used when the result is inconclusive (useful for specialized and
#     quick partial scanners such as jpeg checker);
#  5. an array ref of av scanner exit status values, or a regexp (to be
#     matched against scanner output), indicating VIRUSES WERE FOUND;
#     a value undef may be used and it never matches (for consistency with 4.);
#     Note: the virus match prevails over a 'not found' match, so it is safe
#     even if the no. 4. matches for viruses too;
#  6. a regexp (to be matched against scanner output), returning a list
#     of virus names found, or a sub ref, returning such a list when given
#     scanner output as argument;
#  7. and 8.: (optional) subroutines to be executed before and after scanner
#     (e.g. to set environment or current directory);
#     see examples for these at KasperskyLab AVP and NAI uvscan.

# NOTES:
#
# - NOT DEFINING @av_scanners (e.g. setting it to empty list, or deleting the
#   whole assignment) TURNS OFF LOADING AND COMPILING OF THE ANTIVIRUS CODE
#   (which can be handy if all you want to do is spam scanning);
#
# - the order matters: although _all_ available entries from the list
#   are tried regardless of their verdict, scanners are run in the order
#   specified: the report from the first one detecting a virus will be used
#   (providing virus names and scanner output); REARRANGE THE ORDER TO WILL;
#   see also $first_infected_stops_scan;
#
# - it doesn't hurt to keep an unused command line scanner entry in the list
#   if the program can not be found; the path search is only performed once
#   during the program startup;
#
#   COROLLARY: to disable a scanner that _does_ exist on your system,
#   comment out its entry or use undef or '' as its program name/path
#   (second parameter). An example where this is almost a must: disable
#   Sophos 'sweep' if you have its daemonized version Sophie or SAVI-Perl
#   (same for Trophie/vscan, and clamd/clamscan), or if another unrelated
#   program happens to have a name matching one of the entries ('sweep'
#   again comes to mind);
#
# - it DOES HURT to keep unwanted entries which use INTERNAL SUBROUTINES
#   for interfacing (where the second parameter starts with \&).
#   Keeping such entry and not having a corresponding virus scanner daemon
#   causes an unnecessary connection attempt (which eventually times out,
#   but it wastes precious time). For this reason the daemonized entries
#   are commented in the distribution - just remove the '#' where needed.

# Section VIII - Debugging
#

# The most useful debugging tool is to run amavisd-new non-detached
# from a terminal window using command:  # amavisd debug

# Some more refined approaches:

# If sender matches ACL, turn debugging fully up, just for this one message
#@debug_sender_maps = ( ["test-sender\@$mydomain"] );
#@debug_sender_maps = ( [qw( debug@example.com debug@example.net )] );

# May be useful along with @debug_sender_maps:
# Prevent all decoded originals being deleted (replaced by decoded part)
#@keep_decoded_original_maps = (1);

# Turn on SpamAssassin debugging (output to STDERR, use with 'amavisd debug')
#$sa_debug = '1,all';  # defaults to false


#
# Section IX - Policy banks (dynamic policy switching)
#

## Define some policy banks (sets of settings) and give them
## arbitrary names (the names '', 'MYNETS' and 'MYUSERS' have special meaning):
#
# $policy_bank{'ALT'} = {
#   log_level => 3,
#   syslog_ident => 'alt-amavis',
#   syslog_facility => 'LOCAL3',
#   inet_acl => [qw( 10.0.1.14 )],
#   final_spam_destiny => D_PASS, final_bad_header_destiny => D_PASS,
#   forward_method => 'smtp:*:*',
#   notify_method  => 'smtp:[127.0.0.1]:10025',
#   virus_admin_maps => "abuse\@$mydomain",
#   spam_lovers_maps => [@spam_lovers_maps, [qw( abuse@example.com )]],
#   spam_tag_level_maps  => 2.1,
#   spam_tag2_level_maps => 6.32,
#   spam_kill_level_maps => 6.72,
#   spam_dsn_cutoff_level_maps => 8,
#   defang_spam => 1,
#   local_client_bind_address => '10.11.12.13',
#   localhost_name => 'amavis.example.com',
#   smtpd_greeting_banner =>
#     '${helo-name} ${protocol} ${product} ${version-id} (${version-date}) TEST service ready';
#   auth_mech_avail => [qw(PLAIN LOGIN)],
#   auth_required_inp => 1,
#   auth_required_out => 1,
#   amavis_auth_user => 'amavisd', amavis_auth_pass = 'tOpsecretX',

#     ['ClamAV-clamd',
#       \&ask_daemon, ["CONTSCAN {}\n", "/var/run/clamav/clamd"],
#       qr/\bOK$/, qr/\bFOUND$/,

#       qr/^.*?: (?!Infected Archive)(.*) FOUND$/,
#     ],
#   ],
# };

# NOTE: the use of policy banks for changing protocol on the input socket is
# only needed when different protocols need to be spoken on different sockets
# at the same time. For normal use just set globally e.g.: $protocol='AM.PDP';
#
#$policy_bank{'AM.PDP-SOCK'} = {
#  protocol => 'AM.PDP',  # Amavis policy delegation protocol
#  auth_required_release => 0,  # do not require secret_id for amavisd-release
#};
#
#$policy_bank{'AM.PDP-INET'} = {
#  protocol => 'AM.PDP',  # Amavis policy delegation protocol
#  inet_acl => [qw( 127.0.0.1 [::1] )],  # restrict to these IP addresses
#};
#
## the name 'MYNETS' has special semantics: this policy bank gets loaded
## whenever MTA supplies the original SMTP client IP address (Postfix XFORWARD
## extension or a new AM.PDP protocol) and that address matches @mynetworks.
#
# $terminate_dsn_on_notify_success = 1;
# $policy_bank{'MYNETS'} = {  # mail originating from @mynetworks
#   originating => 1,  # is true in MYNETS by deflt, but let's make it explicit
#   terminate_dsn_on_notify_success => 0,
#   spam_kill_level_maps => 6.9,
#   syslog_facility => 'LOCAL4',  # tell syslog to log to a separate file
#   virus_admin_maps => ["virusalert\@$mydomain"], # alert of internal viruses
#   spam_admin_maps  => ["spamalert\@$mydomain"],  # alert of internal spam
#   bypass_spam_checks_maps   => [1],  # or: don't spam-check internal mail
#   bypass_banned_checks_maps => [1],  # don't banned-check internal mail
#   warnbadhsender => 1,  # warn local senders about their broken MUA
#   banned_filename_maps => ['MYNETS-DEFAULT'], # more permissive banning rules
#   spam_quarantine_cutoff_level_maps => undef, # quarantine all local spam
#   spam_dsn_cutoff_level_maps => undef,  # ensure NDN regardless of spam level
#   spam_dsn_cutoff_level_bysender_maps => # but only from local domain senders
#     [ { lc(".$mydomain") => undef,  '.' => 15 } ],
# };

## the name 'MYUSERS' has special semantics: this policy bank gets loaded
## whenever the sender matches @local_domains_maps. This only makes sense
## if local sender addresses can be trusted -- for example by requiring
## authentication before letting users send with their local address.
#
# $policy_bank{'MYUSERS'} = {
#   final_virus_destiny => D_BOUNCE, # bounce only to authenticated local users
#   final_banned_destiny=> D_BOUNCE,
# };


## Now we can assign policy banks to amavisd tcp port numbers listed in
## $inet_socket_port. Whenever the connection from MTA is received, first
## a built-in policy bank $policy_bank{''} gets loaded, which bringings-in
## all the global/legacy settings, then it gets overlaid by the bank
## named in the $interface_policy{$port} if any, and finally the bank
## 'MYNETS' is overlaid if it exists and the SMTP client IP address
## is known (by XFORWARD command from MTA) and it matches @mynetworks.

# $interface_policy{'10026'} = 'ALT';

# used by amavisd-release utility of a new AM.PDP-based amavis-milter client
#$interface_policy{'9998'} = 'AM.PDP-INET';
#$interface_policy{'SOCK'} = 'AM.PDP-SOCK';

# invoke custom hooks or additional configuration files:
#   include_config_files('/etc/amavisd-custom.conf');

# Want to execute additional configuration files from some directory?
#{ my($d) = '/etc/amavis/conf.d';  # do *.cf or *.conf files in this directory
