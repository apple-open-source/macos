This directory contains some useful tcsh files.

In order to use this configuration:

	echo "source /usr/share/init/tcsh/rc"     > ~/.tcshrc
	echo "source /usr/share/init/tcsh/login"  > ~/.login
	echo "source /usr/share/init/tcsh/logout" > ~/.logout

To do this system-wide, do the same instead to /etc/csh.cshrc, /etc/csh.login, and /etc/csh.logout.

In order to customize tcsh:

	mkdir ~/Library/init/tcsh

and create the following files there as necessary:

	aliases.mine		- shell aliases
	completions.mine	- completions
	environment.mine	- environment
	rc.mine			- run commands
	path			- command search path

See the corresponding file in /usr/share/init/tcsh for more information about the role of each file. You can easily extend or override the configuration provided by the default file. For example, you can add more aliases by adding the appropriate commands in aliases.mine.
