 * @function image4_environment_get_firmware_chip
 * Returns the legacy chip pointer corresponding to an environment.
 *
 * @param nv
 * The environment to query.
 *
 * @result
 * Upon success, a pointer to an object which can be safely cast to an
 * `const img4_chip_t *` is returned. If the environment does not support
 * returning a legacy chip, NULL is returned.
 *
 * @availability
 * This API is restricted and should only be called via the
 * {@link image4_restricted_call} macro.
 *
 * This function first became available in restricted API version 1000; it will
 * be functionally neutered in version 2000.
