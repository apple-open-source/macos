 *
 * @section Supported Algorithms
 * The choice of algorithm should be made based on the algorithm that produced
 * the policy closure digest which is being compared.
 *
 * @discussion
 * This coprocessor environment should only be used to compute a policy closure
 * hash that is to be compared to a known-trustworthy measurement. It should not
 * be used to produce a measurement that is to be nominated for signing. The
 * algorithm choice should be made based on the algorithm that produced the

 * @availability
 * This constant first became available in API version 20240223.
