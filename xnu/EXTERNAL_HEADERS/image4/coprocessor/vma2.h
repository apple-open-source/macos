 *
 * @discussion
 * Unlike {@link IMAGE4_COPROCESSOR_AP}, the default handle for this coprocessor
 * will not consult the host's secure boot level since virtualized APs do not
 * have a specific reduced or permissive security policy. They simply use the

 * @availability
 * This coprocessor is available starting in API version 20240318.
