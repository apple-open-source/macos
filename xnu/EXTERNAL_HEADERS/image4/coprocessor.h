 * @section TAPI
 * TAPI doesn't like this because it sort of functions as an umbrella header
 * rather than each of these sub-headers being self-contained. But we don't want
 * to specify this as the public umbrella header because it isn't. We just do
 * this because these coprocessor definitions used to all be in this header, but
 * then it started getting crowded, so we broke them out and didn't want to
 * break dependent projects, which made TAPI upset.
 *
 * So we just don't tell it about the umbrella nature here, since these headers
 * are all self-contained; it's just that we have to make their content
 * available through just an inclusion of this header.

 * @function image4_coprocessor_resolve_from_manifest
 * Resolves the coprocessor environment associated with a manifest.
 *
 * @param manifest
 * A pointer to the Image4 manifest bytes. This buffer may refer to a stitched
 * manifest and payload object, in which case the implementation will extract
 * the manifest portion.
 *
 * @param manifest_len
 * The length of the buffer referenced by {@link manifest}.
 *
 * @param coprocs
 * The list of coprocessors which could possibly authenticate the manifest. This
 * list should be kept as small as possible.
 *
 * @result
 * The coprocessor environment that can be used to authenticate the manifest, or
 * NULL if none of the provided coprocessors could be used.
 *
 * @discussion
 * Generally speaking, callers should have a priori, static knowledge of the
 * environment in which they authenticate payloads. If the caller is responsible
 * for handling payloads for multiple coprocessors, it should make the decision
 * of which coprocessor to use based on static environmental properties or
 * properties that have been forwarded from the previous stage of boot.
 *
 * This interface's existence is a conceit that this is not always possible for
 * certain trust evaluations, e.g. evaluations that need to evaluate content
 * provided by another execution context in order to counter-sign it. In such
 * cases, multiple different manifests for multiple different coprocessor
 * environments may need to be evaluated.
 *
 * This interface intentionally does not attempt to resolve a coprocessor
 * handle. The caller must still possess static knowledge of which handle must
 * be used for which coprocessor.
 *
 * @availability
 * This function first became available in API version 20240216.
