 * manifest known as a "policy closure". This form of a manifest describes all
 * possible personalized instantiations of a manifest. The normalized contents
 * include all items in the signed section, i.e. all object dictionaries are
 * captured.
 *
 * Because this type of trust evaluation operates on all objects in the
 * manifest (as opposed to the object corresponding to a specific payload), only
 * manifest properties are recorded through the
 * {@link image4_trust_record_property_*} family of APIs. The property values
 * recorded are the ones from the source manifest, not the ones which were
 * inserted into the policy closure.
 *
 * Any payload provided to this type of trust evaluation is ignored.
 *
 * @section Trust Evaluation Result
 * Upon successful evaluation, the result is a pointer to the resulting Image4
 * manifest object representing the closure.
 *
 * @discussion
 * This trust evaluation is only supported on targets which have an allocator.
 * The pointer to the resulting bytes is not valid beyond the scope of the
 * trust evaluation callback.
 *
 * @availability
 * This constant first became available in API version 20231215.
