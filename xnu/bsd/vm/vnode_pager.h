/*
 *  Vstructs are the internal (to us) description of a unit of backing store.
 *  The are the link between memory objects and the backing store they represent.
 *  For the vnode pager, backing store comes in two flavors: normal files and
 *  swap files.
 *
 *  For objects that page to and from normal files (e.g. objects that represent
 *  program text segments), we maintain some simple parameters that allow us to
 *  access the file's contents directly through the vnode interface.
 *
 *  Data for objects without associated vnodes is maintained in the swap files.
 *  Each object that uses one of these as backing store has a vstruct indicating
 *  the swap file of preference (vs_pf) and a mapping between contiguous object
 *  offsets and swap file offsets (vs_pmap).  Each entry in this mapping specifies
 *  the pager file to use, and the offset of the page in that pager file.  These
 *  mapping entries are of type pfMapEntry.
