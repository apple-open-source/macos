 * We start with a heap, which is used in the scheduler to decide when

 * The key for the heap is used for two different values:

 *
 * 2. virtual times. These increase in steps of len/x, where len is the
 *    packet length, and x is either the weight of the flow, or the
 *    sum of all weights.
 *    If we limit to max 1000 flows and a max weight of 100, then
 *    x needs 17 bits. The packet size is 16 bits, so we can easily
 *    overflow if we do not allow errors.
 * So we use a key "dn_key" which is 64 bits. Some macros are used to
 * compare key values and handle wraparounds.
 * MAX64 returns the largest of two key values.
 * MY_M is used as a shift count when doing fixed point arithmetic
 * (a better name would be useful...).

/*
 * Overall structure of dummynet (with WF2Q+):
 *
 *  In dummynet, packets are selected with the firewall rules, and passed
 *  to two different objects: PIPE or QUEUE.
 *
 *  A QUEUE is just a queue with configurable size and queue management
 *  policy. It is also associated with a mask (to discriminate among
 *  different flows), a weight (used to give different shares of the
 *  bandwidth to different flows) and a "pipe", which essentially
 *  supplies the transmit clock for all queues associated with that
 *  pipe.
 *
 *  A PIPE emulates a fixed-bandwidth link, whose bandwidth is
 *  configurable.  The "clock" for a pipe can come from either an
 *  internal timer, or from the transmit interrupt of an interface.
 *  A pipe is also associated with one (or more, if masks are used)
 *  queue, where all packets for that pipe are stored.
 *
 *  The bandwidth available on the pipe is shared by the queues
 *  associated with that pipe (only one in case the packet is sent
 *  to a PIPE) according to the WF2Q+ scheduling algorithm and the
 *  configured weights.
 *
 *  In general, incoming packets are stored in the appropriate queue,
 *  which is then placed into one of a few heaps managed by a scheduler
 *  to decide when the packet should be extracted.
 *  The scheduler (a function called dummynet()) is run at every timer
 *  tick, and grabs queues from the head of the heaps when they are
 *  ready for processing.
 *
 *  There are three data structures definining a pipe and associated queues:
 *
 + dn_pipe, which contains the main configuration parameters related
 +  to delay and bandwidth;
 + dn_flow_set, which contains WF2Q+ configuration, flow
 +  masks, plr and RED configuration;
 + dn_flow_queue, which is the per-flow queue (containing the packets)
 +
 +  Multiple dn_flow_set can be linked to the same pipe, and multiple
 +  dn_flow_queue can be linked to the same dn_flow_set.
 +  All data structures are linked in a linear list which is used for
 +  housekeeping purposes.
 +
 +  During configuration, we create and initialize the dn_flow_set
 +  and dn_pipe structures (a dn_pipe also contains a dn_flow_set).
 +
 +  At runtime: packets are sent to the appropriate dn_flow_set (either
 +  WFQ ones, or the one embedded in the dn_pipe for fixed-rate flows),
 +  which in turn dispatches them to the appropriate dn_flow_queue
 +  (created dynamically according to the masks).
 +
 +  The transmit clock for fixed rate flows (ready_event()) selects the
 +  dn_flow_queue to be used to transmit the next packet. For WF2Q,
 +  wfq_ready_event() extract a pipe which in turn selects the right
 +  flow using a number of heaps defined into the pipe itself.
 +
 *
