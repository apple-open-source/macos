Custom pointer support

This module provides support for special pointer types that are not native to the
language used by the target being debugged. Such pointers may be represented as a struct
or class (for example IOKit's shared pointers).

A custom pointer class must subclass the PointerPolicy class and implement all of its
abstract methods. The MetaPointerPolicy metaclass ensures that all known subclasses are
registered in a global list (wherever they are located in the lldb macro sources).

A client can obtain a PointerPolicy instance by calling the match method with an SBValue
instance as an argument. The returned value is one of:

    * None - the match was unsuccessful and this SBValue instance is not a pointer.
    * Concrete instance - An instance of the concrete PointerPolicy class that will handle
      pointer operations for the given SBValue.

Concrete policy instances implement an API that allows a client to operate on a value
like a native pointer (for example unwrapping a native pointer from a smart pointer).

Example:

    # Obtain an SBValue instance.
    val = kern.global.GlobalVariable.GetSBValue()

    # Try to match the pointer policy for the given value.
    policy = PointerPolicy.match(val)

    # Unwrap the pointer SBValue.
    if policy:
        val = policy.GetPointerSBValue(val)

    ... Operate on val as usual.
