# Network Interface Configuration
#
# This file determined how the machine's network interfaces are
# configured.  Each line is a rule beginning with an interface
# pattern followed by a protocol/address family and a set of
# parameters supplied to ifconfig, or a command line to execute.
# Each interface is matched against the patterns in this file and
# the first one found for each unique protocol/address family will
# be executed.  As shipped, this file will do automatic internet
# (inet) configuration for all interfaces (*).
#
# The interface name can use asterisks (*) to match any
# substring.  The protocol/address family can be any string.
# The rest of the line will be given to ifconfig unless it is
# preceeded by an exclamation mark (!), in which case it will be
# executed as a command.  In the latter case, the variable $if
# can be used to refer to the interface name to be configured.
