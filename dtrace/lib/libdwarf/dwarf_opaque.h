    This structure provides the context for a compilation unit.

    belongs to.  It contains the information in the compilation 
    unit header, cc_length, cc_version_stamp, cc_abbrev_offset,
    and cc_address_size, in the .debug_info section for that cu.  
    In addition, it contains the count, cc_count_cu, of the cu 
    number of that cu in the list of cu's in the .debug_info.  
    The count starts at 1, ie cc_count_cu is 1 for the first cu, 
    2 for the second and so on.  This struct also contains a 
    pointer, cc_abbrev_table, to a list of pairs of abbrev code

    in the .debug_abbrev section.

    Each die will also contain a pointer to such a struct to
