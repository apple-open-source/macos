   READ_AREA LENGTH reads the length (the older way

   or the new proposed dwarfv2.1 64bit-extension way)

   It reads the bits from where rw_src_data_p  points to 
   and updates the rw_src_data_p to point past what was just read.

   It updates w_length_size and w_exten_size (which
	are really issues only for the dwarfv2.1  64bit extension).

   r_dbg is just the current dbg pointer.
   w_target is the output length field.
   r_targtype is the output type. Always Dwarf_Unsigned so far.

/* This one handles the v2.1 64bit extension  
   and 32bit (and   MIPS fixed 64  bit via the
	dwarf_init-set r_dbg->de_length_size)..
   It does not recognize any but the one distingushed value
   (the only one with defined meaning).
   It assumes that no CU will have a length
	0xffffffxx  (32bit length)
	or
	0xffffffxx xxxxxxxx (64bit length)
   which makes possible auto-detection of the extension.

   This depends on knowing that only a non-zero length
   is legitimate (AFAICT), and for IRIX non-standard -64 
   dwarf that the first 32 bits of the 64bit offset will be
   zero (because the compiler could not handle a truly large 
   value as of Jan 2003 and because no app has that much debug 
   info anyway (yet)).

   At present not testing for '64bit elf' here as that
   does not seem necessary (none of the 64bit length seems 
   appropriate unless it's  ident[EI_CLASS] == ELFCLASS64).
   Might be a good idea though.
