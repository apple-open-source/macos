-- Fixes in TCIC-2 autodetect and event handling.
-- Updated 3c589_cs driver to parallel changes to 3c509 driver.
-- Changed all client drivers so they can be manually unloaded as long
   as their devices are not in use.

-- Minor cleanups of Makefiles.
-- Better error handling for all Card Services stuff.
-- Minor improvements in debug tools.
-- Small fix in 3c589_cs driver.
-- Checked with 1.1.51 kernel.

Version 2.2.3
-- Added 'expert' flag (-x) to probe -- this does a somewhat risky but
   thorough search for a TCIC-2 chip.  But, it doesn't work yet.
-- Fixed bug in CS that prevented clean unloading of modules.
-- Fixed 'kmalloc called nonatomically' bug in ibmcc_cs.
-- Added extra test to i82365 to fix socket counting for some clones.
-- Added write protect test to memory card driver.
-- Man pages for cardmgr, config file, and drivers!
-- Changed default config script to automatically link /dev/modem to
   a modem or serial card.

Version 2.2.2
-- Added 'anonymous' card type to cardmgr, so that cards with no CIS
   information can be bound to the memory card driver.

Version 2.2.1
-- Checked with 1.1.49.
-- Minor install bug fixes.

[30-Aug-94] Version 2.2
-- Cleaned up README's

Version 2.1.4
-- Added 'poll_delay' parameter to tcic module to control busy loop.
-- Checked against 1.1.48.
-- Fixed the shared-memory IBM CCAE driver.
-- Removed (broken) IBM CCAE support from DE650 driver.
-- Better Cirrus PD67xx register dumping in dump_i365
-- Minor improvements to trim down module sizes

Version 2.1.3
-- Added preliminary shared memory driver for IBM CCAE cards.

Version 2.1.2
-- Added setup of "misc" register for IBM CCAE cards.
-- Cleaned up header files.
-- Fixed pcmem_cs for 1.1.47.

Version 2.1.1
-- Fixed network setup bug in config.sample.

Version 2.1
-- Checked against 1.1.46
-- Added memory card driver, pcmem_cs, providing character and block
   devices for accessing PCMCIA card memory.
-- Moved cardmgr from /usr/sbin to /sbin.
-- Added 'sockets' parameter to i82365 for systems where the probe
   does not give the right answer.
-- Added support for memory windows to CS.
-- Working on support for IBM CCAE in de650_cs.c.
-- Changed ds.c to relay major and minor device #'s as well as device
   names; now cardmgr can create device files on the fly.
-- Changed tcic driver to support alternate base addresses for the
   TCIC-2 chip, via an 'insmod' parameter setting.
-- Moved all configuration options to 'make.options', cleaned up the
   Makefiles, so that builds will be warning-free.
-- Updated modules for 1.1.44.
-- Cleaned up event handling in CS to make insert/removal detection
   more robust -- seems to help with MHz XJ2144.
-- Fixed bug in cardmgr temporary device file unlinking that was
   causing /tmp to fill up with bogus device files.
-- Fixed cardmgr to log messages on the console when syslogd is not
   running.
-- No patches needed for 1.1.43 kernel!
-- Added some hooks to CS so that it can be tweaked when you load it.
-- Added sti()'s to all the CS interrupt routines, added more timeouts
   to hopefully lower chance of deadlocks.

Version 2.0
-- Updated patches for 1.1.42 kernel.
-- Major file reorganization: now all the pcmcia stuff is segregated
   in one directory tree.
-- Changed device code in ds.c to grab the first free character
   device number.  Also changed cardmgr to read /proc/devices to
   determine what device number was found.  This eliminates the
   need for a kernel patch to include/linux/major.h.
-- Moved the "improved" resource registrar code out of ioport.c and
   into drivers/pcmcia, since it seems unlikely to be adopted any time
   soon.  
-- Changed DE650 driver so that it will pick I/O ports aligned to a 32
   port boundary between 0x300 and 0x400, since odd boundaries don't
   work.
-- Fixed IBM modem test in serial driver so it won't bail on modems
   with incomplete CIS's.
-- Working on simplifying configuration of 3c589 driver.  Now you can
   set if_port from insmod: "insmod 3c589_cs.o if_port=#".  This still
   isn't useful, because cardmgr doesn't allow arguments for modules.

[06-Aug-94] Version 1.7
-- Changed serial driver to actually use the ports specified in the
   CIS.  This fixes Intel modems (and others??).
-- Support for 3Com 3c589 ethernet!
-- Support for IBM high-speed modems.

Version 1.6
-- Updated patches for kernel level 1.1.38.
-- Fixed serial driver to enable audio output.
-- Added GetStatus call to Card Services, added to 'status' reports.
-- Added 'probe' program to report PCMCIA controller type.
-- Added 'dump_i365' program to dump Intel and Cirrus registers.
-- Added 'dump_tcic' program to dump TCIC-2 registers.
-- Added -DPOLL_STATUS option to cs.c, to support explicit polling of
   card status changes on systems where card insertion/removal irq's
   don't seem to work.
-- Added 'dump_cisreg' program to dump CIS registers.
-- Better card status change handling with TCIC-2 controller.

Version 1.5
-- Attempt to fix card insertion/removal detection for TCIC-2.
-- Installation bug fixes.
-- Added 'tuples' program to dump CIS data.

Version 1.4
-- Updated patches for kernel level 1.1.35.
-- Fixed cardmgr to look in /sbin for the module utilities.

Version 1.3
-- Alpha support for TCIC-2 controller.

Version 1.1
-- Included missing cisreg.h header file.

Version 1.0
-- First release.
