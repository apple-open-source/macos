Character Translation
=====================

   `Screen' has a powerful mechanism to translate characters to
arbitrary strings depending on the current font and terminal type.  Use
this feature if you want to work with a common standard character set
(say ISO8851-latin1) even on terminals that scatter the more unusual
characters over several national language font pages.

   Syntax:

         XC=<CHARSET-MAPPING>{,,<CHARSET-MAPPING>}
         <CHARSET-MAPPING> := <DESIGNATOR><TEMPLATE>{,<MAPPING>}
         <MAPPING> := <CHAR-TO-BE-MAPPED><TEMPLATE-ARG>

   The things in braces may be repeated any number of times.

   A <CHARSET-MAPPING> tells screen how to map characters in font
<DESIGNATOR> (`B': Ascii, `A': UK, `K': german, etc.)  to strings.
Every <MAPPING> describes to what string a single character will be
translated. A template mechanism is used, as most of the time the codes
have a lot in common (for example strings to switch to and from another
charset). Each occurrence of `%' in <TEMPLATE> gets substituted with the
TEMPLATE-ARG specified together with the character. If your strings are
not similar at all, then use `%' as a template and place the full
string in <TEMPLATE-ARG>. A quoting mechanism was added to make it
possible to use a real `%'. The `\' character quotes the special
characters `\', `%', and `,'.

   Here is an example:

         termcap hp700 'XC=B\E(K%\E(B,\304[,\326\\\\,\334]'

   This tells `screen', how to translate ISOlatin1 (charset `B') upper
case umlaut characters on a `hp700' terminal that has a german charset.
`\304' gets translated to `\E(K[\E(B' and so on.  Note that this line
gets parsed *three* times before the internal lookup table is built,
therefore a lot of quoting is needed to create a single `\'.

   Another extension was added to allow more emulation: If a mapping
translates the unquoted `%' char, it will be sent to the terminal
whenever screen switches to the corresponding <DESIGNATOR>.  In this
special case the template is assumed to be just `%' because the charset
switch sequence and the character mappings normally haven't much in
common.

   This example shows one use of the extension:
         termcap xterm 'XC=K%,%\E(B,[\304,\\\\\326,]\334'

   Here, a part of the german (`K') charset is emulated on an xterm.
If screen has to change to the `K' charset, `\E(B' will be sent to the
terminal, i.e. the ASCII charset is used instead. The template is just
`%', so the mapping is straightforward: `[' to `\304', `\' to `\326',
and `]' to `\334'.

The Message Line
****************

   `screen' displays informational messages and other diagnostics in a
"message line" at the bottom of the screen.  If your terminal has a
status line defined in its termcap, screen will use this for displaying
its messages, otherwise the last line of the screen will be temporarily
overwritten and output will be momentarily interrupted.  The message
line is automatically removed after a few seconds delay, but it can also
be removed early (on terminals without a status line) by beginning to
type.

* Menu:

* Privacy Message::             Using the message line from your program.
* Hardware Status Line::        Use the terminal's hardware status line.
* Last Message::                Redisplay the last message.
* Message Wait::                Control how long messages are displayed.


File: screen.info,  Node: Privacy Message,  Next: Hardware Status Line,  Up: Message Line

Using the message line from your program
========================================

   The message line facility can be used by an application running in
the current window by means of the ANSI "Privacy message" control
sequence.  For instance, from within the shell, try something like:

     echo "^Hello world from window $WINDOW\"

   where `' is ASCII ESC and `^' is a literal caret or up-arrow.


File: screen.info,  Node: Hardware Status Line,  Next: Last Message,  Prev: Privacy Message,  Up: Message Line

Hardware Status Line
====================

 - Command: hardstatus [state]
 - Command: hardstatus [`always']`lastline'|`message'|`ignore' [string]
 - Command: hardstatus `string' [string]
     (none)
     This command configures the use and emulation of the terminal's
     hardstatus line. The first form toggles whether `screen' will use
     the hardware status line to display messages. If the flag is set
     to `off', these messages are overlaid in reverse video mode at the
     display line. The default setting is `on'.

     The second form tells screen what to do if the terminal doesn't
     have a hardstatus line (i.e. the termcap/terminfo capabilities
     "hs", "ts", "fs" and "ds" are not set). If the type `lastline' is
     used, screen will reserve the last line of the display for the
     hardstatus. `message' uses `screen''s message mechanism and
     `ignore' tells `screen' never to display the hardstatus.  If you
     prepend the word `always' to the type, `screen' will use the type
     even if the terminal supports a hardstatus line.

     The third form specifies the contents of the hardstatus line.
     `%h' is used as default string, i.e. the stored hardstatus of the
     current window (settable via `ESC]0;^G' or `ESC_\\') is displayed.
     You can customize this to any string you like including string
     escapes (*note String Escapes::).  If you leave out the argument
     STRING, the current string is displayed.

     You can mix the second and third form by providing the string as
     additional argument.


File: screen.info,  Node: Last Message,  Next: Message Wait,  Prev: Hardware Status Line,  Up: Message Line

Display Last Message
====================

 - Command: lastmsg
     (`C-a m', `C-a C-m')
     Repeat the last message displayed in the message line.  Useful if
     you're typing when a message appears, because (unless your
     terminal has a hardware status line) the message goes away when
     you press a key.


File: screen.info,  Node: Message Wait,  Prev: Last Message,  Up: Message Line

Message Wait
============

 - Command: msgminwait sec
     (none)
     Defines the time `screen' delays a new message when another is
     currently displayed.  Defaults to 1 second.

 - Command: msgwait sec
     (none)
     Defines the time a message is displayed, if `screen' is not
     disturbed by other activity.  Defaults to 5 seconds.

Logging
*******

   This section describes the commands for keeping a record of your
session.

* Menu:

* Hardcopy::                    Dump the current screen to a file
* Log::                         Log the output of a window to a file


File: screen.info,  Node: Hardcopy,  Next: Log,  Up: Logging

hardcopy
========

 - Command: hardcopy
     (`C-a h', `C-a C-h')
     Writes out the current display contents to the file `hardcopy.N'
     in the window's default directory, where N is the number of the
     current window.  This either appends or overwrites the file if it
     exists, as determined by the `hardcopy_append' command.

 - Command: hardcopy_append state
     (none)
     If set to `on', `screen' will append to the `hardcopy.N' files
     created by the command `hardcopy'; otherwise, these files are
     overwritten each time.

 - Command: hardcopydir directory
     (none)
     Defines a directory where hardcopy files will be placed.  If unset
     hardcopys are dumped in screen's current working directory.


File: screen.info,  Node: Log,  Prev: Hardcopy,  Up: Logging

log
===

 - Command: log [state]
     (`C-a H')
     Begins/ends logging of the current window to the file
     `screenlog.N' in the window's default directory, where N is the
     number of the current window.  This filename can be changed with
     the `logfile' command.  If no parameter is given, the logging
     state is toggled.  The session log is appended to the previous
     contents of the file if it already exists.  The current contents
     and the contents of the scrollback history are not included in the
     session log.  Default is `off'.

 - Command: logfile filename
 - Command: logfile flush secs
     (none)
     Defines the name the logfiles will get. The default is
     `screenlog.%n'.  The second form changes the number of seconds
     `screen' will wait before flushing the logfile buffer to the
     file-system. The default value is 10 seconds.

 - Command: logtstamp [state]
 - Command: logtstamp `after' secs
 - Command: logtstamp `string' string
     (none)
     This command controls logfile time-stamp mechanism of screen. If
     time-stamps are turned `on', screen adds a string containing the
     current time to the logfile after two minutes of inactivity.  When
     output continues and more than another two minutes have passed, a
     second time-stamp is added to document the restart of the output.
     You can change this timeout with the second form of the command.
     The third form is used for customizing the time-stamp string (`--
     %n:%t -- time-stamp -- %M/%d/%y %c:%s --\n' by default).


File: screen.info,  Node: Startup,  Next: Miscellaneous,  Prev: Logging,  Up: Top

Startup
*******

   This section describes commands which are only useful in the
`.screenrc' file, for use at startup.

* Menu:

* echo::                        Display a message.
* sleep::                       Pause execution of the `.screenrc'.
* Startup Message::             Control display of the copyright notice.


File: screen.info,  Node: echo,  Next: sleep,  Up: Startup

echo
====

 - Command: echo [`-n'] message
     (none)
     The echo command may be used to annoy `screen' users with a
     'message of the day'. Typically installed in a global screenrc.
     The option `-n' may be used to suppress the line feed.  See also
     `sleep'.  Echo is also useful for online checking of environment
     variables.


File: screen.info,  Node: sleep,  Next: Startup Message,  Prev: echo,  Up: Startup

sleep
=====

 - Command: sleep num
     (none)
     This command will pause the execution of a .screenrc file for NUM
     seconds.  Keyboard activity will end the sleep.  It may be used to
     give users a chance to read the messages output by `echo'.


File: screen.info,  Node: Startup Message,  Prev: sleep,  Up: Startup

Startup Message
===============

 - Command: startup_message state
     (none)
     Select whether you want to see the copyright notice during startup.
     Default is `on', as you probably noticed.

File: screen.info,  Node: At,  Next: Break,  Up: Miscellaneous

At
==

 - Command: at [identifier][#|*|%] command [args]
     (none)
     Execute a command at other displays or windows as if it had been
     entered there.  `At' changes the context (the `current window' or
     `current display' setting) of the command. If the first parameter
     describes a non-unique context, the command will be executed
     multiple times. If the first parameter is of the form
     `IDENTIFIER*' then identifier is matched against user names.  The
     command is executed once for each display of the selected user(s).
     If the first parameter is of the form `IDENTIFIER%' identifier is
     matched against displays. Displays are named after the ttys they
     attach. The prefix `/dev/' or `/dev/tty' may be omitted from the
     identifier.  If IDENTIFIER has a `#' or nothing appended it is
     matched against window numbers and titles. Omitting an identifier
     in front of the `#', `*' or `%' character selects all users,
     displays or windows because a prefix-match is performed. Note that
     on the affected display(s) a short message will describe what
     happened.  Note that the `#' character works as a comment
     introducer when it is preceded by whitespace. This can be escaped
     by prefixing `#' with a `\'.  Permission is checked for the
     initiator of the `at' command, not for the owners of the affected
     display(s).  Caveat: When matching against windows, the command is
     executed at least once per window. Commands that change the
     internal arrangement of windows (like `other') may be called
     again. In shared windows the command will be repeated for each
     attached display. Beware, when issuing toggle commands like
     `login'!  Some commands (e.g. `stuff', `\*Qprocess' or `paste')
     require that a display is associated with the target windows.
     These commands may not work correctly under `at' looping over
     windows.


File: screen.info,  Node: Break,  Next: Debug,  Prev: At,  Up: Miscellaneous

Break
=====

 - Command: break [duration]
     (none)
     Send a break signal for DURATION*0.25 seconds to this window.  For
     non-Posix systems the time interval is rounded up to full seconds.
     Most useful if a character device is attached to the window rather
     than a shell process (*note Window Types::). The maximum duration
     of a break signal is limited to 15 seconds.

 - Command: pow_break
     (none)
     Reopen the window's terminal line and send a break condition.

 - Command: breaktype [tcsendbreak|TIOCSBRK|TCSBRK]
     (none)
     Choose one of the available methods of generating a break signal
     for terminal devices. This command should affect the current
     window only.  But it still behaves identical to `defbreaktype'.
     This will be changed in the future.  Calling `breaktype' with no
     parameter displays the break setting for the current window.

 - Command: defbreaktype [tcsendbreak|TIOCSBRK|TCSBRK]
     (none)
     Choose one of the available methods of generating a break signal
     for terminal devices opened afterwards. The preferred methods are
     `tcsendbreak' and `TIOCSBRK'. The third, `TCSBRK', blocks the
     complete `screen' session for the duration of the break, but it
     may be the only way to generate long breaks. `tcsendbreak' and
     `TIOCSBRK' may or may not produce long breaks with spikes (e.g. 4
     per second). This is not only system dependant, this also differs
     between serial board drivers.  Calling `defbreaktype' with no
     parameter displays the current setting.


File: screen.info,  Node: Debug,  Next: License,  Prev: Break,  Up: Miscellaneous

Debug
=====

 - Command: debug [on|off]
     (none)
     Turns runtime debugging on or off. If `screen' has been compiled
     with option `-DDEBUG' debugging is available and is turned on per
     default.  Note that this command only affects debugging output
     from the main `SCREEN' process correctly. Debug output from
     attacher processes can only be turned off once and forever.


File: screen.info,  Node: License,  Next: Nethack,  Prev: Debug,  Up: Miscellaneous

License
=======

 - Command: license
     (none)
     Display the disclaimer page. This is done whenever `screen' is
     started without options, which should be often enough.


File: screen.info,  Node: Nethack,  Next: Nonblock,  Prev: License,  Up: Miscellaneous

Nethack
=======

 - Command: nethack state
     (none)
     Changes the kind of error messages used by `screen'.  When you are
     familiar with the game `nethack', you may enjoy the nethack-style
     messages which will often blur the facts a little, but are much
     funnier to read. Anyway, standard messages often tend to be
     unclear as well.

     This option is only available if `screen' was compiled with the
     NETHACK flag defined (*note Installation::). The default setting
     is then determined by the presence of the environment variable
     `$NETHACKOPTIONS'.


File: screen.info,  Node: Nonblock,  Next: Number,  Prev: Nethack,  Up: Miscellaneous

Nonblock
========

 - Command: nonblock STATE
     Enable or disable flow control for the current  user  interface
     (display). It is used to prevent a slow display from slowing down
     the processing of data output by a window. This command may be
     helpful when multiple displays show the same window.  `Nonblock'
     is initially off for all displays.


File: screen.info,  Node: Number,  Next: Silence,  Prev: Nonblock,  Up: Miscellaneous

Number
======

 - Command: number [N]
     (`C-a N')
     Change the current window's number. If the given number N is
     already used by another window, both windows exchange their
     numbers. If no argument is specified, the current window number
     (and title) is shown.


File: screen.info,  Node: Silence,  Next: Time,  Prev: Number,  Up: Miscellaneous

Silence
=======

 - Command: silence [STATE|SEC]
     (none)
     Toggles silence monitoring of windows. When silence is turned on
     and an affected window is switched into the background, you will
     receive the silence notification message in the status line after
     a specified period of inactivity (silence). The default timeout
     can be changed with the `silencewait' command or by specifying a
     number of seconds instead of `on' or `off'. Silence is initially
     off for all windows.

 - Command: defsilence state
     (none)
     Same as the `silence' command except that the default setting for
     new windows is changed.  Initial setting is `off'.

 - Command: silencewait SECONDS
     (none)
     Define the time that all windows monitored for silence should wait
     before displaying a message. Default is 30 seconds.


File: screen.info,  Node: Time,  Next: Verbose,  Prev: Silence,  Up: Miscellaneous

Time
====

 - Command: time
     (`C-a t', `C-a C-t')
     Uses the message line to display the time of day, the host name,
     and the load averages over 1, 5, and 15 minutes (if this is
     available on your system).  For window-specific information use
     `info' (*note Info::).


File: screen.info,  Node: Verbose,  Next: Version,  Prev: Time,  Up: Miscellaneous

Verbose
=======

 - Command: verbose [on|off]
     If verbose is switched on, the command name is echoed, whenever a
     window is created (or resurrected from zombie state). Default is
     off.  Without parameter, the current setting is shown.


File: screen.info,  Node: Version,  Next: Zombie,  Prev: Verbose,  Up: Miscellaneous

Version
=======

 - Command: version
     (`C-a v')
     Display the version and modification date in the message line.


File: screen.info,  Node: Zombie,  Next: Printcmd,  Prev: Version,  Up: Miscellaneous

Zombie
======

 - Command: zombie [KEYS]
 - Command: defzombie [KEYS]
     (none)
     Per default windows are removed from the window list as soon as the
     windows process (e.g. shell) exits. When a string of two keys is
     specified to the zombie command, `dead' windows will remain in the
     list.  The `kill' command may be used to remove the window.
     Pressing the first key in the dead window has the same effect.
     Pressing the second key, however, screen will attempt to resurrect
     the window. The process that was initially running in the window
     will be launched again. Calling `zombie' without parameters will
     clear the zombie setting, thus making windows disappear when the
     process terminates.

     As the zombie setting is affected globally for all windows, this
     command should only be called `defzombie'. Until we need this as a
     per window setting, the commands `zombie' and `defzombie' are
     synonymous.


File: screen.info,  Node: Printcmd,  Next: Sorendition,  Prev: Zombie,  Up: Miscellaneous

Printcmd
========

 - Command: printcmd [CMD]
     (none)
     If CMD is not an empty string, screen will not use the terminal
     capabilities `po/pf' for printing if it detects an ansi print
     sequence `ESC [ 5 i', but pipe the output into CMD.  This should
     normally be a command like `lpr' or `cat > /tmp/scrprint'.
     `Printcmd' without an argument displays the current setting.  The
     ansi sequence `ESC \' ends printing and closes the pipe.

     Warning: Be careful with this command! If other user have write
     access to your terminal, they will be able to fire off print
     commands.


File: screen.info,  Node: Sorendition,  Next: Attrcolor,  Prev: Printcmd,  Up: Miscellaneous

Sorendition
===========

 - Command: sorendition [ATTR [COLOR]]
     (none)
     Change the way screen does highlighting for text marking and
     printing messages.  See the chapter about string escapes (*note
     String Escapes::) for the syntax of the modifiers. The default is
     currently `=s dd' (standout, default colors).


File: screen.info,  Node: Attrcolor,  Prev: Sorendition,  Up: Miscellaneous

Attrcolor
=========

 - Command: attrcolor ATTRIB [ATTRIBUTE/COLOR-MODIFIER]
     (none)
     This command can be used to highlight attributes by changing the
     color of the text. If the attribute ATTRIB is in use, the
     specified attribute/color modifier is also applied. If no modifier
     is given, the current one is deleted. See the chapter about string
     escapes (*note String Escapes::) for the syntax of the modifier.

     Examples:
    `attrcolor b "R"'
          Change the color to bright red if bold text is to be printed

    `attrcolor u "-u b"'
          Use blue text instead of underline

    `attrcolor b "I"'
          Use bright colors for bold text. Most terminal emulators do
          this already

String Escapes
**************

   Screen provides an escape mechanism to insert information like the
current time into messages or file names. The escape character is `%'
with one exception: inside of a window's hardstatus `^%' (`^E') is used
instead.

   Here is the full list of supported escapes:

`%'
     the escape character itself

`a'
     either `am' or `pm'

`A'
     either `AM' or `PM'

`c'
     current time `HH:MM' in 24h format

`C'
     current time `HH:MM' in 12h format

`d'
     day number

`D'
     weekday name

`h'
     hardstatus of the window

`l'
     current load of the system

`m'
     month number

`M'
     month name

`n'
     window number

`s'
     seconds

`t'
     window title

`u'
     all other users on this window

`w'
     all window numbers and names

`W'
     all window numbers and names except the current one

`y'
     last two digits of the year number

`Y'
     full year number

`?'
     the part to the next `%?' is displayed only if an escape expands
     to an nonempty string

`:'
     else part of `%?'

`{'
     attribute/color modifier string terminated by the next `}' The `c'
and `C' escape may be qualified with a `0' to make screen use zero
instead of space as fill character. The `n' escape understands a length
qualifier (e.g. `%3n').

   An attribute/color modifier is is used to change the attributes or
the color settings. Its format is `[attribute modifier] [color
description]'. The attribute modifier must be prefixed by a change type
indicator if it can be confused with a color desciption. The following
change types are known:
`+'
     add the specified set to the current attributes

`-'
     remove the set from the current attributes

`!'
     invert the set in the current attributes

`='
     change the current attributes to the specified set The attribute
set can either be specified as a hexadecimal number or a combination of
the following letters:
`u'
     underline

`b'
     bold

`r'
     reverse

`s'
     standout

`B'
     blinking Colors are coded either as a hexadecimal number or two
letters specifying the desired background and foreground color (in that
order). The following colors are known:
`k'
     black

`r'
     red

`g'
     green

`y'
     yellow

`b'
     blue

`m'
     magenta

`c'
     cyan

`w'
     white

`d'
     default color

`.'
     leave color unchanged The capitalized versions of the letter
specify bright colors. You can also use the pseudo-color `i' to set
just the brightness and leave the color unchanged.

   A one digit/letter color description is treated as foreground or
background color dependant on the current attributes: if reverse mode is
set, the background color is changed instead of the foreground color.
If you don't like this, prefix the color with a `.'. If you want the
same behaviour for two-letter color descriptions, also prefix them with
a `.'.

Examples:
`G'
     set color to bright green

`+b r'
     use bold red

`= yd'
     clear all attributes, write in default color on yellow background.

Version
=======

   This manual describes version 3.9.9 of the `screen' program. Its
roots are a merge of a custom version 2.3PR7 by Wayne Davison and
several enhancements to Oliver Laumann's version 2.0.  Note that all
versions numbered 2.x are copyright by Oliver Laumann.

Bugs
****

   Just like any other significant piece of software, `screen' has a
few bugs and missing features.  Please send in a bug report if you have
found a bug not mentioned here.

* Menu:

* Known Bugs::                  Problems we know about.
* Reporting Bugs::              How to contact the maintainers.
* Availability::                Where to find the lastest screen version.

Known Bugs
==========

   * `dm' (delete mode) and `xs' are not handled correctly (they are
     ignored).  `xn' is treated as a magic-margin indicator.

   * `screen' has no clue about double-high or double-wide characters.
     But this is the only area where `vttest' is allowed to fail.

   * It is not possible to change the environment variable `$TERMCAP'
     when reattaching under a different terminal type.

   * The support of terminfo based systems is very limited. Adding extra
     capabilities to `$TERMCAP' may not have any effects.

   * `screen' does not make use of hardware tabs.

   * `screen' must be installed setuid root on most systems in order to
     be able to correctly change the owner of the tty device file for
     each window.  Special permission may also be required to write the
     file `/etc/utmp'.

   * Entries in `/etc/utmp' are not removed when `screen' is killed
     with SIGKILL.  This will cause some programs (like "w" or "rwho")
     to advertise that a user is logged on who really isn't.

   * `screen' may give a strange warning when your tty has no utmp
     entry.

   * When the modem line was hung up, `screen' may not automatically
     detach (or quit) unless the device driver sends a HANGUP signal.
     To detach such a `screen' session use the -D or -d command line
     option.

   * If a password is set, the command line options -d and -D still
     detach a session without asking.

   * Both `breaktype' and `defbreaktype' change the break generating
     method used by all terminal devices. The first should change a
     window specific setting, where the latter should change only the
     default for new windows.

   * When attaching to a multiuser session, the user's `.screenrc' file
     is not sourced. Each users personal settings have to be included
     in the `.screenrc' file from which the session is booted, or have
     to be changed manually.

   * A weird imagination is most useful to gain full advantage of all
     the features.

Reporting Bugs
==============

   If you find a bug in `Screen', please send electronic mail to
`screen@uni-erlangen.de', and also to `bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu'.
Include the version number of `Screen' which you are using.  Also
include in your message the hardware and operating system, the compiler
used to compile, a description of the bug behavior, and the conditions
that triggered the bug. Please recompile `screen' with the `-DDEBUG'
options enabled, reproduce the bug, and have a look at the debug output
written to the directory `/tmp/debug'. If necessary quote suspect
passages from the debug output and show the contents of your `config.h'
if it matters.

Installation
************

   Since `screen' uses pseudo-ttys, the select system call, and
UNIX-domain sockets/named pipes, it will not run under a system that
does not include these features of 4.2 and 4.3 BSD UNIX.

* Menu:

* Socket Directory::		Where screen stores its handle.
* Compiling Screen::


File: screen.info,  Node: Socket Directory,  Next: Compiling Screen,  Up: Installation

Socket Directory
================

   The socket directory defaults either to `$HOME/.screen' or simply to
`/tmp/screens' or preferably to `/usr/local/screens' chosen at
compile-time. If `screen' is installed setuid root, then the
administrator should compile screen with an adequate (not NFS mounted)
`SOCKDIR'. If `screen' is not running setuid-root, the user can specify
any mode 700 directory in the environment variable `$SCREENDIR'.


File: screen.info,  Node: Compiling Screen,  Prev: Socket Directory,  Up: Installation

Compiling Screen
================

   To compile and install screen:

   The `screen' package comes with a `GNU Autoconf' configuration
script. Before you compile the package run

                           `sh ./configure'

   This will create a `config.h' and `Makefile' for your machine.  If
`configure' fails for some reason, then look at the examples and
comments found in the `Makefile.in' and `config.h.in' templates.
Rename `config.status' to `config.status.MACHINE' when you want to keep
configuration data for multiple architectures. Running `sh
./config.status.MACHINE' recreates your configuration significantly
faster than rerunning `configure'.
Read through the "User Configuration" section of `config.h', and verify
that it suits your needs.  A comment near the top of this section
explains why it's best to install screen setuid to root.  Check for the
place for the global `screenrc'-file and for the socket directory.
Check the compiler used in `Makefile', the prefix path where to install
`screen'. Then run

                                `make'

   If `make' fails to produce one of the files `term.h', `comm.h' or
`tty.c', then use `FILENAME.X.dist' instead.  For additional
information about installation of `screen' refer to the file
`INSTALLATION', coming with this package.
