Description: GNU tape archive utility
 GNU `tar' saves many files together into a single tape or disk
 archive, and can restore individual files from the archive.  It
 includes multivolume support, the ability to archive sparse files,
 automatic archive compression/decompression, remote archives and
 special features that allow `tar' to be used for incremental and full
 backups.
