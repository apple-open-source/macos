 Commands created with DEFINE are interpreted as opposed to plugins/built-ins being

 they are to be interpreted.  It's also used by SHOW USER to display these commands.
 Thus gdb_change_class() which can immediately change the class of plugins cannot do that
 for DEFINE commands.  So it builds the class_user_classes list to record which DEFINE
 commands need to be reclassed.  Since the purpose of the class is to affect the HELP
 display (other than additional items for class_user as just mentioned) we use the list
 to temporarily change the DEFINE class across the HELP command.  That's the reason
 for this intercept routine.

 | gdb_define_class - create a new class or change a plugincommand to a class |
 *----------------------------------------------------------------------------*
 
 Defines a new plugin command class that is NOT one of the predefined classes OR converts
 an existing plugin command into a class.  The function returns the new class value if
 the command did not previously exist or an existing plugin's class, now converted into
 a class.
 
 The classTitle should be a short description to display with the category.  Follow the
 style that gdb uses.  For example, when HELP shows the category for "data", it's help is
 simply "Examining data".
 
 Internally even classes are represented as commands (just ones that cannot be executed).
 That is why there is a relationship between plugin commands and classes.  The only real
 reason you might want to redefine an exiting (plugin) command as a class is when you
 want to use the command's name as a class category for the help display.  Then after
 the display you would convert it back to a plugin command again the way it was created
 in the first place, i.e., by calling gdb_define_cmd().  Of course you need to intercept
 the HELP command to do this.  The gdb_replace_command() call is used to define command
 intercepts so that is relatively easy.
 
 Note, there is a limit of 50 user defined classes (why would you ever define so many?).
 After that the function returns Gdb_Too_Many_Classes.
 
 Also note that the new class values returned are still typed as Gdb_Cmd_Class even
 though they are outside the enum range.

 Generally you never need this if you define your own plugins since you define the class

 to call this function to change their class to your desired class. Further you obviously

 in the .gdbinit script (or one sourced during that time) so that the commands exist
 by the time this routine is called.

 | gdb_fixup_document_help - replace option-spaces in DOCUMENT help with real spaces |
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
 
 Help info for gdb script commands is defined between a DOCUMENT and its matching END. It
 is a "feature" of gdb's handling of DOCUMENT help to strip all leading spaces from the
 help strings as they are read in by gdb.  It also removes all blank lines or lines which
 consist only of a newline.  This makes formatting such help information somewhat of a
 pain!  The work around it is to use a leading "significant space", i.e., option-space,
 which is 0xCA in Mac ASCII.  Then the help strings are displayed as desired.
 
 The problem with using option-spaces for a gdb script command's help is that if the help
 is displayed in any other context other than a xterm terminal (e.g., Project Builder) the
 display might (and for Project Builder, does) explicitly show the "non-printable"
 characters as something unique.  Thus gdb_fixup_document_help() is provided to replace
 all the option-spaces with actual spaces after the script commands are defined and their
 help read by gdb.
 
 Call gdb_fixup_document_help() for each script command whose DOCUMENT help was formatted
 using option-spaces.  If the command is defined and has DOCUMENT help it's options-spaces
 will be replaced with real spaces.  Undefined commands or commands with no help info are
 ignored.

 | gdb_private_data - plugin private data use |
 *--------------------------------------------*
 
 It is possible that there could be multiple instances of the plugin support library and
 that cooperating instances might want to "talk" to each other.  Instance data is
 distinct so they have no direct way to pass data between them unless they can store it
 in gdb itself which is common to all the instances.  Gdb_private_data() is provided
 for this purpose.
 
 A plugin is identified by an (arbitrary) name and associates a block of global data
 with that name.  The pointer to the data is established in gdb by calling
 gdb_private_data() with the name.
 
 Each call to gdb_private_data() with the same name from any library instance returns
 the same pointer to a pointer uniquely associated with the name.  Initially the pointer
 value is NULL so the first instance to establish it should probably allocate (malloc'ed
 space only) the private data to be used among the other instances.
 
 Once the pointer to the data is known each instance can save it privately instead of
 recalling gdb_private_data() although that of course would also work.
 
 In addition to "private" data pointers there is one global data pointer that can be
 used among the library instances.  The pointer to this pointer is returned by 
 gdb_private_data() when a null name (string or pointer) is passed.
 
 It should be pointed out that multiple instances of the plugin support library are
 not totally independent of one another.   See Implementation Considerations at the end
 of gdb.h for further details.

 | gdb_replace_command_hook - replace a command hook with a plugin |
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------*
 
 A command hook in the gdb command language is defined as follows:
 
    DEFINE hook-foo
    ...gdb commands that define the hook...
    END
    
 where foo is some other DEFINE command.
 
 When a hook is defined gdb will call the hook before the command itself.  In the above
 example hook-foo is called before foo itself.
 
 The gdb_replace_command_hook() function allows you to define a plugin in place of, using
 the above example, hook-foo.  Pass the original command name (e.g., "foo") for which the
 hook will be established.  Also pass any help info (hooks are like any other commands)
 and a pointer to the command's plugin implementation which has the same prototype as any
 other plugin.  The hookpost parameter should be passed as 0 (see below).
 
 Starting with GDB 5.x post-command hooks are also allowed, i.e., hooks which are called
 immediately after a command.  Using the above example,
 
    DEFINE hookpost-foo
    ...gdb commands that define the hook...
    END
    
 Defining one of these is the same as defining a pre-command hook except that hookpost 
 should be passed as non-zero.
  
 The function returns an anonymous pointer representing the hook data.  This pointer
 should be passed to gdb_execute_hook() to execute any preexisting hook and to 
 gdb_remove_command_hook() to remove the plugin as a hook.  See those routines for
 further details.
 
 NULL is returned if theCommand does not exist or hookpost was non-zero when using GDB
 4.x which doesn't support post-execute hooks.
 
 The anonymous pointer returned to the user is actually a pointer to the following data:

 | my_target_can_async_p - make gdb it's running a command synchronously |
 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------*
 
 Gdb has the ability to run commands either asynchronously or synchronously.  I think
 it depends on how its built.  Gdb has the following macro defined (in its target.h):
 
   #define target_can_async_p() (current_target.to_can_async_p ())
 
 It uses target_can_async_p() all over the place to determine what it has to do if the
 target program can be run asynchronously.  The current_target.to_can_async_p is a
 pointer to a function of the kind we have here.  It returns 0 for synchronous and 1
 for asynchronous mode.
 
 We always return 0 to make gdb think the commands we execute with gdb_execute_command()
 (who sets current_target.to_can_async_p to point here) are synchronous.  Why always
 synchronous?  Because commands that cause the target to execute (e.g., like NEXTI) 
 queue their output until just before the next command line command!  That breaks the
 paradigm we have established for redirected output and their associated filters.
 
 Consider a plugin that executes does gdb_execute_command("nexti") and also wants to
 redirect the NEXTI output through a filter.  If the NEXTI output is queued up until
 the plugin command is finished then the filter can never get a hold of the output.
 It's too late.  The plugin has long since closed its redirected stream.
 
 By executing the commands synchronously gdb doesn't queue the output.  It will be
 done by the time gdb_execute_command() returns.  And during that time the redirection
 filter got what it was after.
 
 This is a big comment for a function that only returns a 0!  But it is worth the
 explanation.  Because I won't remember why I did it in the future :-)

 The current (redirected) stream is not used for this call and should be used when 
 the caller does have control over the output stream (as opposed to, say using
 gdb_execute_command() where gdb may do the output.
 
 Note that even if output is currently redirected with gdb_redirect_output() for gdb
 command output you can still use gdb_fprintf() for your own GDB_FILE streams that
 are not currently redirected and use their filters.  This allows, for instance, to
 chain output filters (this discussions assumes you read the comments on redirected
 output first).  For example, say you redirect output as follows (assume GDB_FILE
 "stream1" is already open and redirected to "filter1"):
 
 	GDB_FILE *previous_stream;
	
 	stream2 = gdb_open_output(stdout, filter2, &previous_stream);
	previous_stream = gdb_redirect_output(stream2);
	
	...stuff that causes gdb to do prints...
	
	gdb_close_output(stream2);
	
 In filter2 (a prototype of the form gdb_output_filter_ftype) you use it's data 
 parameter as a GDB_FILE stream then doing gdb_fprintf()'s to that stream will cause
 that output to go through filter1.  Further, when you gdb_close_output(stream2) the
 output redirection will again revert back to using filter1 assuming it was the 
 redirected stream in effect when you did the gdb_open_output().
 
 There's no limit on the cascading of the filters using this technique if you define
 the data to hold multiple GDB_FILE's that are passed among a set of cooperating output
 filters all expecting that same data.

 | gdb_setup_argv - build an argv[] vector from a argument list string |
 *---------------------------------------------------------------------*
 
 This builds an argv[] vector from a command line of arguments.  Since each plugin
 command is passed all its arguments as a string, this routine may be convenient to break
 up the line into individual arguments using the standard argv/argc conventions.  It is
 assumed the argv[] array is large enough to hold maxargs+1 entries.  The argv[0] entry
 is set with the argv0 parameter which is assumed to be a command name.  However, if
 argv0 is NULL then argv[0] will contain the first word of s.  The argv[argc] entry is
 always NULL.  The function returns argc as its result.
       
 An argv argument is defined here as any sequence of non-blank characters where blanks
 may be contained in singly or doubly quoted strings or paired parenthesis or paired
 square brackets.  Thus (char *)a[i + 1] represents a single argv argument.  Also escaped
 characters (including hex and octal) are permitted.
 
 The argv[] pointers are pointers into the string s.  String s is MODIFIED to contain
 null characters at the end of each argument.  So the caller must assume s has the same
 lifetime as argv[] and is a modifiable string.
 
 Caution: If you pass the command line arg string passed to a plugin then you run the
 risk of modifying gdb's command line.  This is not a problem unless you intend to all
 the plugin command to be reexecuted when the user enters a null command line (i.e.,
 just a return) to reexecute the previous command.  Since null delimiters are placed
 between the args in the string the reexecuted string will be effectively truncated to
 the first argument.

If the above is enabled then the API itself could be loaded as a plugin which means
it potentially could be shared among severy users of it instead of statically binding
it to each user.  The reason we don't enable it is because we export 4 globals from
the API, gdb_default_stdout, gdb_default_stderr, gdb_current_stdout, and
gdb_current_stderr but the LOAD-PLUGIN command's implementation does not cause those
variables to be exported.  It's due to an "incorrect" argument passed to the service
call that does the load.  Until that is fixed we cannot support the API as a sharable
plugin.
