2009-06-16  Caroline Tice <ctice@apple.com>

	* Makefile:  Add -D_DARWIN_UNLIMITED_STREAMS to CDEBUGFLAGS, to
	allow more than 256 streams to be open at a time.
	
2009-04-07  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Only add -Wno-error=deprecated-declarations to CFLAGS
	on specific OS releases; some compilers don't recognize the flag.

2009-02-23  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Print --help messages to stdout not stderr to match
	gdb's behavior.

2008-11-17  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Tighten up pattern matching for core files.

2008-11-06  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (install-macosx): Call install-chmod-macosx-noprocmod
	unconditionally - build everything without setgid procmod.
	(install): Ditto.

2008-09-17  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Get the executable name of the translate binary via
	a sysctl instead of hardcoding.  Fall back on the hardcoded
	value if necessary.

2008-08-29  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

	* gdb.sh: Only specify an arch to gdb when we have a core file.

2008-08-29  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

	* gdb.sh: Only specify an arch to gdb when we need to.

2008-08-20  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Recognize the file(1) output for an x86_64 core file.
	Rename "requested_architecture" to "requested_arch" and 
	"host_architecture" to "host_arch".
	Add code, commented out currently, to tell if the current system is
	an x86_64 capable one and set host_arch to that.
	Handle cases where a host_arch of x86_64 would have caused problems.

2008-08-20  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

	* gdb.sh: Always specify an arch to gdb when the gdb binary can
	handle 32 and 64 bit variants. And fixed the code that detected
	that $GDB_ROOT was "/".

2008-08-20  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

	* gdb.sh: Modified the startup script to ignore all options when
	auto-detecting and launching the correct gdb, and preferring the
	core file over the executable.

2008-08-15  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Back out Greg's change for a little more refining.

2008-08-14  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

	* gdb.sh: Added support for auto-detecting an executable's architecture
	and launching the correct gdb.

2008-08-07  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: This will be run with RC_ARCHS set to i386 ppc x86_64 --
	handle all three being specified instead if implicitly building x86_64.
	* template.h: Update to handle x86_64, arm.

2008-07-28  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (CFLAGS): Add  -Werror-implicit-function-declaration.

2008-07-25  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (build-gdb): Build the cross gdb's first (e.g. i386 x ppc) 
	because those are the ones that fail to build the most often so let's 
	do them up front.

2008-07-25  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Also build an x86_64 x ppc gdb so we've got both binaries
	3-way fat.
	Only do the installhdrs for ppc native and i386 native; not for each of
	the six gdb combos we're building now when -arch ppc -arch i386 is used.

2008-07-25  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Change up the Makefile to build x86_64 when we're building
	i386, various small changes/cleanups.

2008-06-06  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: A few initial additions to recognize x86_64 architecture.
	More changes may be needed but this gets the configure going.

2008-05-23  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (CDEBUGFLAGS): Add -fasynchronous-unwind-tables.

2008-05-22  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (CFLAGS): Add -Wno-error=deprecated-declarations so
	we don't get binutils failing to build because of stat64 deprectation
	warnings and -Werror.

2008-05-20  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Remove the code to invoke the gdb-for-codewarrior binary.
	Update --help text.

2008-05-13  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: No more libcheckpoint.
	* libcheckpoint/*: Removed.

2008-04-24  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Unset MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET when building
	an arm-native gdb on an i386/ppc system.

2008-04-23  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Issue error message if -arch command line option isn't
	followed by an architecture.

2008-03-26  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (CDEBUGFLAGS): Add -Os back by default.

2008-03-25  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Don't make the native-arm or cross-arm gdbs
	setgid procmod.

2008-03-24  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Set OSABIOPTS when the user specifies armv6; use it when
	invoking gdb.

2007-11-07  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

        *Makefile: Changed CROSS_ROOT to SDKROOT for cross and crossarm
        targets.

2007-07-24  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

        *Makefile: CROSS_ROOT is now used to specify the SDK location
        for cross builds.

2007-06-27  Greg Clayton  <gclayton@apple.com>

        * gdb.sh: Handle arm and armv6 arch variants.
        * Makefile: Ditto.
        (CDEBUGFLAGS): Define default value only if not already defined.
        (crossarm): New target.
        (cross): New target.
        (stamp-build-gdb): Configure and build gdbserver when target 
        is arm darwin.
        (install-gdbserver): New target.
        (check-args): Add arm/armv6 darwin support.
        (install-macosx): Install gdbserver when target is arm darwin.
        
2007-12-05  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Remove -Wno-long-double from Makefile, it is not supported
	by gcc-4.2.
	
2007-10-12  Greg Clayton  (gclayton@apple.com)

	* Makefile (GDB_RC_VERSION): Bump Leopard gdb version up to gdb-900
	to leave a hole for other gdb builds.

2007-07-10  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (GDB_RC_VERSION): Bump Leopard gdb version up to gdb-750
	to leave a hole for Xcode 2.5 gdb submissions on the branch.

2007-05-22  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: If the gdb shell script being run is a soft link to the
	actual shell script, dereference that shell script before determining
	GDB_ROOT.

2007-05-15  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Relnotes.xml: Removed.
	* doc/Relnotes.xml: Added.
	* doc/book.xml: Added.
	* doc/gdb.gutenberg: Added.

2007-05-15  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* ReleaseNotes.xml: Add this file.  It looks like we're responsible for
	maintaining it from now on so might as well have it under cvs.

2007-04-17  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* gdb.sh: Pass the -arch argument on to gdb.

2007-03-08  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Directly hard-code the documentation path.
	
2007-03-05  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (check): Suppress the check makefile command echoing.

2007-03-05  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (install-chmod-macosx): Don't error out if the chgrp procmod
	fails; MacsBug isn't built for i386 so that one will always fail.

2007-03-05  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (check): Print out the files that cause the copy phase
	to fail.

2007-03-05  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (install-chmod-macosx): Don't check for rootness;
	assume this is being run as root.  If chgrp procmod fails, indicate
	failure of the build.

2007-01-16  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* gdb.sh: Call the actual gdb binary relative to
	the location of the gdb shell script, rather than
	using the absolute path.
	
2007-01-10  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* (CDEBUGFLAGS): Drop -g3 until we get macro debug info working
	a little more cleanly.

2006-12-19  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (SYSTEM_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_DOC_DIR): Update to new doc location
	as per Hammond's e-mail of 2006-12-14.

2006-12-12  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.conf: Set the gdb history file to be left only in $HOME instead
	of $cwd (which results in .gdb_history files scattered all over).
	Remove lines listing a number of obsolete plugins so as to not
	confuse the unwary.

2006-10-25  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (CDEBUGFLAGS): Raise the debug info level to -g3 so we
	get macro definitions included in the debug info.

2006-10-04  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.plist: New file with the Open Source Versions plist information
	for the Apple gdb sources.
	* gdb.txt: New file with a copy of gdb's copyright terms.
	* Makefile: Install them in /usr/local.

2006-07-13  Stan Shebs  <shebs@apple.com>

	* Rename libinf to libcheckpoint.
 
2006-07-13  Stan Shebs  <shebs@apple.com>

	* libinf: New directory for dylib with functions loaded
	into the inferior on demand.
	* Makefile (install-libinf): New target.
	(install-macosx): Add it.

2006-05-02  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Default to building with -gdwarf-2.
	(install-gdb-macosx, install-gdb-fat): Create dSYM files,
	strip the binaries that are left in SYMROOT.

2006-05-01  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Unset the DYLD_* env vars before invoking gdb;
	dyld-60 and later issue a warning when a setgid program is invoked
	and these env vars are not honored by dyld.  
	* Makefile (check): Properly quote filename check so that multiple
	matches don't yield a shell error.

2006-04-18  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Don't remove the symroot between phases.

2006-04-17  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Make installed MacsBug plugin setgid procmod.

2006-04-17  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: If the parent process is "CodeWarrior", invoke
	gdb-for-codewarrior.

2006-03-10 Stacey Pang	(stacey_pang@apple.com)
	Adding some nice finishing touches on a few more files in gdb/bin
	* start_tests - now moves aside useless test directories
	* lib/TestHelper.pm - configure process has been simplified so
	  users no longer need a .dejagnurc file to make this work -
	  this should be helpful if the compiler group wants to run our
	  tests because they have their own dejagnu harness and .dejagnurc
	  files.  
	* lib/tools/ignore_tests - removed my directory so this script can
	  now be run by anyone no matter where it's installed.  
	  Note: This isn't perfect ... it still requires manually mucking
	  with the testsuite/configure script once per check-in to work.  
	  But it's the best solution at the moment.  
	* README - describes all of these things.  

2006-03-09 Stacey Pang	(stacey_pang@apple.com)
	Re-structuring gdb/bin diretory:
	- README file in gdb/bin has been updated to reflect these changes.
	- User modifiable config info and libraries are now separate from
	main testing scripts
	- Main testing scripts can now find the libaries and tools they
	need even if gdb/bin directory is relocated.  This means anyone
	should now be able to use the main testing scripts without
	modification:  
	* getInfo [-tools|-sys]        print software versions
	* mv_logs                      move log files around
	* report                       analyze and compare log files.  
	* start_tests                  create,configure test directories
				       and/or run tests.  

2006-02-21 Stacey Pang	(stacey_pang@apple.com)
	* Adding gdb/bin directory which contains several automated testing
	  scripts.  

2006-01-31  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Remove a bunch of unused sections of the Makefile.

2006-01-24  Stan Shebs  <shebs@apple.com>

	* Makefile (GDB_VERSION): Update.

2005-12-16  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (CDEBUGFLAGS): Drop -mdynamic-no-pic for now; libintl
	builds in a way that requires the relocations to be present even
	though only a .a file is finally generated.

2005-12-16  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Remove references to mmalloc.

2005-12-16  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Pass the GDB_RC_VERSION separately to the gdb 
	submake.
	
2005-12-01  Ronnie Misra (rgmisra@apple.com)

        * gdb.sh: Update to recognize new translate program path/command 
        line parameter.

2005-11-09  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh (oah750_binary): Add "-execOAH" command line parameter
	when invoking oah750 so it knows to leave our procmod setgid 
	permissions in tact.

2005-10-19  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

        * gdb.sh: Copy DYLD_* into GDB_DYLD_* to get past the setgid barrier.

2005-09-30  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

        * Makefile: make the gdb binaries setgid procmod.

2005-06-07  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (GDB_RC_VERSION): Bump to 450.  Tumeric will be
	in the 420-449 range.

2005-05-28  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Update --help text.

2005-05-18  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* cache-symfiles.sh: Remove.
	* Makefile: Don't install cache-symfiles.sh.

2005-05-03  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Add --oah750 command line option.

2005-04-14  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* gdb.sh: Add a -arch command line option.

2005-01-18  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (GDB_VERSION): Update to the last merge.

2004-12-06  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Info-template.plist: It looks like CFBundleDevelopmentRegion needs
	to be defined; whatever.  Looking at two installed frameworks I see 
	English is an acceptable setting, so there we go.  These are just 
	private framework header files used for building gdb plug-ins anyway.

2004-08-09  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Post-process the man page to refer to
	$(SYSTEM_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_DOC_DIR) instead of hard-coding (see
	change to gdb/gdb.1).

2004-06-16  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* ntbuild.sh, ntconfig.sh: Removed.
	* dpkg/control: Removed.
	* ChangeLog.binutils: Removed.

2004-06-16  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Don't install binutils, unnecessary frameworks.
	Don't create /usr/lib, /usr/libexec/binutils directories.

2004-06-11  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Quote documentation directory pathnames in case
	a space character is added.

2004-06-08  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

        * cache-symfiles.sh: For now, don't emit cached symfiles
        if the original library has any stabs.  gdb crashes when
        these are present (Radar 3418798)
        Also deleted the setting of "name" in the second (library)
        search, since we don't actually use it.
	Also, run the script far enough to delete the old symfile
	directory, since then gdb won't bother to look at a bunch
	of symfiles which it surely can't use.
	
2004-06-08  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (SYSTEM_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_DOC_DIR): Set from
	pb_makefiles' plaform-variables.make if possible. 

2004-06-07  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Move GDB_RC_VERSION up where I can see it.
	(SYSTEM_DEVELOPER_TOOLS_DOC_DIR): New variable to hold the location
	of the installed documentation, cf r. 3678942.
	(install-binutils-common): Don't install binutils docs.
	(install-binutils-macosx): Don't install binutils docs.
	(install-chmod-macosx): Update chmod call to avoid deprecation warning.

2004-05-17  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile: Bump GDB_RC_VERSION to new range.

2004-05-13  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* cached-symfiles.sh: Suppress cacheing of symfiles until Klee
	has a chance to make it work again in the newly merged sources.

2003-10-03  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

        * cache-symfiles.sh: Run nm on dylibs to ensure they're well formed
        before feeding them to gdb.

2003-07-24  Klee Dienes <kdienes@apple.com>

	* cache-symfiles.sh: Use the proper prefix for dyld; no longer
	remove the dyld.syms from the cached symfile directory.

2003-05-04  Klee Dienes <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Use GDB_RC_VERSION instead of APPLE_VERSION in the
	gdb.sh target.  Use GDB_FRAMEWORKS and BINUTILS_FRAMEWORKS instead
	of FRAMEWORKS in the install target.

2003-05-04  Klee Dienes <kdienes@apple.com>

	* cache-symfiles.sh: Use the correct path to GDB.  Don't read the
	user's .gdbinit.  Check for dangling symlinks in /usr/lib.

2003-04-24  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Don't chmod the dylds if you aren't doing 
	--enable-shared.
	Also change the version string to 268.
	
2003-04-25  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* cache-symfiles.sh: Update to use the new cached-symfile
	creation commands.

2003-03-18  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* Makefile (GDB_VERSION): Updated date string to most recent
	merge.
	(CONFIG_OTHER_OPTIONS): Add --disable-serial-configure.  Not
	exactly sure what is up with this, but buildit fails without
	it -- somehow configure-liberty is being triggered from the
	"configure-gdb" target and the build fails because libiberty
	isn't included in the sources.

2003-01-14  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Update to use the top-level configure, and then run
	make configure-gdb.  Build intl and readline for each
	cross-compiled platform, rather than re-using the native build.
	
2002-12-12  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* cache-symfiles.sh: Test each potential framework for validity,
	rather than by using an explicit list of invalid framework.
	* configure: Update to configure the needed subdirectories (they
	are no longer automatically configured by the top-level
	configure).  Remove __objcInit removal code (it's removed by the
	GDB makefile).
	
2002-10-28  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Remove PDO support.  Convert "rhapsody" to "macosx".
	Remove obsolete Mac OS X release names.  Use *-apple-darwin
	instead of *-apple-macos10 as the primary build string.  Remove
	WITH_CFM and WITH_PTHREADS options.  Pass location for
	libintl.dylib.
	* gdb.sh: Convert *-apple-macos10 to *-apple-darwin.
	* template.h: Convert *-apple-macos10 to *-apple-darwin.  Remove
	Rhapsody support.
	* macsbug/Makefile: Convert *-apple-macos10 to *-apple-darwin.
	* macsbug/build.sh: Remove.
	
2002-09-24  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* Makefile: Update version number.
	* Makefile: Add *-macosx-darwin to the list of recognized arch strings.
	* Makefile: Strip trailing and leading spaces from CFLAGS.

	* template.h: include machine/sys--sys/file, not sys--sys/file.
