2005-02-21  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

        * mi-main.c (mi_cmd_file_fix_file_is_grooved): New MI command to
        show whether Fix and Continue is supported with the current
        executable or not.
        * mi-cmds.h: Prototype for above.

2005-02-17  Jim Ingham <jingham@apple.com>

	* mi-out.c (mi_notify_begin): Store away the whole uiout data,
	not just the buffer.  This way we will start with a clean state
	for any lists we make in the notify.
	(mi_notify_end): restore the state.
	
2005-02-10  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* mi-main.c (mi_cmd_thread_set_pc): New thread-set-pc behavior:
	if setting the PC to a function prologue, advance it out of the
	prologue.  Can be defeated with the -n command option.

2005-01-28  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* mi-cmd-stack.c (mi_cmd_file_list_globals): Use the
	enum return value from objfile_matches_name.

	mi interpreter's uiout.
	
2004-10-28  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* mi-cmd-break.c (mi_cmd_break_insert): Added the "-l"
	option, and process it.
	
2004-10-08  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* mi-cmds-file.c (print_syms_for_block): New consts argument.
	Change all uses of print_syms_for_block to pass this.

	running.
	* mi-main.c: (mi_cmd_pid_info): New function.
	* (mi_command_completes_while_target_executing): Add 
	pid-info to the list of commands that can be run while the

	* mi-cmd-break.c (mi_cmd_break_insert): realpath() the shlib
	argument so it matches what we get (& realpath) from dyld if
        the argument looks like an absolute pathname.

2004-09-28  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* mi-main.c (mi_execute_async_cli_command): Don't use the
	exec_cleanup_chain for freeing the command string.  That can
	be done right after the safe_execute_command, do a normal
	cleanup is just fine.  And the exec_cleanup_chain is pretty
	fragile.
	
2004-09-23  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* mi-cmds.h: Prototype for file-fix-file MI func.
	* mi-cmds.c (mi_cmds): Use MI function for file-fix-file instead

2004-09-07  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* mi-interp.c (_initialize_mi_interp): Set the "mi" interpreter
	back to mi0.  CodeWarrior 9 requires mi0, but asks for just "mi".

2004-09-07  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* mi-cmd-break.c (mi_cmd_break_insert): If 'ignore' argument

2004-09-02  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* mi-main.h (mi_interp_query_hook): This func is now static; do not

	* mi-main.c (mi_cmd_thread_set_pc): Split apart filename and line
	number manually instead of using decode_line_1.  Add appropriate
        error checking to catch bad filenames/line #'s.  Correct CORE_ADDR
        printing to work for both 32 and 64 bit addrs.

2004-06-14  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* mi-main.c (mi_cmd_thread_set_pc): Restore call to 
	update_picbase_register().

2004-05-27  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* mi-cmd-stack.c (mi_cmd_file_list_statics): Not being able to
	find a symtab for the CURRENT_FRAME_COOKIE, or for a "" filename
	should just return an empty list, not an error.
	
2004-05-25  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

        * mi-cmd-break.c (mi_cmd_break_catch): Return from unsetting
        the catchpoints rather than continuing on to set new ones (doh!)

2004-05-18  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

        * mi-cmd-stack.c (mi_cmd_file_list_statics): Added the
        "*CURRENT FRAME*" cookie.

        of values and create_varobj, and use enum print_frame.
        * (mi_cmd_stack_list_locals): Use mi_decode_print_values instead
        of decoding by hand.
        * (mi_cmd_stack_list_args): ditto.
        * mi-cmds.h: Add the ftype's for the new commands.
        * mi-cmds.c: And add them to the command array.

2004-05-05  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

        * mi-cmds.c (mi_cmds): Route -exec-abort MI command to CLI's "kill".

2004-04-29  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* mi-cmd-var.c (mi_cmd_var_list_children): Rework to integrate
	our expected var-list-children command behavior with the new
	FSF command behavior, where we have multiple potential ways to
	express "show me the values of the child".

2004-04-28  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* mi-cmd-stack.c (mi_print_frame_info_lite): Each frame is a

	return command changes the stack.
	(mi_remove_notify_hooks): Remove "stack_changed.

2003-10-22  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	to the number of lines specified in by the -n argument.

2003-10-15  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>
	
	* mi-cmd-break.c: (mi_cmd_break_insert): Handle the "-s" option

        and current default breakpoint location after moving the pc.

2003-08-08  Jim Ingham (jingham@apple.com)

	* mi-main.c (mi_execute_async_cli_command): Use 
	safe_execute_command not execute_command so we can discard
	the async callbacks if we get an error.

2003-06-10  Jim Ingham (jingham@apple.com)

	* mi-main.c (mi_cmd_thread_set_pc): Check both old_fun and
	new_fun to make sure they aren't null before testing to see
	whether they are the same.

2003-06-01  Jim Ingham (jingham@apple.com)

	* mi-main.c (mi_cmd_data_assign): Lock the scheduler when we 
	run evaluate expression in case the evaluation calls functions.

	the pc so we will continue over breakpoints properly.

2003-05-06  Jim Ingham (jingham@apple.com)

	* mi-cmd-var.c (prepare_tmp_mi_out): Set up the tmp_mi_out if that
	hasn't been done already (or if someone has switched the mi interpreter).
	(mi_cmd_var_create): Use the tmp_miout to suppress output from varobj_create
	in case the creation calls crash.

2003-05-02  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* mi-main.c (mi_cmd_thread_set_pc): When -thread-set-pc is being
	used to jump from an obsolete function to a new function, update
	the pic base register with a correct value.

2003-05-01  Jim Ingham (jingham@apple.com)

	* mi-cmd-var.c (mi_cmd_var_create): Make the "+" style variable
	actually work.
	(mi_report_var_creation): Report the block start & block end.
	(mi_cmd_var_info_block): Report both line number & address, and use

	(mi_cmd_var_update): Initialize the tmp_miout if needed.
	(varobj_update_one): Swap in the tmp_miout before running
	varobj_update so we don't dump "reason" messages into the changelist
	if the varobj has a function & the call crashes.

	* mi-main.c (mi_cmd_thread_set_pc): Return the new FP and PC.

2003-04-30  Jim Ingham (jingham@apple.com)

	* mi-main.c (mi_cmd_thread_set_pc): Have to reselect the current
	frame, since flush_cached_frame leaves it NULL, but the register
	printing code throws an internal_error if this is not set.

2003-04-24  Jim Ingham (jingham@apple.com)

	* mi-main.c (mi_cmd_thread_set_pc): Just test that the function name
	matches, not full function symbol, for "moving to another function".
	Fix & Continue moves to a different function with the same name, and we
	don't want an error in that case.

2003-04-23  Jim Ingham (jingham@apple.com)

	* mi-cmd-stack.c (mi_interp_stack_changed_hook): Use
	gdb_interpreter_ui_out instead of grubbing around in
	the interpreter structure directly.
	(mi_interp_frame_changed_hook): Ditto.
	(mi_interp_context_hook): Ditto.

	* mi-main.c (mi_cmd_thread_set_pc): New function, sets the

	(output_async_notification): New function.
	(output_control_change_notification): Route these notifications
	through the mi (since the console-quoted may be in force and we don't
	want to end up quoting the notifications.
	(mi_interp_read_one_line_hook): Use output_async_notification.
	(mi_interp_run_command_hook): Ditto.
	(mi_cmd_interpreter_exec): Treat console & console-quoted as the
	same for running the target.

2003-04-17  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* mi-cmd-var.c (mi_cmd_var_evaluate_expression): Only change
	unwindonsignal setting if -u parameter is passed.
	* mi-main.c (mi_cmd_data_evaluate_expression): Ditto.

2003-03-25  Jim Ingham  (jingham@apple.com)

	A final detail from the 2003-03-18 changes. We need to make
	sure that the mi async continuation doesn't blow away - or
	get out of order with - an exec continuation registered by
	another function. The finish continuation is a prime example.
	
	* mi-main.c (captured_mi_execute_command): Changed context to
	parse, since we should call the same variable the same thing if
	possible.
	
	(mi_execute_async_cli_command): The continuation has to be
	registered BEFORE the command is executed to keep the order right.
	If the command doesn't run, then discard it.  Also store the head
	of the cleanup chain so that our continuation will only clean up
	back to there.
	(mi_exec_async_cli_cmd_continuation): ditto.
	(mi_interpreter_exec_continuation): ditto.
	(setup_continuation_arg): manage the cleanup as well.
	
2003-03-18  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* mi-cmds.c (mi_cmds): Add entry for "file-fix-file".

2003-03-18  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	This set of changes adds a feature - mi command timings, and
	reworks how the command token is stored away for asynchronous
	commands - by storing it in the continuation argument rather
	than trying to pass it around in globals behind the command's
	backs.

	* mi-cmds.{c,h}: add administrative bits for mi-enable-timings.
	* mi-main.c (mi_cmd_enable_timings): New function .
	* (mi_command_completes_while_target_executing): New function.
	* (mi_interpreter_exec_bp_cmd): New function.
	* (setup_continuation_arg): New function.
	* (free_continuation_arg): New function.
	* (timestamp): New function.
	* (print_diff_now): New function.
	* (copy_timestamp): New function.
	* (print_diff): New function.
	* (wallclock_diff): New function.
	* (user_diff): New function.
	* (system_diff): New function.
	* (mi_cmd_exec_interrupt): Don't fiddle with the command tokens,
	just print your completion message.
	* (mi_cmd_exec_status): ditto.
	* (mi_cmd_target_select): The rewind & "\n" are taken care of by
	captured_mi_execute_command now.
	* (captured_mi_execute_command): print timing differences.  Also
	handle the rewind & "\n" for MI_CMD_QUIET commands to reduce code
	duplication.
	* (mi_execute_command): remove redundant gdb_flush.
	* (mi_cmd_execute): Handle passing the token & timestamp to the lower
	layers through current_command_ts & current_command_token.
	* (mi_execute_async_cli_command): If the command set the target running
	pass the token and timestamp to the continuation.  Also segregate the
	asyn & non-async cases totally.  They only shared one line - execute_command
	and splitting on that made the code hard to read.
	* (mi_cmd_interpreter_exec): ditto.  Also don't reschedule continuation
	if run from mi_interpreter_exec_bp_cmd.
	* (mi_execute_async_cli_command_continuation): Handle printing the timestamp, also
	if the target is again set running, make a new timestamp and forward
	it to the new continuation.
	* (mi_interpreter_exec_continuation): ditto.
	* (_mi_initialize): Add a gdb "set" variable controling the timing
	so people can turn it on and off in their .gdbinit.
	* mi-parse.h: Define struct mi_timestamp, add it to mi_parse.
	* mi-parse.c(mi_parse_free): Cleanup cmd_timestamp from mi_parse.
	
2003-03-03  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* mi-cmd-break.c (mi_cmd_break_catch): Implement the -break-catch
	command.
	* mi-cmds.c: Add mi_cmd_break_catch to the commands table.
	* mi-cmds.h: And define the ftype for mi_cmd_break_catch.

2003-02-03  Jim Ingham  <jingham@apple.com>

	* mi-cmd-var.c (mi_report_var_creation): add another argument,
	is_root, and subsume all variable reporting into this function.
	That way we can preserve the old reporting order (and not give
	the testsuite heartburn).

2003-01-23  Jim Ingham   <jingham@apple.com>

	* mi-cmds.c: Add record for exec-status command.
	* mi-cmds.h: Add declaration for mi_cmd_exec_status.
	* mi-main.c (mi_cmd_exec_status): New function, return
	the current state of the inferior.
	(mi_execute_command): Use the return code that the
	command actually returned (args.rc).
	(mi_cmd_execute): Allow exec-status while the inferior
	is running.

2003-01-21  Jim Ingham   <jingham@apple.com>

        * mi-cmd-var.c (mi_report_var_creation): Take out the in_scope
        part, so this will work for both parent & child variables.
        (mi_cmd_var_create): Add back in the in_scope.
        (mi_cmd_var_list_children): Use mi_report_var_creation rather
        than replicating most of the code here.

2002-12-16  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* mi-main.c (mi_command_loop): Take MI version arg, as per the
	current FSF sources.
	(mi0_command_loop, mi1_command_loop, mi2_command_loop): Call
	mi_command_loop() with the correct MI version, as per the FSF srcs.
	(mi_interpreter_resume): Assign the correct MI version command
	loop based on DATA, the stored cookie containing mi_version.

2002-12-12  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* mi-cmd-stack.c (mi_cmd_stack_list_frames_lite): Fix typo.

2002-12-11  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* mi-cmd-stack.c (mi_cmd_stack_list_frames_lite): Update argument
	parsing.  Pass 'unlimited' for the COUNT_LIMIT to
	FAST_COUNT_STACK_DEPTH.
	(mi_cmd_stack_info_depth): Update to the new call for
	FAST_COUNT_STACK_DEPTH.

2002-12-07  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* mi-cmd-stack.c (mi_cmd_stack_list_frames_lite): Replace
	FRAME_FP with get_frame_base.

2002-11-21  Klee Dienes  <kdienes@apple.com>

	* mi-main.c (miunspec_interp): Contains what used to be mi_interp.
	(mi_interp) Renamed to miunspec_interp.  mi_interp is now a
	generic pointer that points to the MI interpreter being used
	during an MI context callback.
	(_initialize_main): Create miunspec_interp.  Set the MI value for
	mi2_interp to '2'.
	(mi_cmd_interpreter_exec): Set mi_interp to the current MI
	interpreter for the duration of the inferior-exec call.

2002-10-30  Jim Ingham   <jingham@apple.com>

	Changes to allow varobjs to follow the C++ dynamic type.
	
	* mi-cmd-var.c (mi_report_var_creation, mi_var_list_children):
	report dynamic_type.
	* (varobj_update_one): Handle the case where a child changes its
	dynamic type.  Report this, and delete the children.  Also use the
	new varobj_update interface.

	Other little cleanups:
	
	* mi-cmd-var.c (mi_report_var_creation, mi_var_list_children,
	mi_var_info_type): free the type strings, these are malloc'ed
	copies that we are handed, these are ui_file_xstrdup'ed, and must
	be freed.
	
	* (mi_cmd_var_list_children): Handle the case of no arguments (used
	to crash).
	
2002-10-30  Klee Dienes <kdienes@apple.com>

	* mi-main.c (mi_cmd_exec_interrupt): Replace call to
	interrupt_target_command with an explicit SIGINT to the inferior
	(this seems a bit hackish, but just code that was accidentally
	misplaced in a source merge, so for now I'm just re-adding it
	as-is).

2002-10-25  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* mi-cmd-var.c (mi_cmd_var_list_children): CHILDREN is a list,
	not a tuple.
	(mi_cmd_var_update): CHANGELIST is a list, not a tuple (this is a
	mi2 vs mi1 difference at the FSF, but I don't want to waste time
	supporting the broken mi1 behavior locally).
	(varobj_update_one): VAROBJ is a named tuple, not an anonymous one
	like the FSF.

	* mi-cmd-stack.c (print_syms_for_block): Each
	variable/varobj/variable+value are printed in their own
	anonymous tuples (not a list).

	* mi-cmd-disas.c (mi_cmd_disassemble): Hack around broken find_line_pc
	replacement.
	
2002-10-24  Jason Molenda  (jmolenda@apple.com)

	* mi-cmd-stack.c (mi_cmd_stack_info_depth): Pass non-zero limit to
	FAST_COUNT_STACK_DEPTH to indicate a specified limit, or 0 for

	varobj's for the args or locals and return those as part of the
	result.  Also add a flag to list locals for ALL blocks in the
	current function.
	(print_syms_for_block): This is where the work to implement the 
	varobj creation is done.
	(mi_cmd_stack_list_args): Change the argument parsing to accept the
	SHOW_VALUE argument = 2, which means create the varobj as well.

	if the type has changed.

	* mi-main.c (mi_exec_async_cli_cmd_continuation): Do a gdb_flush
	after continuation output, otherwise this won't show up when
	you are not using a line-buffered device.

	version of the typecode as well.
	(print_typecode): New function - stringifies the enum typecode.
	(mi_cmd_var_update): Allow this to take a list of varobj's to update.
	(varobj_update_one): Output the varobj's as a list of lists, where 
	each varobj gets its own label.  This makes the output easier to 
	parse.

	and change use of list_args_or_locals accordingly.
	(mi_cmd_stack_list_args): Add new argument for 
	list_args_or_locals.
