<H1><A NAME="SEC1" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC1">Summary of GDB</A></H1>

<P>
The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow you to see
what is going on "inside" another program while it executes--or what
another program was doing at the moment it crashed.  We call the other
program "your program," or "the program being debugged."

</P>
<P>
GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of
these) to help you catch bugs in the act:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.

<LI>

Make your program stop on specified conditions.

<LI>

Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.

<LI>

Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the
effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.
</UL>

<P>
You can use GDB to debug programs written in C and C++.
For more information, see section <A HREF="gdb_10.html#SEC72">Supported languages</A>.
For more information, see section <A HREF="gdb_10.html#SEC73">C and C++</A>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>
Support for Modula-2 and Chill is partial.  For information on Modula-2,
see section <A HREF="gdb_10.html#SEC81">Modula-2</A>.  For information on Chill, see section <A HREF="gdb_10.html#SEC90">Chill</A>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX3"></A>
Debugging Pascal programs which use sets, subranges, file variables, or
nested functions does not currently work.  GDB does not support
entering expressions, printing values, or similar features using Pascal
syntax.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
GDB can be used to debug programs written in Fortran, although
It may be necessary to refer to some variables with a trailing
underscore.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
GDB can be used to debug programs written in Objective-C and in
Objective-C++, using either the Apple/NeXT or the GNU Objective-C
runtime.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC2">Free software</A></H2>

<P>
GDB is <STRONG>free software</STRONG>, protected by the GNU 
General Public License
(GPL).  The GPL gives you the freedom to copy or adapt a licensed
program--but every person getting a copy also gets with it the
freedom to modify that copy (which means that they must get access to
the source code), and the freedom to distribute further copies.
Typical software companies use copyrights to limit your freedoms; the
Free Software Foundation uses the GPL to preserve these freedoms.

</P>
<P>
Fundamentally, the General Public License is a license which says that
you have these freedoms and that you cannot take these freedoms away
from anyone else.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="gdb_toc.html#TOC3">Contributors to GDB</A></H2>

<P>
Richard Stallman was the original author of GDB, and of many other
GNU programs.  Many others have contributed to its development.
This section attempts to credit major contributors.  One of the virtues
of free software is that everyone is free to contribute to it; with
regret, we cannot actually acknowledge everyone here.  The file
<TT>`ChangeLog'</TT> in the GDB distribution approximates a
blow-by-blow account.

</P>
<P>
Changes much prior to version 2.0 are lost in the mists of time.

</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Plea:</EM> Additions to this section are particularly welcome.  If you
or your friends (or enemies, to be evenhanded) have been unfairly
omitted from this list, we would like to add your names!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
So that they may not regard their many labors as thankless, we
particularly thank those who shepherded GDB through major
releases:
