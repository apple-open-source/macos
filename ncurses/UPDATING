Minimum steps required:

1.) Update the dev/UPSTREAM branch
2.) Apply the diff from the new commit on dev/UPSTREAM to ncurses/ in the
    release branch.
3.) If the cchar_t/WINDOW ABI changes again, the NCURSES_MAX_ABI in
    curses.priv.h will need bumped.
4.) *New* libncurses symbols need NCURSES_ABI_PUSH()/NCURSES_ABI_POP() with the
    maximum supported ABI at the time (see NCURSES_MAX_ABI in curses.priv.h)
5.) *Old* libncurses symbols that are affected by any ABI change need an
    implementation in nc_abi.c for the new version.  generate-syms.py will take
    care of this, the current_abi_version at the top of the script will need
    bumped to the new version accordingly.  Any filters for symbols unaffected
    by the update may be added to generate-syms.filters.  generate-syms.py
    should ideally be run by simply executing the top-level configure.sh, which
    will also regenerate the relevant curses headers.
