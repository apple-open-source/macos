	Change History (most recent first):

	  <DV86>	 3/16/00	SF		[2438610] Put 1-second delay before checking camera
									configuration.
	  <DV85>	 2/14/00	CK		[2432944]  A little more to kill this bug <sf,cp>
	  <DV84>	 2/10/00	SF		[2432944] Add retries to bandwidth/channel allocations.
	  <DV83>	 12/7/99	jkl		Changed isocMedia to isochMedia.
	  <DV82>	 11/1/99	jkl		Added useCMP atom for turning on and off CMP. Moved CMP from
									device specific to global. Moved the check for useCMP in the
									resource to global allocate time. Changed CMPWrite to update the
									expectedValue after each attempt to try to make it succeed. Some
									time the Canon camera arbitrarily fails on this. This needs to
									be redone so the entire operation can make sure the values are
									correct.
	  <DV81>	10/25/99	KW		If an error occurs during one of the calls to FSL during
									cmpResetStage1..9, set the reset stage to kNoResetsProcessing.
									This ensures that the next bus reset will be processed.
	  <DV80>	10/22/99	KW		In updateDeviceList, do not zero out localFWReferenceID when a
									device is removed. Zeroing out the localFWReferenceID causes the
									cmp bus reset routines to stop propogating. In doAVCTransaction
									deallocated the command object in the event of an error.
	  <DV79>	 9/28/99	KW		In IDHRead and IDHWrite, do not tear down read/write
									notification if an error occurs.
	  <DV78>	 9/21/99	jkl		Backed out this read/write postEvent deferred stuff. A
									stack-based variable was killing it and it needs more analysis.
	  <DV77>	 9/20/99	jkl		Really made the previous change. The DVFamilyLib postEvent was
									commented as meaning to defer the rest of the read/write
									complete notification to another deferred task, but was calling
									CallSecondaryInterruptHandler2 to do it. Since the postEvents
									for the read/write complete are already at deferred task, this
									call basically did nothing. Now QueueSecondaryInterruptHandler
									is used which definitely postpones the completion of postEvent
									to another deferred task. This is now much more of a risky
									change.
		<76>	 9/17/99	jkl		Changed isoch read/write complete notification callProcs to be
									called in another SIH.
		<75>	 8/29/99	RS		Fixed problem with unfriendly clients who wouldn't cancel their
									notifications before closing the isoch component. This could
									cause a crash if we callback and the client isn't there anymore.

		<74>	 8/28/99	KW		Dispose of all clients signed up for notifications when last
									instance is closed. Fixes crashes for hot plugging.
		<73>	 8/17/99	jkl		Changed CMP check to look for file type of INIT instead of gdfx.
		<72>	 8/16/99	RS		Added isoch version atom to device list.
		<71>	 8/16/99	jkl		Changed useCMP function to be off by default and look for a
									'ucmp' resource id -20756 before using CMP. FireWire 2.2 or
									greater check is still there.
		<70>	 8/16/99	jkl		Replicated a default DV name atom property in old name property
									location. Moved the bus reset notification proc with FireWire to
									only be active during the isoch read and write. This makes sure
									an instance is always open with the call proc address valid.
		<69>	 8/12/99	jkl		Bracketed the name QTCopyAtomToPtr with lock/unlock container
									calls.
		<68>	 8/10/99	jkl		Added camera name updating routine.
		<67>	  8/9/99	RS		Added IDHUpdateDeviceList() to API. The client can now change
									r/w atoms in the internal device list. This currently includes
									device name. Completed the bus reset generated IDHDeviceChanged
									notification. The client can now be notified at interrupt time
									whether a device state has been changed.
		<66>	  8/9/99	jkl		Added handleBusReset call proc for interrupt level bus reset
									notification.
		<65>	  8/9/99	jkl		Added some camera name stuff. Moved the name atom to be a direct
									child of the device atom. Default name is DV, if a name has been
									entered for the device then use it, else if the vendor is known
									then name is "vendor name DV".
		<64>	  8/6/99	jkl		More work to get rid of DVFamily.h. Added defines for
									getDeviceStandard AVC transaction. Also changed default camera
									name to DV and left off standard.
		<63>	  8/6/99	jkl		Changed kNTSCStandard to be ntscIn from QTComponents.h.
		<62>	  8/3/99	RS		Properly handling device disconnect by propogating errors to
									client(s).
		<61>	 7/29/99	jkl		Set input channel when camera is listener during bus reset
									handling. Some cameras do not follow the spec. Made sure to set
									bus reset processing state to noProcessing after bus reset
									processing has been interrupted.
		<60>	 7/28/99	jkl		Added all of the bus reset stages for CMP. Still not robust
									enough to handle errors during bus reset. Added Gestalt check
									for FireWire 2.2 or greater. CMP does not run if this check
									fails, allowing HaveBlue to run on FireWire 2.1.
		<59>	 7/28/99	jkl		Changed FWRegisterDriver to use the device description instead
									of driver refNum for client specific data. This lets the bus
									reset handling get the device description. Nobody was using the
									refNum. Turned on bus reset management.
		<58>	 7/28/99	jkl		Moved isochPortCommandObject and asynchCommandObject allocation
									to updateDeviceList, device added routine. Set max payload for
									asynch command object to 512. Changed all of the cmp routines to
									use the already allocated asynch command object. Changed local
									pcrBuffer modifications to always use FWRead and
									FWCompareAndSwap. Reduced overhead ID from 14 to 12.
		<57>	 7/23/99	jkl		Turned off CMP bus reset handling.
		<56>	 7/22/99	jkl		CMP, added correct speed, bandwidth, and overheadID calculations
									and configuration to manage reconnections after bus reset.
		<55>	 7/20/99	jkl		Fixed CMP bug where device not broadcasting could look
									connected. Turned off broadcast bit to disconnect plug before
									changing channel on a device only broadcasting. Sony is not
									going to like this but it solves compatibility problems and
									strictly follows the spec.
		<54>	 7/20/99	jkl		Turned CMP on. Can create a file in Preferences folder called
									"no cmp" to disable CMP.
		<53>	 7/18/99	jkl		Fixed command object allocation in irmAllocateBandwidth. Fixed
									initial overhead ID value for output plug control register.
		<52>	 7/16/99	jkl		Added latest CMP code.
		<51>	 7/16/99	KW		Moved FireWire callbacks to here. Register all devices with
									FireWire that have ever been seen when the first isoch component
									is opened. Likewise, Unregister all devices when the last isoch
									component is closed. Ensure that the device notification ID for
									a device is zeroed out after the notification has been disposed
									of.
		<50>	 7/14/99	jkl		Fixed dclProgramID mistake.
		<49>	 7/14/99	jkl		Made sure isochPortCommandObjects are allocated safely and not
									prematurely deallocated. Made sure disable read and write are
									safe if extraneous calls are made to them.
		<48>	 7/13/99	jkl		Reverted to previous version. Added fix for device control
									getTimeCode failing after hot plug.
		<47>	 7/12/99	jkl		Added a bunch of CMP stuff. Almost ready to turn on.
		<46>	 7/12/99	RS		Changed component instance storage from system heap to
									application heap to work around misbehaved apps that don't
									CloseComponent.
		<45>	 7/10/99	RS		Added notification for device added/removed so that we can
									update the fwClientID in the device control component if the
									camera is removed then re-added.
		<44>	  7/8/99	RS		Fixed problem where the device control instance was being
									prematurely released before all of the clients were finished.
	  <OX43>	  7/7/99	SW		Just removed some unused variables to stop compiler warnings.
		<42>	  7/7/99	jkl		Cleared driverRefNum and fwClientID fields on device removed,
									and updated them on device added for an already known device.
									Also updated localFWReferenceID in case the same camera is
									plugged into a different FireWire interface on the machine.
		<41>	  7/5/99	jkl		Added SetMaxPayload for client.
		<40>	  7/2/99	RS		Replaced event recording with logger to increase debug
									capability.
		<39>	  7/1/99	RS		Passing actual device description pointer instead of client
									instance to isoch callbacks since the client can change deviceID
									behind our back.
		<38>	 6/30/99	RS		Fixed error codes returned in certain functions. Removed
									openDeviceConnection() function because it is no long needed.
									Fixed bug with device name atom. Fixed bug where we were
									disabling read/writes in Close() if device was already possibly
									disabled.
		<37>	 6/28/99	RS		Moved IDHGetClientID from public to private call. Added
									kIDHErrDeviceTimeout errors for sync read/writes timeouts.
									Created public structs for IDHDimension and IDHResolution. Added
									deviceID to atom tree.
		<36>	 6/28/99	RS		Moved open device control from OpenDevice to SetConfig so that
									client doesn't have to Open a device for read/write in order to
									device control. Added device enable/disable notification.
									Returning error on getConfig if no previous setConfig.
		<35>	 6/27/99	jkl		Added default to NTSC in getDeviceStandard for devices that may
									not have any device control capability.
		<34>	 6/26/99	jkl		Integrated Richard's, Kevin's, and my changes to get read and
									write working. Wired clock back up. Too much other stuff to
									mention. Compare revisions if you really want to know.
		<33>	 6/24/99	RS		Added the DVCWriteFrame() and DVGetNextEmptyFrame() equivalent.
									We think all of the plumbing is in. So let the fun debug begin.
		<32>	 6/24/99	KW		Not ready for prime time but things compile. Errors exist.
		<31>	 6/24/99	jkl		Yanked all of the DV driver code into here. Some fun.
	  <OX30>	 6/22/99	SW		Add support for private calls to the IDH DV component instead of
									just using morphed GetDeviceStatus() calls.
		<29>	 6/21/99	RS		Added timeouts to synchronous reads and writes. The timeout has
									initially been set to 1/15 second (2 frame times).
		<28>	 6/20/99	RS		Moved device atom to device description structure to correctly
									handle device added/removed issues. Added PAL audio format
									config. Initialize device atom seed to 1. More cleanup.
		<27>	 6/19/99	RS		Removed getting connectionID in IDHGetDeviceStatus (not needed).
		<26>	 6/19/99	RS		Added deviceAtom and device standard to device description
									structure. Allocating correct buffer size according to camera
									format (ntsc or pal). Fixed bug where deviceID could change with
									last connection going to zero (BAD). Alot of general cleanup.
		<25>	 6/18/99	RS		Added kIDHUniqueIDType to device atom tree. Added some auxillary
									functions to help traverse atom list.
		<24>	 6/18/99	GDW		Made device control component handling global verses per
									instance.
		<23>	 6/18/99	GDW		Made some changes for additional device control component.
		<22>	 6/17/99	RS		Made some changes to open and close device to handle device
									access a little more gracefully.
		<21>	 6/17/99	RS		Added FWClientID to device descriptor for device control. Fixed
									bug when groing from write to read mode on a camera. Buffers
									weren't being allocated.
		<20>	 6/17/99	jkl		Added fwClientID to DVGetLocalFWReferenceID call to make the
									fwClientID part of the device info so IDH can execute
									getDeviceStandard by itself.
		<19>	 6/16/99	RS		Added Firewire Node ID to device structure. Added AVC
									transaction code to isoch component to work around DVDriver hang
									problem. Check for sync I/O problem when called at non-task
									time.
		<18>	 6/17/99	GDW		Added more device control calls.
		<17>	 6/16/99	RS		Do parameter checking on all public IDH functions. Turn on
									exclusive access checking. Fix bug with I/O direction atom size.
		<16>	 6/16/99	GDW		Add calls to device control component.
		<15>	 6/15/99	RS		Updating device list everytime a device is added or removed.
									Locking down atom container when we are copying data from atom
									to pointer.
		<14>	 6/15/99	RS		Added synchronous I/O and passing a 'nil' buffer into IDHWrite.
		<13>	 6/15/99	RS		Changed IODirection on DV configs from input to InputAndOutput.
		<12>	 6/15/99	RS		Merged DVFamilyLib into Isoch component. Added seed for device
									list validity check from client. Create component globals in
									register and free in unregister. Check seed when client does a
									SetConfig.
	  <OX11>	 6/11/99	SW		MasterInterfaces integration
		<10>	 6/10/99	RS		Added two new IDH functions ReleaseBuffer and CancelIO. Added
									notification version of Reads and Writes. MAJOR CHANGES.
		 <9>	  6/8/99	RS		Fixed bug storing IDHDeviceStatus in atom list.
		 <8>	  6/7/99	RS		Keep track of open for reads/writes per device.
		 <7>	  6/7/99	RS		Saving open permissions in component instance. Replaced Fail
									macro with new macro that displays function return code (better
									for debug). Disable device on close based on permissions flags.
									Returning bufferlist on read/write completion callback. Fixed
									bug in IDHWrite where we weren't doing a DVCWriteFrame.
	   	 <6>	  6/4/99	SW		Adjust for slight changes in IDH.i
		 <5>	  6/1/99	RS		Added private functions to find device atom given any of its
									siblings and a function to get device status given a device ID.
									Added device standard and firewire node ID to status struct.
									Save open permissions in device status.
		 <4>	 5/24/99	RS		Changed param type in SetDeviceConfig. Allow user to get device
									status on any device (not just configured device). Changed
									IDHIsochReadData and IDHIsochWriteData to IDHReadData and
									IDHWrite.
		 <3>	 5/24/99	RS		We are now returning a copy of device descrip atom container.
		 <2>	 5/20/99	RS		Added queueing of isoch reads and write. Changed error return
									code names.
