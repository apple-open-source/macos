.SH "NAME"
\fBsudo.conf\fR
\- configuration for sudo front-end
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
\fBsudo.conf\fR
file is used to configure the
\fBsudo\fR
front-end.
It is used to configure sudo plugins, plugin-agnostic path names,
debug flags, and other settings.
.PP
The
\fBsudo.conf\fR
file supports the following directives, described in detail below.
.TP 8n
Plugin
an approval, audit, I/O logging, or security policy plugin
.TP 8n
Path
a plugin-agnostic path
.TP 8n
Set
a front-end setting, such as
\fIdisable_coredump\fR
or
\fIgroup_source\fR
.TP 8n
Debug
debug flags to aid in debugging
\fBsudo\fR,
\fBsudoreplay\fR,
\fBvisudo\fR,
and the
\fBsudoers\fR
plugin.
.PP
The pound sign
(\(oq#\(cq)
is used to indicate a comment.
Both the comment character and any text after it, up to the end of
the line, are ignored.
.PP
Long lines can be continued with a backslash
(\(oq\e\(cq)
as the last character on the line.
Leading white space is removed from the beginning of lines
even when a continuation character is used.
.PP
Non-comment lines that don't begin with
\fIPlugin\fR,
\fIPath\fR,
\fIDebug\fR,
or
\fISet\fR
are silently ignored.
.PP
The
\fBsudo.conf\fR
file is always parsed in the
\(oqC\(cq
locale.
.SS "Plugin configuration"
\fBsudo\fR
supports a plugin architecture for security policies and input/output
logging.
Third parties can develop and distribute their own policy and I/O
logging plugins to work seamlessly with the
\fBsudo\fR
front-end.
Plugins are dynamically loaded based on the contents of
\fBsudo.conf\fR.
.PP
A
\fIPlugin\fR
line consists of the
\fIPlugin\fR
keyword, followed by the
\fIsymbol_name\fR
and the
\fIpath\fR
to the dynamic shared object that contains the plugin.
The
\fIsymbol_name\fR
is the name of the
\fIstruct approval_plugin\fR,
\fIstruct audit_plugin\fR,
\fIstruct io_plugin\fR,
or
\fIstruct policy_plugin\fR
defined by the plugin.
If a plugin implements multiple plugin types, there must be a
\fIPlugin\fR
line for each unique symbol name.
The
\fIpath\fR
may be fully qualified or relative.
If not fully qualified, it is relative to the directory
specified by the
\fIplugin_dir\fR
\fIPath\fR
setting, which defaults to
\fI/usr/local/libexec/sudo\fR.
In other words:
.nf
.sp
.RS 4n
Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so
.RE
.fi
.PP
is equivalent to:
.nf
.sp
.RS 4n
Plugin sudoers_policy /usr/local/libexec/sudo/sudoers.so
.RE
.fi
.PP
If the plugin was compiled statically into the
\fBsudo\fR
binary instead of being installed as a dynamic shared object, the
\fIpath\fR
should be specified without a leading directory,
as it does not actually exist in the file system.
For example:
.nf
.sp
.RS 4n
Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so
.RE
.fi
.PP
Starting with
\fBsudo\fR
1.8.5, any additional parameters after the
\fIpath\fR
are passed as arguments to the plugin's
\fIopen\fR
function.
For example, to override the compile-time default sudoers file mode:
.nf
.sp
.RS 4n
Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so sudoers_mode=0440
.RE
.fi
.PP
See the
sudoers(5)
manual for a list of supported arguments.
.PP
The same dynamic shared object may contain multiple plugins,
each with a different symbol name.
The file must be owned by user-ID 0 and only writable by its owner.
Because of ambiguities that arise from composite policies, only a single
policy plugin may be specified.
This limitation does not apply to I/O plugins.
.PP
If no
\fBsudo.conf\fR
file is present, or if it contains no
\fIPlugin\fR
lines, the
\fBsudoers\fR
plugin will be used as the default security policy, for I/O logging
(if enabled by the policy), and for auditing.
This is equivalent to the following:
.nf
.sp
.RS 4n
Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so
Plugin sudoers_io sudoers.so
Plugin sudoers_audit sudoers.so
.RE
.fi
.PP
Starting with
\fBsudo\fR
version 1.9.1, some of the logging functionality of the
\fBsudoers\fR
plugin has been moved from the policy plugin to an audit plugin.
To maintain compatibility with
\fBsudo.conf\fR
files from older
\fBsudo\fR
versions, if
\fBsudoers\fR
is configured as the security policy, it will be used as an audit
plugin as well.
This guarantees that the logging behavior will be consistnet with that of
\fBsudo\fR
versions 1.9.0 and below.
.PP
For more information on the
\fBsudo\fR
plugin architecture, see the
sudo_plugin(5)
manual.
.SS "Path settings"
A
\fIPath\fR
line consists of the
\fIPath\fR
keyword, followed by the name of the path to set and its value.
For example:
.nf
.sp
.RS 4n
Path intercept /usr/local/libexec/sudo/sudo_intercept.so
Path noexec disabled
Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass
.RE
.fi
.PP
If no path name is specified, features relying on the specified
setting will be disabled.
Disabling
\fIPath\fR
settings is only supported in
\fBsudo\fR
version 1.8.16 and higher.
.PP
The following plugin-agnostic paths may be set in the
\fI/privat
e/etc/sudo.conf\fR
file:
.TP 6n
askpass
The fully qualified path to a helper program used to read the user's
password when no terminal is available.
This may be the case when
\fBsudo\fR
is executed from a graphical (as opposed to text-based) application.
The program specified by
\fIaskpass\fR
should display the argument passed to it as the prompt and write
the user's password to the standard output.
The value of
\fIaskpass\fR
may be overridden by the
\fRSUDO_ASKPASS\fR
environment variable.
.TP 6n
devsearch
An ordered, colon-separated search path of directories to look in for
device nodes.
This is used when mapping the process's tty device number to a device name
on systems that do not provide such a mechanism.
Sudo will
\fInot\fR
recurse into sub-directories.
If terminal devices may be located in a sub-directory of
\fI/dev\fR,
that path must be explicitly listed in
\fIdevsearch\fR.
The default value is
\fI/dev/pts:/dev/vt:/dev/term:/dev/zcons:/dev/pty:/dev\fR
.sp
This option is ignored on systems that support either the
\fBdevname\fR()
or
\fB_ttyname_dev\fR()
functions, for example
BSD,
macOS and Solaris.
.TP 6n
intercept
The fully-qualified path to a shared library containing a wrappers for the
execve(2),
execl(3),
execle(3),
execlp(3),
execv(3),
execvp(3),
execvpe(3),
and
system(3)
library functions that intercepts attempts to run further commands and
performs a policy check before allowing them to be executed.
This is used to implement the
\fIintercept\fR
functionality on systems that support
\fRLD_PRELOAD\fR
or its equivalent.
The default value is
\fI/usr/local/libexec/sudo/sudo_intercept.so\fR.
.TP 6n
noexec
The fully-qualified path to a shared library containing wrappers
for the
execve(2),
execl(3),
execle(3),
execlp(3),
exect(3),
execv(3),
execveat(3),
execvP(3),
execvp(3),
execvpe(3),
fexecve(3),
popen(3),
posix_spawn(3),
posix_spawnp(3),
system(3),
and
wordexp(3)
library functions that prevent the execution of further commands.
This is used to implement the
\fInoexec\fR
functionality on systems that support
\fRLD_PRELOAD\fR
or its equivalent.
The default value is
\fIdisabled\fR.
.TP 6n
plugin_dir
The default directory to use when searching for plugins
that are specified without a fully qualified path name.
The default value is
\fI/usr/local/libexec/sudo\fR.
.TP 6n
sesh
The fully-qualified path to the
\fBsesh\fR
binary.
This setting is only used when
\fBsudo\fR
is built with SELinux support.
The default value is
\fI/usr/local/libexec/sudo/sesh\fR.
.\}
.SS "Other settings"
The
\fBsudo.conf\fR
file also supports the following front-end settings:
.TP 6n
disable_coredump
Core dumps of
\fBsudo\fR
itself are disabled by default to prevent the disclosure of potentially
sensitive information.
To aid in debugging
\fBsudo\fR
crashes, you may wish to re-enable core dumps by setting
\(lqdisable_coredump\(rq
to false in
\fBsudo.conf\fR
as follows:
.nf
.sp
.RS 10n
Set disable_coredump false
.RE
.fi
.RS 6n
.sp
All modern operating systems place restrictions on core dumps
from set-user-ID processes like
\fBsudo\fR
so this option can be enabled without compromising security.
To actually get a
\fBsudo\fR
core file you will likely need to enable core dumps for set-user-ID processes.
On
BSD
and Linux systems this is accomplished in the
sysctl(8)
command.
On Solaris, the
coreadm(1m)
command is used to configure core dump behavior.
.sp
This setting is only available in
\fBsudo\fR
version 1.8.4 and higher.
.RE
.TP 6n
group_source
\fBsudo\fR
passes the invoking user's group list to the policy and I/O plugins.
On most systems, there is an upper limit to the number of groups that
a user may belong to simultaneously (typically 16 for compatibility
with NFS).
On systems with the
getconf(1)
utility, running:
.RS 12n
getconf NGROUPS_MAX
.RE
.RS 6n
will return the maximum number of groups.
.sp
However, it is still possible to be a member of a larger number of
groups--they simply won't be included in the group list returned
by the kernel for the user.
Starting with
\fBsudo\fR
version 1.8.7, if the user's kernel group list has the maximum number
of entries,
\fBsudo\fR
will consult the group database directly to determine the group list.
This makes it possible for the security policy to perform matching by group
name even when the user is a member of more than the maximum number of groups.
.sp
The
\fIgroup_source\fR
setting allows the administrator to change this default behavior.
Supported values for
\fIgroup_source\fR
are:
.TP 6n
static
Use the static group list that the kernel returns.
Retrieving the group list this way is very fast but it is subject
to an upper limit as described above.
It is
\(lqstatic\(rq
in that it does not reflect changes to the group database made
after the user logs in.
This was the default behavior prior to
\fBsudo\fR
1.8.7.
.TP 6n
dynamic
Always query the group database directly.
It is
\(lqdynamic\(rq
in that changes made to the group database after the user logs in
will be reflected in the group list.
On some systems, querying the group database for all of a user's
groups can be time consuming when querying a network-based group
database.
Most operating systems provide an efficient method of performing
such queries.
Currently,
\fBsudo\fR
supports efficient group queries on AIX,
BSD,
HP-UX, Linux, macOS, and Solaris.
This is the default behavior on macOS in
\fBsudo\fR
1.9.6 and higher.
.TP 6n
adaptive
Only query the group database if the static group list returned
by the kernel has the maximum number of entries.
This is the default behavior on systems other than macOS in
\fBsudo\fR
1.8.7 and higher.
.PP
For example, to cause
\fBsudo\fR
to only use the kernel's static list of groups for the user:
.nf
.sp
.RS 10n
Set group_source static
.RE
.fi
.sp
This setting is only available in
\fBsudo\fR
version 1.8.7 and higher.
.RE
.TP 6n
max_groups
The maximum number of user groups to retrieve from the group database.
Values less than one or larger than 1024 will be ignored.
This setting is only used when querying the group database directly.
It is intended to be used on systems where it is not possible to detect
when the array to be populated with group entries is not sufficiently large.
By default,
\fBsudo\fR
will allocate four times the system's maximum number of groups (see above)
and retry with double that number if the group database query fails.
.sp
This setting is only available in
\fBsudo\fR
version 1.8.7 and higher.
It should not be required in
\fBsudo\fR
versions 1.8.24 and higher and may be removed in a later release.
.TP 6n
probe_interfaces
By default,
\fBsudo\fR
will probe the system's network interfaces and pass the IP address
of each enabled interface to the policy plugin.
This makes it possible for the plugin to match rules based on the IP address
without having to query DNS.
On Linux systems with a large number of virtual interfaces, this may
take a non-negligible amount of time.
If IP-based matching is not required, network interface probing
can be disabled as follows:
.nf
.sp
.RS 10n
Set probe_interfaces false
.RE
.fi
.RS 6n
.sp
This setting is only available in
\fBsudo\fR
version 1.8.10 and higher.
.RE
.SS "Debug settings"
\fBsudo\fR
versions 1.8.4 and higher support a flexible debugging framework
that can log what
\fBsudo\fR
is doing internally if there is a problem.
.PP
A
\fIDebug\fR
line consists of the
\fIDebug\fR
keyword, followed by the name of the program, plugin, or shared object
to debug, the debug file name, and a comma-separated list of debug flags.
The debug flag syntax used by
\fBsudo\fR,
the
\fBsudoers\fR
plugin along with its associated programs and shared objects is
\fIsubsystem\fR@\fIpriority\fR
but a third-party plugin is free to use a different format so long
as it does not include a comma
(\(oq\&,\(cq).
.PP
Examples:
.nf
.sp
.RS 4n
Debug sudo /var/log/sudo_debug all@warn,plugin@info
.RE
.fi
.PP
would log all debugging statements at the
\fIwarn\fR
level and higher in addition to those at the
\fIinfo\fR
level for the plugin subsystem.
.nf
.sp
.RS 4n
Debug sudo_intercept.so /var/log/intercept_debug all@debug
.RE
.fi
.PP
would log all debugging statements, regardless of level, for the
\fIsudo_intercept.so\fR
shared library that implements
\fBsudo\fR's
intercept functionality on some systems.
.PP
As of
\fBsudo\fR
1.8.12, multiple
\fIDebug\fR
entries may be specified per program.
Older versions of
\fBsudo\fR
only support a single
\fIDebug\fR
entry per program.
Plugin-specific
\fIDebug\fR
entries are also supported starting with
\fBsudo\fR
1.8.12 and are matched by either the base name of the plugin that was loaded
(for example
\fIsudoers.so\fR)
or by the plugin's fully-qualified path name.
Previously, the
\fBsudoers\fR
plugin shared the same
\fIDebug\fR
entry as the
\fBsudo\fR
front-end and could not be configured separately.
.PP
The following priorities are supported, in order of decreasing severity:
\fIcrit\fR, \fIerr\fR, \fIwarn\fR, \fInotice\fR, \fIdiag\fR, \fIinfo\fR, \fItrace\fR,
and
\fIdebug\fR.
Each priority, when specified, also includes all priorities higher
than it.
For example, a priority of
\fInotice\fR
would include debug messages logged at
\fInotice\fR
and higher.
.PP
The priorities
\fItrace\fR
and
\fIdebug\fR
also include function call tracing which logs when a function is
entered and when it returns.
For example, the following trace is for the
\fBget_user_groups\fR()
function located in src/sudo.c:
.nf
.sp
.RS 4n
sudo[123] -> get_user_groups @ src/sudo.c:385
sudo[123] <- get_user_groups @ src/sudo.c:429 := groups=10,0,5
.RE
.fi
.PP
When the function is entered, indicated by a right arrow
\(oq->\(cq,
the program, process ID, function, source file, and line number
are logged.
When the function returns, indicated by a left arrow
\(oq<-\(cq,
the same information is logged along with the return value.
In this case, the return value is a string.
.PP
The following subsystems are used by the
\fBsudo\fR
front-end:
.TP 12n
\fIall\fR
matches every subsystem
.TP 12n
\fIargs\fR
command line argument processing
.TP 12n
\fIconv\fR
user conversation
.TP 12n
\fIedit\fR
sudoedit
.TP 12n
\fIevent\fR
event subsystem
.TP 12n
\fIexec\fR
command execution
.TP 12n
\fImain\fR
\fBsudo\fR
main function
.TP 12n
\fInetif\fR
network interface handling
.TP 12n
\fIpcomm\fR
communication with the plugin
.TP 12n
\fIplugin\fR
plugin configuration
.TP 12n
\fIpty\fR

.TP 12n
\fIselinux\fR

.TP 12n
\fIutil\fR
