     @class IOEventSource
     @abstract Abstract class for all work-loop event sources.
     @namespace I/O Kit
     @updated 2007-03-07
     @throws sandwiches
     @discussion The IOEventSource declares the abstract super class that all
event sources must inherit from if an IOWorkLoop is to receive events
from them.

An event source can represent any event that should cause the work-loop of a
device to wake up and perform work.  Two examples of event sources are the
IOInterruptEventSource which delivers interrupt notifications and IOCommandGate
which delivers command requests.

A kernel module can always use the work-loop model for serialising access to
anything at all.  The IOEventSource is used for communicating events to the
work-loop, and the chain of event sources should be used to walk the possible
event sources and demultipex them.  Note a particular instance of an event
source may only be a member of 1 linked list chain.  If you need to move it
between chains than make sure it is removed from the original chain before
attempting to move it.

The IOEventSource makes no attempt to maintain the consitency of it's internal
data across multi-threading.  It is assumed that the user of these basic tools
will protect the data that these objects represent in some sort of device wide
instance lock.  For example the IOWorkLoop maintains the event chain by handing
off change request to its own thread and thus single threading access to its
state.

All subclasses of the IOEventSource are expected to implement the
checkForWork()
member function.

checkForWork() is the key method in this class.  It is called by some work-loop
when convienient and is expected to evaluate it's internal state and determine
if an event has occured since the last call.  In the case of an event having
occurred then the instance defined target(owner)/action will be called.  The
action is stored as an ordinary C function pointer but the first parameter is
always the owner.  This means that a C++ member function can be used as an
action function though this depends on the ABI.

Although the eventChainNext variable contains a reference to the next event
source in the chain this reference is not retained.  The list 'owner' i.e. the
client that creates the event, not the work-loop, is expected to retain the
source.

    NAME: IOEventSource
    APIUID: 
    ABSTRACT: "<p>Abstract class for all work-loop event sources.
"
    DISCUSSION: "<p>The IOEventSource declares the abstract super class that all
event sources must inherit from if an IOWorkLoop is to receive events
from them.
</p>
<p>An event source can represent any event that should cause the work-loop of a
device to wake up and perform work.  Two examples of event sources are the
IOInterruptEventSource which delivers interrupt notifications and IOCommandGate
which delivers command requests.
</p>
<p>A kernel module can always use the work-loop model for serialising access to
anything at all.  The IOEventSource is used for communicating events to the
work-loop, and the chain of event sources should be used to walk the possible
event sources and demultipex them.  Note a particular instance of an event
source may only be a member of 1 linked list chain.  If you need to move it
between chains than make sure it is removed from the original chain before
attempting to move it.
</p>
<p>The IOEventSource makes no attempt to maintain the consitency of it's internal
data across multi-threading.  It is assumed that the user of these basic tools
will protect the data that these objects represent in some sort of device wide
instance lock.  For example the IOWorkLoop maintains the event chain by handing
off change request to its own thread and thus single threading access to its
state.
</p>
<p>All subclasses of the IOEventSource are expected to implement the
checkForWork()
member function.
</p>
<p>checkForWork() is the key method in this class.  It is called by some work-loop
when convienient and is expected to evaluate it's internal state and determine
if an event has occured since the last call.  In the case of an event having
occurred then the instance defined target(owner)/action will be called.  The
action is stored as an ordinary C function pointer but the first parameter is
always the owner.  This means that a C++ member function can be used as an
action function though this depends on the ABI.
</p>
<p>Although the eventChainNext variable contains a reference to the next event
source in the chain this reference is not retained.  The list 'owner' i.e. the
client that creates the event, not the work-loop, is expected to retain the
source.

    ABSTRACT: "<p>Abstract class for all work-loop event sources.
"
    DISCUSSION: "<p>The IOEventSource declares the abstract super class that all
event sources must inherit from if an IOWorkLoop is to receive events
from them.
</p>
<p>An event source can represent any event that should cause the work-loop of a
device to wake up and perform work.  Two examples of event sources are the
IOInterruptEventSource which delivers interrupt notifications and IOCommandGate
which delivers command requests.
</p>
<p>A kernel module can always use the work-loop model for serialising access to
anything at all.  The IOEventSource is used for communicating events to the
work-loop, and the chain of event sources should be used to walk the possible
event sources and demultipex them.  Note a particular instance of an event
source may only be a member of 1 linked list chain.  If you need to move it
between chains than make sure it is removed from the original chain before
attempting to move it.
</p>
<p>The IOEventSource makes no attempt to maintain the consitency of it's internal
data across multi-threading.  It is assumed that the user of these basic tools
will protect the data that these objects represent in some sort of device wide
instance lock.  For example the IOWorkLoop maintains the event chain by handing
off change request to its own thread and thus single threading access to its
state.
</p>
<p>All subclasses of the IOEventSource are expected to implement the
checkForWork()
member function.
</p>
<p>checkForWork() is the key method in this class.  It is called by some work-loop
when convienient and is expected to evaluate it's internal state and determine
if an event has occured since the last call.  In the case of an event having
occurred then the instance defined target(owner)/action will be called.  The
action is stored as an ordinary C function pointer but the first parameter is
always the owner.  This means that a C++ member function can be used as an
action function though this depends on the ABI.
</p>
<p>Although the eventChainNext variable contains a reference to the next event
source in the chain this reference is not retained.  The list 'owner' i.e. the
client that creates the event, not the work-loop, is expected to retain the
source.

    ABSTRACT: "<p>Abstract class for all work-loop event sources.
"
    DISCUSSION: "<p>The IOEventSource declares the abstract super class that all
event sources must inherit from if an IOWorkLoop is to receive events
from them.
</p>
<p>An event source can represent any event that should cause the work-loop of a
device to wake up and perform work.  Two examples of event sources are the
IOInterruptEventSource which delivers interrupt notifications and IOCommandGate
which delivers command requests.
</p>
<p>A kernel module can always use the work-loop model for serialising access to
anything at all.  The IOEventSource is used for communicating events to the
work-loop, and the chain of event sources should be used to walk the possible
event sources and demultipex them.  Note a particular instance of an event
source may only be a member of 1 linked list chain.  If you need to move it
between chains than make sure it is removed from the original chain before
attempting to move it.
</p>
<p>The IOEventSource makes no attempt to maintain the consitency of it's internal
data across multi-threading.  It is assumed that the user of these basic tools
will protect the data that these objects represent in some sort of device wide
instance lock.  For example the IOWorkLoop maintains the event chain by handing
off change request to its own thread and thus single threading access to its
state.
</p>
<p>All subclasses of the IOEventSource are expected to implement the
checkForWork()
member function.
</p>
<p>checkForWork() is the key method in this class.  It is called by some work-loop
when convienient and is expected to evaluate it's internal state and determine
if an event has occured since the last call.  In the case of an event having
occurred then the instance defined target(owner)/action will be called.  The
action is stored as an ordinary C function pointer but the first parameter is
always the owner.  This means that a C++ member function can be used as an
action function though this depends on the ABI.
</p>
<p>Although the eventChainNext variable contains a reference to the next event
source in the chain this reference is not retained.  The list 'owner' i.e. the
client that creates the event, not the work-loop, is expected to retain the
source.

    ABSTRACT: "<p>Abstract class for all work-loop event sources.
"
    DISCUSSION: "<p>The IOEventSource declares the abstract super class that all
event sources must inherit from if an IOWorkLoop is to receive events
from them.
</p>
<p>An event source can represent any event that should cause the work-loop of a
device to wake up and perform work.  Two examples of event sources are the
IOInterruptEventSource which delivers interrupt notifications and IOCommandGate
which delivers command requests.
</p>
<p>A kernel module can always use the work-loop model for serialising access to
anything at all.  The IOEventSource is used for communicating events to the
work-loop, and the chain of event sources should be used to walk the possible
event sources and demultipex them.  Note a particular instance of an event
source may only be a member of 1 linked list chain.  If you need to move it
between chains than make sure it is removed from the original chain before
attempting to move it.
</p>
<p>The IOEventSource makes no attempt to maintain the consitency of it's internal
data across multi-threading.  It is assumed that the user of these basic tools
will protect the data that these objects represent in some sort of device wide
instance lock.  For example the IOWorkLoop maintains the event chain by handing
off change request to its own thread and thus single threading access to its
state.
</p>
<p>All subclasses of the IOEventSource are expected to implement the
checkForWork()
member function.
</p>
<p>checkForWork() is the key method in this class.  It is called by some work-loop
when convienient and is expected to evaluate it's internal state and determine
if an event has occured since the last call.  In the case of an event having
occurred then the instance defined target(owner)/action will be called.  The
action is stored as an ordinary C function pointer but the first parameter is
always the owner.  This means that a C++ member function can be used as an
action function though this depends on the ABI.
</p>
<p>Although the eventChainNext variable contains a reference to the next event
source in the chain this reference is not retained.  The list 'owner' i.e. the
client that creates the event, not the work-loop, is expected to retain the
source.
