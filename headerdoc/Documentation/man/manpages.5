.Nd \&An introduction \&to manual pages
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Manual pages (often shortened \&to "man pages") are \&a means \&of providing documentation \&on the command line.  Most manual pages describe low-level programming interfaces, command-line tools, and file formats.
.Pp
This manual page \&is intended \&to help you learn about manual pages, their purpose, their style, and their overall layout \&so that you can better take advantage \&of the content that they provide.
.Pp
.Sh MANUAL PAGE STYLE
Because manual pages are written \&by software engineers from many different companies and organizations around the world, the format \&of these manual pages varies somewhat from page \&to page, \&as does the style.
.Pp
\&In general, however, manual pages are written \&to \&be \&as concise \&as possible.  While this makes them \&a somewhat difficult place \&to start \&as \&a new programmer, this \&is intentional.  They are not intended \&to replace conceptual documentation such \&as books \&on programming.  They are intended primarily \&to provide \&a quick reference for people who are already somewhat familiar with the subject.
.Pp
Some manual pages provide links \&to outside websites.  You can often find more thorough conceptual documentation, sample code, and other useful information \&at these websites.
.Pp
.Sh MANUAL PAGE SECTIONS
The manual \&is divided into sections.  Each section covers \&a particular subject area.  The major manual page sections are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXXX
.It 1
General User Commands
.It 2
System Calls
.It 3
Library Routines (*)
.It 4
Special Files and Sockets
.It 5
File formats and Conventions
.It 6
Games and Fun Stuff
.It 7
Miscellaneous Documentation
.It 8
System Administration
.It 9
Kernel and Programming Style
.It \&n
Tcl/Tk
.El
.Pp
.Pp
(*) Excludes library routines that merely wrap system calls. Those routines are covered \&in section 2.
.Pp
The majority \&of commonly used commands appear \&in sections 1 and 8 \&of the manual, while most programming information \&is found \&in sections 2 and 3.
.Pp
These subject areas may \&be further subdivided.  For example, manual section 3 was originally intended \&to hold documentation \&in the standard \&C library but has been expanded \&to include functions \&in other \&C language libraries, such \&as section 3ssl (OpenSSL functions).
.Pp
Section 3 has even been expanded \&to include other programming languages.  For example, section 3pm contains documentation for Perl modules).
.Pp
\&It \&is common \&to have multiple manual pages with the same name but different section numbers.  This usually occurs when \&a command shares \&a name with \&a \&C function \&or system call that does something very similar.  \&To avoid any confusion, manual pages are commonly referred \&to \&in the form name(number), \&in which the number \&is the section number.
.Pp
.Sh MANUAL PAGE TOOLS
You can read manual pages \&in \&a number \&of ways.  The most common way \&to read manual pages \&is with the 
.Xr man 1 
tool from the command line.  For example, typing "man man" displays the manual page for the man tool.
.Pp
\&If there are multiple manual pages with the same name but different section numbers (for example, open(1) and open(2)), you can specify \&a section number when requesting the page.  For example, the command "man 2 open" displays the manual page for the "open" system call from section 2 \&of the manual.
.Pp
You can also read manual pages from within Xcode \&by choosing the "Open man page..." option \&in the Help menu, \&or within your choice \&of web browsers \&by going \&to 
<http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/>.
.Pp
\&In addition \&to searching for manual pages \&on the web, the manual page architecture also provides two useful command-line tools for searching the manual pages: whatis and apropos.
.Pp
The 
.Xr whatis 1 
command searches the manual page headings (command and function names) for \&a word.  \&If that word appears \&in its entirety, \&it shows the matching name and abstract. For example, typing "whatis man" returns results for man and man.conf. This \&is mostly \&of interest \&if you want \&to read \&an abstract for \&a particular command.
.Pp
The 
.Xr apropos 1 
command \&is \&a much more user-friendly version \&of whatis.  \&It searches the same database, but searches the manual page abstracts \&as well \&as the titles.  Unlike the whatis command, apropos returns results for partial word matches.
.Pp
NOTE: Both apropos and whatis depend \&on \&a database \&to provide information.  This database \&is updated periodically.  \&On fresh installations, however, \&it may not \&be present.  \&If apropos and whatis are not working correctly, you should run the following command \&as \&an admin user:
.Pp
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
sudo /usr/libexec/makewhatis
.Pp
.Ed
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Ed
This will rebuild the database.  Enter your admin password when prompted.
.Pp
.Sh MANUAL PAGE STRUCTURE
Manual pages \&do not have \&a fixed structure.  However, most manual pages \&do follow certain conventions.
.Pp
Manual pages typically begin with \&a 
.Sy NAME
section, which contains the name \&of \&a command \&or function and \&a short abstract.
.Pp
Next, manual pages typically include \&a 
.Sy SYNOPSIS
section, which describes how \&to use the command \&or function.  For functions, the syntax generally contains the necessary include directives, followed \&by the function declarations themselves.  For commands, the syntax \&is explained \&in 
.Sy MANUAL PAGE SYNTAX.
.Pp
After the 
.Sy SYNOPSIS
section, you will generally find \&a 
.Sy DESCRIPTION
section, followed \&by \&an 
.Sy OPTIONS
section (which explains the flags from the 
.Sy SYNOPSIS
section.
.Pp
You may find sections such \&as 
.Sy ENVIRONMENT
.Sy HISTORY,
.Sy BUGS,
.Sy CONFORMING TO,
.Sy AUTHOR,
and 
.Sy COPYRIGHT.
.Pp
Finally, most manual pages end with \&a section called 
.Sy SEE ALSO,
which includes the names and section numbers \&of related manual pages.
.Pp
.Sh MANUAL PAGE SYNTAX
\&In manual page syntax, anything \&in \&a normal text font \&is required text.  Anything \&in \&a 
.Sy boldface
font \&is \&a flag \&or \&a subcommand.  Anything 
.Em underlined
\&is \&a user-specified argument such \&as \&a filename.
.Pp
Any argument surrounded \&by brackets \&is considered \&to \&be optional.  For example, \&[
.Em filename
\&] would indicate \&an optional filename argument.
.Pp
Flags, arguments, \&or subcommands separated \&by \&a vertical separator (|) are mutually exclusive.  For example, \&if \&-a turns \&on \&an option and \&-b turns off the option, the syntax for this command might \&be 
.Sy \&-a
\&| 
.Sy -b.
.Pp
\&In some cases, you may even see entire groups \&of arguments wrapped with brackets and separated \&by \&a vertical separator. This \&is one way \&of showing that \&a command has more than one valid syntax.  \&In other manual pages, this \&is expressed \&by having multiple lines \&in the synopsis, each \&of which begins with the command name.  The separated format \&is more common (and more readable), but \&is not always possible for commands with particularly complex syntax.
.Pp
Finally, the most important notational convention \&is the use \&of the ellipsis (...).  This indicates that additional arguments may \&be added \&at this point.  Depending \&on the author, you may see this written \&in one \&of two ways:
.Pp
.Em argument
\&[
.Em argument...
\&]
.br
.Em argument...
