<H1><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="gperf_toc.html#TOC22">7  Implementation Details of GNU <CODE>gperf</CODE></A></H1>

<P>
A paper describing the high-level description of the data structures and
algorithms used to implement <CODE>gperf</CODE> will soon be available.  This
paper is useful not only from a maintenance and enhancement perspective,
but also because they demonstrate several clever and useful programming
techniques, e.g., `Iteration Number' boolean arrays, double
hashing, a "safe" and efficient method for reading arbitrarily long
input from a file, and a provably optimal algorithm for simultaneously
determining both the minimum and maximum elements in a list.
