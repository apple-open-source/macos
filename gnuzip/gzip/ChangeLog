2002-09-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS, README, revision.h, configure.in (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE):
	Revision 1.3.5, dated today.

	* util.c (fprint_off): Fix bug in printing values greater than
	10 * 2**32 bytes.  Bug reported by Bryan Andersen.

	* Makefile.am (match.$(OBJEXT)): Use .S as extension for $(ASCPP),
	to keep gcc happy.
	* configure.in: Likewise.
	Upgrade assembly-language checking for Autoconf 2.54, using cache vars.
	(AC_PROG_CPP, AC_OBJEXT): Add.

	* match.c: Accept __i386 and __i386__ as synonyms for i386.

2002-09-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* gzip.texi (Overview): Suggest how to use gunzip on zip files.

	Suggested by <antos@MAST.queensu.ca>.

2002-09-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* zforce.in: Use shell pattern matching instead of 'expr', which
	mishandles names like "+".  Remove old check for 14-byte file
	names on hosts with broken "mv" implementations, as such systems
	aren't in use any more and it's better nowadays to support file
	names longer than 14 bytes.  Rely on "mv"'s error-reporting.
	This fixes a portability bug reported by Ralf Neubauer, along
	with some other bugs.
	
	Remove dangling output symlinks properly.
	Bug reported by Kalle Olavi Niemitalo.
	* gzip.c (lstat): New macro, for platforms lacking lstat.

	* zforce.in: Use "gzip -lv", not "gzip -v".  Patch by Ralf
	Neubauer.

	* configure.in (ASCPP): Don't use test -a, as POSIX says it's
	not portable.
	* znew.in: Likewise.
	* zmore.in: Likewise.  Similarly, don't use test -o, or test -t
	with no operand.

	* gzexe.in (PATH): Set to same as other programs.
	Don't assume "tail +22" works; POSIX removed this.
	Check against compressing "tail".

	* zgrep.in: Exit with status 2 if trouble, for consistency with grep.
	
	* gzip.c (main): Avoid core dump in diagnostic message if
	incorrect suffix is given.

	* Makefile.am (AM_MAKEINFOFLAGS): Add --no-split.
	(gzip_TEXINFOS): New macro.

	* tailor.h (NO_DIR): Define to 1, not the empty string.
	* gzip.c (NO_DIR): Define to 0 if not defined.  All uses changed.
	(usage): Don't put '#if' inside printf, as the C standard says
	that it is not portable if printf is a macro.

	Don't lose output when decompressing truncated input.
	Bug reported by Nadav Har'El.
	* inflate.c (GETBYTE): New macro.
	(NEXTBYTE): Use it.
