/*
 * XXX - is self_check() sufficient for this?  It'll handle the "localhost"
 * case (as 127.0.0.1 will be one of our addresses), and it should
 * handle our primary host name, with or without qualifications.  We
 * need to call it anyway, to handle multi-homing and .local hostnames,
 * and if we can just use self_check(), that avoids a gethostname() system
 * call and some compares.
 *
 * One problem with self_check() is that it can be expensive if you're
 * using it on a lot of names, as it looks up the host name and compares
 * all the IP addresses for that host name with all of the IP addresses
 * for the machine.  If that's done for all the entries in the -fstab
 * map, as would be the case for an "ls -l" done on /Network/Servers or
 * if the Finder's looking at everything in /Network/Servers - as it would
 * in column view when you're looking at anything under /Network/Servers -
 * then, the first time that happens, it does a host name lookup for every
 * server listed there, meaning it could do a DNS lookup for every such
 * host.
 *
 * We use host_is_us() as a "fast path" check; instead of trying to look
 * up the host name, we do a quick comparison against the result of
 * gethostname() (the primary DNS host name) and against the result
 * of SCDynamicStoreCopyLocalHostName() (the local host name) and
 * "localhost", and then check whether it matches the result of a
 * reverse lookup of any of our IP addresses.
 *
 * When we have a loopback file system, so we can use that for entries
 * in -fstab that refer to us, rather than making those entries a symlink
 * to /, we should be able to avoid this hack.
