 *
 *              Except for running during SleepServices time, while a system is on battery power
 *              a ApplePushServiceTask assertion cannot keep the machine in a higher power state.
 *              e.g. An ApplePushServiceTask cannot prevent sleep if the system is on battery.
 *
 *              Awake Behavior on AC power: this assertion has no effect during full wake. 
 *
 *              DarkWake Behavior on AC power: this assertion will force the system not to sleep;
 *                  e.g. the system will stay in DarkWake as long as this assertion is held.
 *
 *              If the platform supports SilentRunning, the assertion shall implement
 *              this behavior:
 *                   - Keeps the system awake during DarkWake.
 *                   - Valid on AC & Battery
 *                   - Only valid in DarkWake
 *                   - Only valid during global SleepServicesTimeout Window (as determined by powerd)

 *

 *
 * @discussion  Since pushes might or might not cause a user interactive wake, OS X needs
 *              to wait until the recipient App can decide whether they do. Thus apsd and 
 *              apps must hold this assertion while they process incoming pushes.

 *                   - Reverts sleeps in progress.

 *              <li> IOPMAssertionDeclareNotificationEvent shall not light the screen if the lid is closed.
 *              <li> IOPMAssertionDeclareNotificationEvent will not modify the user's chosen brightness setting. When the display lights, it will light to the user's previously chosen brightness setting.
 *              <li> IOPMAssertionDeclareNotificationEvent shall not affect the user's HID idleness counters; and it shall not interrupt regular idle display sleep timers.
 *              <li> If Display Sleep == 10 minutes, and the user has been idle for 9 minutes, and NC calls IOPMAssertionDeclareNotificationEvent(secondsToDisplay=5.0) then the display shall still idle sleep at 10 minutes.

 * @param       secondsToDisplay CFTimeInterval number of seconds to keep the display lit.
 * @param       AssertionID Optional return value. Upon success, AssertionID will point
 *              to a valid power assertion. To call IOPMAssertionDeclareNotificationEvent,
