 * @discussion  When active during a SleepServices wake, will keep the system awake, subject to
 *              the sleep services time cap.
 *
 *              Except for running during SleepServices time, while a system is on battery power
 *              a ApplePushServiceTask assertion cannot keep the machine in a higher power state.
 *              e.g. An ApplePushServiceTask cannot prevent sleep if the system is on battery.
 *
 *              Awake Behavior on AC power: this assertion has no effect during full wake. 
 *
 *              DarkWake Behavior on AC power: this assertion will force the system not to sleep;
 *                  e.g. the system will stay in DarkWake as long as this assertion is held.
 *
 *              If the platform supports SilentRunning, the assertion shall implement
 *              this behavior:
 *                   - Keeps the system awake during DarkWake.
 *                   - Valid on AC & Battery
 *                   - Only valid in DarkWake
 *                   - Only valid during global SleepServicesTimeout Window (as determined by powerd)
 *                   - Only valid while SMC is in SilentRunning mode
 *
 *              If the platform doesn't support SilentRunning, the assertion shall

 *                   - Prevents idle sleep
 *                   - Valid on AC & Battery
 *                   - Only valid in FullWake
 *                   - Only valid during global SleepServicesTimeout Window (as determined by powerd)

 *              a user interactive wake or NotificationWake.
 *
 * @discussion  Since pushes might or might not cause a user interactive wake, OS X needs
 *              to wait until the recipient App can decide whether they do. Thus apsd and 
 *              apps must hold this assertion while they process incoming pushes.

 *                   - Reverts sleeps in progress.
 *                   - Valid on AC & Battery

 *                      to completion over avoiding fan noise.
 *

 *

 *                      off in silent running mode. Holding this assertion during darkwake results

 *               On Battery: This assertion is not honoured.
 *
 *              Behavior on Systems that don't support Silent Running:
