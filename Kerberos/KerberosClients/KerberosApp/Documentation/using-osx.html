      <p>Below the Active User box and the Renew Tickets, Destroy Tickets, and 
        Change Password buttons is the <i>ticket list</i>. The ticket list shows 
        all the principals that are currently authenticated in the current Mac 
        OS X user's session.</p>
      <p>Each principal has a set of Kerberos tickets belonging to it. When you 
        log in with Kerberos, you get a <i>ticket-granting ticket</i> which then 
        allows you to get other tickets from other applications (also called services). 
        Then for each application you run that requires Kerberos authentication, 
        you get a <i>service ticket</i>.</p>
      <p>By default, the principals and their tickets appear as a summary line 
        in the ticket list. The summary lines are in bold text. Each summary line has three elements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Kerberos versions supported by the realm the principal is authenticated 
          in. This appears as &quot;(v4/v5)&quot;, &quot;(v4)&quot;, or &quot;(v5)&quot; 
          before the principal. When you log in using Kerberos for Macintosh, 
          it will attempt to get both Kerberos v4 and v5 tickets for your principal. 
          However, not all Kerberos-using sites support both versions (v4 is becoming 
          less common), or different realms at the same site may also support 
          different versions, so you may see only one version listed.</li>
        <li>The username of the authenticated principal.</li>
        <li>The minimum remaining lifetime for the ticket-granting tickets belonging 
          to the principal (displayed as hours:minutes). You receive one ticket-granting 
          ticket for each Kerberos version the realm supports; these may have 
          different expiration times (although Kerberos for Macintosh attempts 
          to make them the same).</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>Instead of a time, you may see either &quot;expired&quot; or &quot;not valid&quot; in the Time
		Remaining column.  &quot;Expired&quot; means that your tickets have no time remaining and
		so are no longer valid; &quot;not valid&quot; means they are no longer valid for some
		other reason, usually because your Mac's IP address has changed since you obtained
		the tickets.  In either case, you need to renew your tickets (although Kerberos for
		Macintosh will also prompt you automatically to renew if you try to use a service
		requiring Kerberos tickets).</p>
      <p>If you want to see details of tickets associated with each principal, 
        click on the triangle at the left of the principal's summary line. The 
        list will expand:</p>
      <p><IMG SRC="Graphics/osx-kerbmgr4.jpg" ALT="Expanded ticket list illustration" WIDTH="470" HEIGHT="422"></p>
      <p>In the expanded list, you will see a list of the tickets (credentials) 
        belonging to that principal. If the principal is authenticated for both 
        versions of Kerberos, the tickets are grouped by version underneath a 
        subheading for each version (see picture above).</p>
      <p>If you always want the ticket list to display expanded entries, you can 
        set the &quot;Always expand new ticket list entries&quot; preference. 
        See the <a href="#prefs">Changing preferences</a> section.</p>
      <p>You can display even more detailed information about each ticket using 
        the Ticket Info window. See the <a href="#ticketinfo">Displaying ticket

      <P>If your tickets have expired, or you want to extend the lifetime of existing 
        tickets, you may want to renew your tickets.
      <P>As of Mac OS X 10.3, Kerberos for Macintosh supports the &quot;renewable&quot; 
        property for tickets. If your site allows tickets to have this property, 
        you can renew tickets up for a set amount of time without re-entering 
        your password, as long as your current tickets are still valid (that is, 
        haven't expired). By default, Kerberos for Macintosh tries to get tickets 
        with the &quot;renewable&quot; property; you can change this in the <a href="#short">Kerberos 
        Login dialog options</a> or in the Kerberos application <a href="#pref">preferences</a>.
      <P>In fact, by default, the Kerberos application will automatically attempt 
        to renew your tickets if you leave it running (you can close the main 
        window for convenience). Once half your ticket's lifetime has expired, 
        if it has the &quot;renewable&quot; property, the Kerberos application 
        will automatically issue a renew request for it. It will keep doing this 
        up until the renewable time limit. You can control this behavior by checking 
        or unchecking the &quot;Auto-renew renewable tickets&quot; checkbox in 
        the Kerberos application <a href="#prefs">preferences</a>.
      <P>You can see if a ticket is renewable, and for how long, by using the 
        ticket information window. See <a href="#ticketinfo">Displaying ticket 
        information</a> below.
      <P>If your tickets are expired, or you choose not to use the auto-renew 
        feature and want to renew your tickets before they expire, or your tickets 
        do not support the &quot;renewable&quot; property, use the <strong>Renew 
        Tickets</strong> command.

            To change the default tickets' lifetime, see <A HREF="#prefs">Changing 
            Preferences</A>. If you are very close to the maximum renewable lifetime, 
            your tickets will only be good for the time remaining until the end 
            of the renewable lifetime, which may be shorter than your requested 
            lifetime.</LI>

      <ol>
        <li>Select a ticket entry in the ticket list of the Kerberos application's 
          ticket list. (Note that you can only get info about individual ticket

          to the main entry to see the individual ticket items.)</li>
        <P>&nbsp; 
        <li>Either double-click on the entry, or from the <strong>Tickets</strong>

        <p>At the top of the ticket info window is the principal who owns the 
          ticket, the service that the ticket was obtained for, and the Kerberos 
          version of the ticket. The rest of the information is divided into several

            another reason.</li>
          <li><strong>Flags</strong> (for v5 tickets only) - The properties, such 
            as forwardable and renewable, of the ticket.</li>
          <li><strong>IP Addresses</strong> - The IP addresses for which the ticket 
            is valid. v5 tickets may be valid for multiple or no addresses, so 
            you may see more than one or none listed, although typically you will 
            only see none or one listed. v4 tickets can have no more and no less 
            than one address, so you will only see one listed.</li>
          <li><strong>Encryption</strong> - For v5 tickets, lists both the session 
            key and service principal key encryption types of the ticket. For 
            v4 tickets, lists the string to key type of the ticket</li>

      <P>A default Kerberos realm is specified by the edu.mit.Kerberos configuration 
        file (as distributed from MIT, this realm is ATHENA.MIT.EDU). When using 
        the Kerberos application to log in, by default the Kerberos username and 
        password entered are checked for authorization in this area of the network. 
        You can add other realms, as described in this section, and change which 
        one Kerberos Login uses by default. (For instructions on how to change 
        the default realm, see <A HREF="#prefs">Changing Preferences</A>.) 
      <P>Other realms listed in the edu.mit.Kerberos configuration file can also 
        be used for logging in, but must first be added to the list of &quot;favorite&quot; 
        realms which are displayed in the Kerberos Login dialog. You can do this 
        one of two ways.
      <P>First, you can type the realm you want directly into the Realm field/popup 
        in the Kerberos Login dialog. This will only work if the realm is already 
        in your Kerberos configuration file, or if your site is set up for auto/DNS 
        resolution of Kerberos realms. If you are unsure if either of these are 
        the case, or you try to add a realm this way and it doesn't work, consult 
        your site administrator.
      <P>Second, you can use the <strong>Edit Favorite Realms</strong> of the 
        Kerberos application that provides the following options for making the 
        other realms in the preferences available for use: 
      <UL>
        <LI>You can add one or multiple realms from the edu.mit.Kerberos preferences 
          file to the Favorite Realms List.</LI>
        <LI>If you want to keep the list of Favorite realms to the minimum that 
          you need, you can remove realms from the Favorite Realms List.</LI>
        <LI>You can type in the name of a realm to be used directly. This should 
          only be used for auto configuration/DNS realms; typing in the name of 
          a realm that is not in the configuration file and does not have a auto/DNS 
          configuration at your site will not work, as simply giving the name 
          of a realm does not provide all the necessary information for that realm 
          to be used by Kerberos for Macintosh. If you do not see a realm you 
          want here and are unsure if there is a auto/DNS configuration for it, 
          consult your site administrator.</LI>
      </UL>
      <P>For information on adding new realm information to the Kerberos preferences 
        file, see the <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/macdev/Development/MITKerberos/Common/Documentation/preferences-osx.html">Kerberos 
        Preferences on Mac OS X Documentation</A>. Kerberos for Macintosh does 
        not provide a GUI way to add this information. Generally you should not 
        have to do this, consult with your site administrator first!

                  in the Kerberos Login dialog box after each time you log in, 
                  or to always use the options specified in the Preferences dialog 
                  each time. NOTE: Changes you make to these options only take 
                  effect the next time you obtain tickets. Any tickets that you 
                  currently have maintain the options and lifetimes that were

                      (only applies if &quot;Use these ticket options&quot; is

                      are valid on another machine to which you are connecting. 
                      (We recommend that you leave this option turned on.) Only

                      IP addresses. This feature is required to use many Kerberos 
                      v5 services behind a NAT. Only applies to Kerberos v5 tickets.

                      tickets are used by some Windows 2000 Kerberos services. 
                      Note that unlike the other options, you cannot enable or 
                      disable this option in the login dialog itself. You can 
                      only modify it here. Only applies to Kerberos v5 tickets.

                      property, so that they can be renewed without re-entering 
                      your password as long as your existing tickets are valid. 
                      Tickets can be renewed in this way for the length of time 
                      specified by the slider (which defaults to 7 days). Your 
                      site may not allow you to get tickets with the renewable 
                      property, or may not allow them to be renewable for as long
