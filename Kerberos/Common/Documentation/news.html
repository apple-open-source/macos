<H3>Kerberos for Macintosh 3.5 now available</H3>
<I>June 29, 2001</I>

<P>Kerberos for Macintosh 3.5 has been released and is available for downloading. This is a major new release of Kerberos for Macintosh for Mac OS 8.x and 9.x.

<P>We have created this new release in order to provide you with a new, final-quality Kerberos for Macintosh release in a timely manner.  We expect KfM 4.0 development to continue for some time, mostly due to the Mac OS X work.  The Classic Mac OS components are currently very stable, so we felt it was a good time to make them available separately.</P>
