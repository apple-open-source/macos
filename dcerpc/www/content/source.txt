## Getting and building the source

The DCE/RPC source code is available from the git.macosforge.org git repository:

    ~ $ git clone git://git.macosforge.org/dcerpc.git dcerpc.git

To build the project on Mac OS X, use the Xcode project. This will
build the DCERPC framework and the dceidl IDL compiler, which is
all that is necessary to start writing DCERPC applications.

    ~/dcerpc.git $ xcodebuild -configuration Debug -target dceidl
    ~/dcerpc.git $ sudo xcodebuild -configuration Debug -target dceidl install
    ~/dcerpc.git $ xcodebuild -configuration Debug -target DCERPC

To build on Linux or other Unix-like systems, use the autotools
build system.

    ~/dcerpc.git $ cd dcerpc
    ~/dcerpc.git $ ./buildconf
    ~/dcerpc.git $ ./configure && make
    ~/dcerpc.git $ sudo make install
