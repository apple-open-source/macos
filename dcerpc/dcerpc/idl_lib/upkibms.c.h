**  Functional Description:
**
**  This module contains code to extract information from an IBM
**  single floating number and to initialize an UNPACKED_REAL structure
**  with those bits.
**
**  See the header files for a description of the UNPACKED_REAL
**  structure.
**
**  A normalized IBM short floating number looks like:
**
**      Sign bit, 7 exp bits (bias 64), 24 fraction bits
**
**      0.0625 <= fraction < 1.0, from 0 to 3 leading zeros
**      to compensate for the hexadecimal exponent.
**
**
**  Implicit parameters:
**
**  	input_value: a pointer to the input parameter.
**
**  	r: an UNPACKED_REAL structure.
**
**  	i: a temporary integer variable.
