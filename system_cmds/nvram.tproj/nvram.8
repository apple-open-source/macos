.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I nvram
command allows manipulation of Open Firmware NVRAM variables.  It
can be used to get or set a variable.  It can also be used to print
all of the variables or set a list of variables from a file.
Changes to NVRAM variables are only saved by clean restart or shutdown.
.LP
In principle,
.IR name
can be any string.  In practice, not all strings will be accepted.
New World machines can create new variables as desired.  Some variables
require administrator privilege to get or set.
.LP
The given
.IR value
must match the data type required for
.IR name .
Binary data can be set using the %xx notation, where xx is the hex
value of the byte.  The type for new variables is always binary
data.
.SH OPTIONS
