.Nm Passwd
changes the user's password.
First, the user is prompted for their current password.
If the current password is correctly typed,
a new password is requested.
The new password must be entered twice,
to detect (and avoid accepting) typing errors.
.Pp
The new password should be at least six characters long
and not purely alphabetic.
Its total length should be less than
.Dv _PASSWORD_LEN
(currently 128 characters),
although some infosystems allow longer passwords.
Numbers, upper-case letters, and meta characters
are encouraged.
.Pp
Once the password has been verified,
.Nm passwd
communicates the new password information to
the authenticating host.

.El
