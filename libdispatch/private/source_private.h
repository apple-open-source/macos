/*!
 * @const DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_INTERVAL
 * @discussion A dispatch source that submits the event handler block at a
 * specified time interval, phase-aligned with all other interval sources on
 * the system that have the same interval value.
 *
 * The initial submission of the event handler will occur at some point during
 * the first time interval after the source is created (assuming the source is
 * resumed at that time).
 *
 * By default, the unit for the interval value is milliseconds and the leeway
 * (maximum amount of time any individual handler submission may be deferred to
 * align with other system activity) for the source is fixed at interval/2.
 *
 * If the DISPATCH_INTERVAL_UI_ANIMATION flag is specified, the unit for the
 * interval value is animation frames (1/60th of a second) and the leeway is
 * fixed at one frame.
 *
 * The handle is the interval value in milliseconds or frames.
 * The mask specifies which flags from dispatch_source_timer_flags_t to apply.
 *
 * Starting with macOS 10.14, iOS 12, dispatch_source_set_timer()
 * can be used on such sources, and its arguments are used as follow:
 * - start:
 *   must be DISPATCH_TIME_NOW or DISPATCH_TIME_FOREVER.
 *   DISPATCH_TIME_NOW will enable the timer, and align its phase, and
 *   DISPATCH_TIME_FOREVER will disable the timer as usual.*
 * - interval:
 *   its unit is in milliseconds by default, or frames if the source
 *   was created with the DISPATCH_INTERVAL_UI_ANIMATION flag.
 * - leeway:
 *   per-thousands of the interval (valid values range from 0 to 1000).
 *   If ~0ull is passed, the default leeway for the interval is used instead.

 *
 * @discussion
 * This function is intended to be called from within the event handler block.
 * The result of calling this function outside of the event handler callback is
 * undefined.
 *
 * @param source
 * The result of passing NULL in this parameter is undefined.
 *
 * @param data
 * A pointer to a dispatch_source_extended_data_s in which the data and status
 * will be returned. The data field is populated with the value that would be
 * returned by dispatch_source_get_data(). The value of the status field should
 * be interpreted according to the type of the dispatch source:
 *
 *  DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_PROC:            dispatch_source_proc_exit_flags_t
 *
 * If called from the event handler of a data source type not listed above, the
 * status value is undefined.
 *
 * @param size
 * The size of the specified structure. Should be set to
 * sizeof(dispatch_source_extended_data_s).
 *
 * @result
 * The size of the structure returned in *data, which will never be greater than
 * the value of the size argument. If this is less than the value of the size
 * argument, the remaining space in data will have been populated with zeroes.
