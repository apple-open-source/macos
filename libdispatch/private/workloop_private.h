 * @function dispatch_workloop_set_uses_bound_thread

 * A dispatch workloop created with this property will have a dedicated
 * thread bound to it. Dispatch will internally create the bound thread upon
 * dispatch workloop's activation and manage its lifecycle. Any work that
 * needs to run on the workloop will only be processed by the bound thread.
 *
 * The name of the bound thread will be same as the string label associated
 * with the dispatch workloop. See dispatch_workloop_create_inactive for more details.

 * Dispatch workloop configured with a bound thread does not support suspension.

 * Functions from the dispatch_sync() family on such specially configured
 * dispatch workloop with a bound thread or queues targeting them is not supported.

 * with a bound thread. Such a thread will be created and bound to the workloop
 * upon its activation.
 * Returns -1 otherwise. The dispatch workloop can be still be used like a
 * regular dispatch workloop.
