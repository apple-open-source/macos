  uint32_t. Radar bug #6022298

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-679.2 release):
- Fixed a bug in nm() that was a memory smasher for the code to deal with
  struct sub_umbrella_command and struct sub_framework_command.  Also changed
  the Makefile to use libsyminfo.o.tmp.  Radar bug #5630991.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-679.1 release):
- Fixed a bug in nm() the was using the incorrect value when looping to free
  the process_flags.lib_names[] at the end of the routine.  Radar bug #5630991.

- Changed the Makefile to not use -Wno-long-double and -no-cpp-precomp .
  Radar bug #5563553.

  Radar bug #4029936.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-550 release):
- Ported and cleaned up the code to work with 32-bit and 64-bit Mach-O files.
  Radar bug #3854972.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-549 release):
- Made a change to prevent the code from crashing if handed a 64-bit Mach-O
  file.  The change is in nm() in libsyminfo.c to check to see that the 32-bit
  mach_header is NULL and if so just return.  Radar bug #3854972.

Changes for the 5.16 release (the cctools-520 release):
- Fixed a bug that would cause a crash if libsyminfo was presented with an
  binary of an unknown cputype.  The fix was in nm() in libsyminfo.c to check
  if archInfo is NULL before using archInfo->name.  And if NULL then use a
  sprintf() of the cputype instead. Radar bug #3590209.
- Fixed a memory leak in SymInfoFreeSymbol() that was not free(3)ing the
  symbol->arch.  Radar bug #3554267.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-466 release):
- Fixed the incorrect casts on the comparison of the nlist struct's n_strx field
  where the value being compared to was casted to a long.  The correct fix was
  to cast n_strx to an unsigned long.
- Changed nm() in libsyminfo.c to handle DYNAMIC_LOOKUP_ORDINAL.  Radar bug
  #3210803.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-464 release):
- Made changes to build cleanly with gcc3.3
  - Removed -Wno-precomp from the Makefile
  - Fixed warning for "comparison between signed and unsigned" in libsyminfo.c

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-456 release):
- Picked up the initial implementation.  Radar bug #3145742.
