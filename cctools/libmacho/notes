  This is the 4.2 Openstep side so these bugs don't really matter.
- Added MKDIRS if code to the Makefile to build native on Rhapsody.

  where tar does not.
- Changed the Makefile so profiled objects get built for RC_OS teflon.
- Changed the code ifdef __TEFLON__ to ifndef __SLICK__ (where __TEFLON__ will
  nolonger be defined for Rhapsody builds) so the default builds will be native
  Rhapsody builds.  The changes were to get_end.c, getmachhead.c,
  getsecbyname.c and getsegbyname.c .

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-241 release):
- Added ppc604e to the arch table (Radar 1669413).

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-226 release):
- Added ppc604 to the arch table and to get_arch_from_host().  This is what
  the kernel on the Power Mac 8500 is returning.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-224 release):
- Added a sparc_swap.c and a ppc_swap.c.
  Added them to the Makefile and dylib.ofileList (but not the shlib.ofileList).
- Added i860_swap.c and a m88k_swap.c but did NOT add them to any ofileList.
- Pulled in hppa_swap.c, i386_swap.c, and m68k_swap.c from the libc_gen
  project.  Added them to the Makefile and dylib.ofileList (except hppa_swap.c)
  but not the shlib.ofileList.  Updated these files with the code from 
  libstuff's bytesex.c.
- Updated swap.c from libstuff's bytesex.c adding the following routines:
    swap_dysymtab_command()
    swap_dylib_command()
    swap_prebound_dylib_command()
    swap_dylinker_command()
    swap_indirect_symbols()
    swap_dylib_reference()
    swap_dylib_module()
    swap_dylib_table_of_contents()
- Updated arch.c by changing m98k to ppc and removed the never supported
  architectures (mips,and vax).  Also copied in the implementation of
  cpusubtype_findbestarch() from libstuff's best_arch.c into 
  NXFindBestFatArch() and likewise for cpusubtype_combine() into
  NXCombineCpuSubtypes().
- Fixed the type of headers in getmachheaders() in getmachhead.c to fix a
  warning.
- Fixed a warning in getsectdatafromlib() in getsecbyname.c.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-223 release):
- Put back changes ifndef'ed __TEFLON__ .

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-221.6 and cctools-222 releases):
- Picked up changes to get_end() in get_end.c to use _NSGetMachExecuteHeader().
- Picked up changes to getmachheaders() in getmachhead.c to use
  _NSGetMachExecuteHeader().
- Picked up changes to getsectbyname() and getsectdatafromlib() in
  getsecbyname.c to use _NSGetMachExecuteHeader().
- Picked up changes to getsegbyname() in getsegbyname.c to use
  _NSGetMachExecuteHeader().

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-221.1 and cctools-222 releases):
- Picked up changed to the Makefile to not build profile objects for teflon.
  This is because the PowerPC compiler core dumps with -pg.
