- cpusubtype_findbestarch() in best_arch.c when passed CPU_SUBTYPE_POWERPC_ALL
  as the cpusubtype and only 7440 and 750 were in the fat file nothing was
  selected.  Is this right?

TODO:
- Deal with LC_PREPAGE and unknown load commands that don't need to be swapped.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-416 release):
- Changed writeout() in writeout.c to not update the LC_ID_DYLIB timestamp if
  the new dont_update_LC_ID_DYLIB_timestamp is TRUE.  Radar bug #2914003.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-414 release):
- Changed the two calls to mach_host_self() in get_arch_from_host.c and
  writeout.c to call mach_port_deallocate() on the port after the calls.  Radar
  bug #2895931.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-412 release):
- Added the no_error_if_missing parameter to symLocForDylib(), dstLocForDylib()
  and LocForDylib() in SymLoc.c .  In LocForDylib() no call to error() is made
  if the installName can't be found.  Radar bug #2882324.
- Added the no_error_if_missing parameter to get_symfile_for_dylib() and
  get_dstfile_for_dylib() in dylib_roots.c which is pass through to
  symLocForDylib() or dstLocForDylib().  Radar bug #2882324.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-411 release):
- Added the header file macosx_deployment_target.c to libstuff so that both the
  ld(1) code and the seg_addr_table(1) code can use the same code. Radar bug
  #2848945.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-404 release):
- Changed crc32() in crc32.c to be a __private_extern__.  Radar bug #2859919.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-400 release):
- Changed the Makefile back to again use the -dependency-file with gcc.
- Added a new throttle parameter to writeout() in writeout.c to allow
  redo_prebinding(3) used with prebinding on demand to throttle back its
  I/O when running in the back ground.  Radar bug #2850642.
- Added code in writeout() in writeout.c to use fcntl() with the F_NOCACHE
  option to not cache the blocks of the output file.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-397 release):
- Changed where "stuff/bool.h" was included in ofile.c
Radar bug #2831923.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-394 release):
- Changed the Makefile to not use the -dependency-file with gcc as well as
  mwccppc.
- Added an include for <string.h> in bytesex.c, ofile_get_word.c to remove the
  warning: implicit declaration of function `memcpy'.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-393 release):
- Added the code needed in check_Mach_O() in ofile.c for the LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB
  variant of the LC_LOAD_DYLIB load command.
- Added the code needed in swap_object_headers() in swap_object_headers.c for
  the LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB variant of the LC_LOAD_DYLIB load command.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-392 release):
- Added the new parameter use_member_syntax to the ofile_process() in ofile.c. 
  Changed the two calls to ofile_process() in dylib_roots.c to pass FALSE for
  use_member_syntax.  Radar bug #2730127.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-389 release):
- Changed writeout() in writeout.c to not set the modification time back by
  5 seconds if the file does not contain an archive.  Radar bug #2788034.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-388 release):
- Changed check_for_install_name() in dylib_roots.c used in seg_addr_table(1)
  so that if the install name starts with @executable_path it is considered ok.
  This will also be a problem for libhotspot/libjvm also, since libhotspot.dylib
  will have a libjvm install_name.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-387 release):
- Changed writeout() in writeout.c to stagger the time stamps of dynamic
  libraires with multiple cpusubtypes.  This avoids problems with prebinding.
  Radar bug #2676444.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-386 release):
- Picked up the crc32.c file from the freeBSD code.
- Added the calculate_input_prebind_cksum parameter to breakout() in breakout.c
  and the new routine cksum_object() to calculate the input's check sum for the
  cases that the redo_prebinding code needs it.
- Added logic to check_Mach_O() in ofile.c for checking the new LC_PREBIND_CKSUM
  load command.
- Added swap_prebind_cksum_command() for the new LC_PREBIND_CKSUM command and
  also updated swap_headers().

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-385 release):
- Moved the routines archive_error(), archive_member_error() and
  Mach_O_error() from ofile.c to ofile_error.c so the redo_prebinding library
  can override them.
- Fixed a bug in breakout.c that called realloc() on *archs which could not
  be NULL the first time.  So set *archs to NULL and *narchs to zero in
  breakout.c.
- Added __private_extern__ to free_archs() in breakout.c.
- Added some checks to checkout() in checkout.c to make sure an MH_DYLIB has
  a LC_ID_DYLIB command and the name.offset is valid.

Changes for the 5.9 release (the cctools-381 release):
- Changed check_Mach_O() in ofile.c and ifdef'ed out the check for unknown
  load commands when OFI is defined.  This is needed so that new load commands
  do not cause NSCreateObjectFileImageFromFile() and the like API's to fail
  when a new load command is seen in the image.  The dynamic linker has also
  been changed to look for the new LC_REQ_DYLD bit and cause dyld to refuse to
  use an image if it contains something that dyld must understand to execute
  properly.

Changes for the 5.9 release (the cctools-370 release):
- Added checks in check_object() checkout.c to check that if there is a hints
  command there is a dysymtab command and if the nhints is non-zero it matches
  the nundefsym value.  Also added check in dyld_order() in checkout.c to
  check the order of the local, external and undefined symbol indexes in
  the dysymtab command.
- Fixed bugs in breakout() in breakout.c where if one of the ofile routines
  set errors to non-zero the breakout code continued on and used
  ofile.arch_flag.name which could be NULL when it called savestr() and caused
  a crash.  This happened when an new load command was added and the old code
  did not know about it, printed a message but later crashed.

Changes for the 5.9 release (the cctools-369 release):
- Added code in check_object() in checkout.c to deal with the two-level hints
  command.  Also added code in dyld_order() in checkout.c to deal with the
  hints table itself.
- Changed copy_new_symbol_info() in writeout.c to take a the old and new hints
  command and writeout the hints.

Changes for the 5.9 release (the cctools-367 release):
- Added code in check_Mach_O() in ofile.c to check an LC_SUB_LIBRARY command.
  Added code in swap_object_headers() in swap_headers.c to call
  swap_sub_library_command().  Added swap_sub_library_command() to bytesex.c .
  Radar bug #2697458.
- Added code in check_Mach_O() in ofile.c to check an LC_TWOLEVEL_HINTS command.
  Added code in swap_object_headers() in swap_headers.c to call
  swap_twolevel_hints_command(). Added swap_twolevel_hints_command() and
  swap_twolevel_hint() to bytesex.c .  Radar bug #2558069.
- Fixed a problem with writeout() in writeout.c not deallocating the memory if
  the write() fails.  This is an issue with the redo_prebinding(3) API so it can
  effect update_prebinding(1).  Radar bug #2691920.

Changes for the 5.9 release (the cctools-364 release):
- Changed cpusubtype_combine() in best_arch.c (as well as NXCombineCpuSubtypes()
  in libmacho) for the ppc to select the highest subtype when there is not
  an exact match and neither is a 601.
- Changed cpusubtype_findbestarch() in best_arch.c (as well as
  NXFindBestFatArch() in libmacho) which had a problem with selecting the ppc
  cpusubtype when an exact match could not be found.  See Radar bug #2678019
  against exec(2).

Changes for the 5.9 release (the cctools-360 release):
- Fixed a bug in writeout() that showed up in strip(1) not correctly excluding
  N_SECT symbols marked with the attribute NO_TOC from the the table of
  contents.  Radar bug #2663483. The old libtool/ranlib Radar bug was #2494286.
- Changed the two calls to malloc() in get_arch_from_host.c to savestr() and
  changed the one call to malloc() in arch.c to savestr().  These were
  changed to allocate() because libdyld/ofi.c needs this and overrides
  savestr() so using allocate() would end up getting multiple definitions of
  _savestr (one from ofi.o and one from libstuff(allocate.o)).
- Changed breakout() in breakout.c to allocate and return its ofile struct for
  the arch it returns.  This will allow the redo_prebinding library API to
  call ofile_unmap() on this.
- Changed guess_short_name() to be __private_extern__ in guess_short_name.c .

Changes for the 5.9 release (the cctools-359 release):
- Fixed two places in ofile.c, three in fatal_arch.c and one in writeout.c that
  was using size_ar_name() and not using the member_name_size and member_name
  fields of the ofile struct for printing error messages.
- Added -Wno-long-double to shutup the compiler for
  <architecture/m88k/fp_regs.h>.

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-357 release):
- Added support for the CPU_SUBTYPE_POWERPC_7450 in arch.c, best_arch.c and
  get_arch_from_host.c. Radar bug #2599869.

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-356 release):
- Changed execute.c and ofile.c to include <libc.h> instead of <bsd/libc.h>

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-345 release):
- Fixed a bug in guess_short_name() that showed up in seg_addr_table(1) that
  caused it to crash as it was doing a strcpy for the suffix when it should
  have been doing a strncpy() (Radar bug #2540744).

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-344 release):
- Fixed a bug in swap_object_headers() which was missing the calls to swap
  the swap_sub_umbrella_command() and swap_sub_client_command().
- Changed cpusubtype_findbestarch() in best_arch.c in the loop looking for the
  lowest_model to save the current lowest_model so it finds the lowest_model.

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-342 release):
- Added support for swapping the LC_SUB_CLIENT load command (Radar bug
  #2533649).

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-341 release):
- Added support for swapping the LC_SUB_UMBRELLA load command (Radar bug
  #2530028).
- Pulled get_arch_from_host() out of arch.c and put it into get_arch_from_host.c
  so kld could avoid referencing host_info and mach_host_self.

Changes for the 5.7 release (the cctools-334 release):
- Changed guess_short_name()'s has_suffix argument to return_suffix to a pointer
  to the suffix so checksyms could check for "_debug".

Changes for the 5.7 release (the cctools-332 release):
- Changed the following routines to take a disablewarnings flag which was added
  to seg_addr_table(1): get_symfile_for_dylib() and get_dstfile_for_dylib() in
  dylib_roots.c and dstLocForDylib(), get_dstfile_for_dylib() and LocForDylib()
  in SymLoc.c (Radar bug #2482327).

Changes for the 5.7 release (the cctools-329 release):
- Changed iinit and ninit fields of the struct dylib_module in
  swap_dylib_module() in bytesex.c to iinit_iterm and ninit_nterm.
  Radar bug #2469527.

Changes for the 5.7 release (the cctools-327 release):
- ifdef'ed __GONZO_BUNSEN_BEAKER__ the code in seg_addr_table.c for its use of
  /Local to use /AppleInternal by default.
- ifdef'ed __GONZO_BUNSEN_BEAKER__ the code in and dylib_table.c for its use of
  /Local to use /MacOSX by default.  And added code ifndef'ed
  __GONZO_BUNSEN_BEAKER__ to use /AppleInternal/...

Changes for the 5.6 release (the cctools-324 release):
- Picked up the mods to SymLoc.c from Doug Wiebe in B&I which no longer does
  a chdir().  This allows the -seg_addr_table option to seg_addr_table not to
  be an absolute path.

Changes for the 5.6 release (the cctools-323 release):
- Found the bug in find_dylib_in_root() in dylib_roots.c which was not doing
  an fts_close() and causing "Too many open files" later.

Changes for the 5.6 release (the cctools-322 release):
- Added ifdef'ed for __SPACE__ and created a macro SYSTEM_LIBRARY in
  dylib_table.c in preparation for the directory changes.  /System/Library
  changing to /MacOSX/System.

Changes for the 5.6 release (the cctools-321 release):
- Moved SymLoc.m to SymLoc.c as it contains only 'C' code and the debugger was
  crashing when it was an Objective-C file.

Changes for the 5.6 release (the cctools-320 release):
- Added support for the new LC_SUB_FRAMEWORK load command to support "Guarding
  against direct linking of non-umbrella frameworks".  The files that swap
  load commands, bytesex.c and swap_headers.c, were update.  As part of this
  work the routine guess_short_name() was broken out of seg_addr_table.c into
  guess_short_name.c so it could be used by the static linker.
  Radar bug 2443212.

Changes for the 5.6 release (the cctools-319 release):
- Added the file seg_addr_table.c with the support routines for segment address
  tables.
- Added the file dylib_table.c which broke out some of the code that was used
  in checksyms(l) in to support routines used by it and the new
  seg_addr_table(l) tool.
- Picked up the file SymLoc.m from Doug Wiebe in B&I which returns the SYMROOT
  for a given release (used by the seg_addr_table(l) tool).  It currently uses
  Foundation which would cause build dependencies problems so this can't be
  used in a submission.  Doug is planning to do a version that does not use
  Foundation.
- Added the file dylib_roots.c which looks for a dynamic library in a given
  root (used by the seg_addr_table(l) tool).

Changes for the 5.5 release (the cctools-307 release):
- Added support for the CPU_SUBTYPE_POWERPC_7400 in arch.c and best_arch.c.
  Radar bug #2397523.

Changes for the 5.4 release (the cctools-300 release):
- Added logic to check_Mach_O() in ofile.c for checking the new LC_ROUTINES
  load command.
- Added swap_routines_command() for the new LC_ROUTINES command and also updated
  swap_headers().

Changes for the 5.3 release (the cctools-292 release):
- Added get_segalign_from_flag() to allow setting the default segment alignment
  to 4K for PowerPC and 8K for everything else.  Used by ld(1) in layout.c in
  layout() to fix Radar bug #2277625.

Changes for the 5.3 release (the cctools-286 release):
- Change the use of the i386 cpp macro to __i386__ and ppc to __ppc__

Changes for the 5.3 release, MacOS X bring up (the cctools-282 release):
- Added the source files arch_usage.c ofile.c print.c set_arch_flag_name.c
  to be shipped so that libtool can be built from the source given to MetroWerks
- Changed swap_ppc_thread_state_t() to not use bit fields for srr1, cr and exr
  to match the ppc_thread_state for Rhapsody/MacOS X.
- Changed host_self() and task_self() to mach_host_self() and mach_task_self()
  for MacOS X.  Also included "stuff/openstep_mach.h" for macros to allow it
  to still build on Openstep.  Also changed ifdef's __SLICK__ to __OPENSTEP__.
- Changed the Makefile to allow for RC_OS=macos for MacOS X builds.
- Changed vm_task_t to mach_port_t in vm_flush_cache.c to build for MacOS X.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-277 release):
- Added default cases for i386 and ppc subtypes to get_arch_from_host() which
  does a sprintf() for the unknown subtypes.  Also added code for unknown
  types to get_arch_name_from_types() insteading of returning "unknown".
  Radar bug #2241690.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-274 release):
- Removed all uses of CPU_SUBTYPE_586SX.  Added the pentium, pentiumpro,
  pentiumIImodel3 and pentiumIImodel5 subtypes. Updated cpusubtype_combine() and
  cpusubtype_findbestarch() deal with the new intel cpusubtypes. Radar bug
  #2231830.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-270 release):
- Fixed a bug in get_toc_byte_sex() which did not have code to deal with the
  extended format #1.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-267 release):
- Added many casts and dummy variables  to deal with MetroWerks compiler
  warnings (the ones with out -Wall). Radar bug #2227678.
- Added support for the 4.4BSD extend format #1 feature where the size of the
  name is in the ar_name field and the name follow the archive header before the
  contents of the member.  A member_name and member_name_size field have been
  added to the ofile struct to support this. Radar bug #1670513.

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-261 release):
- Added the 603e, 603ev, and 750 to the table of arch types.
- Added the case for CPU_SUBTYPE_POWERPC_750 in get_arch_from_host() in arch.c
  (it had support for CPU_SUBTYPE_POWERPC_603e and CPU_SUBTYPE_POWERPC_603ev).
  (Radar 2213821)
- Changed cpusubtype_findbestarch() in best_arch.c for PowerPC subtypes.  If an
  exact match is not found the subtype will be picked from the following order:
	750, 604e, 604, 603ev, 603e, 603, ALL
  Note the 601 is NOT in the list above.  It is only picked via an exact match.
  (Radar 2213821)
- Changed cpusubtype_combine() in best_arch.c for for PowerPC subtypes.
  Combining with the ALL type becomes the other type. Combining anything with
  the 601 becomes 601.  All other non exact matches combine to the ALL type.
  (Radar 2213821)

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-254 release):
- Fixed a bug in swap_dylib_module() where it did not swap the two objc fields.

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-252 release):
- Removed the m98k arch entry from arch.c and reorder the table to put the
  Rhapsody archs first. 

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-247 release):
- Added MKDIRS if code to the Makefile to build native on Rhapsody.
- Changed the Makefile to use gnutar instead of tar because it works on Rhapsody
  where tar does not.
- Changed the Makefile so profiled objects get built for RC_OS teflon.
- Changed the code ifdef __TEFLON__ to ifndef __SLICK__ (where __TEFLON__ will
  nolonger be defined for Rhapsody builds) so the default builds will be native
  Rhapsody builds.  The changes were to execute.c, ofile.c and writeout.c .

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-240 release):
- Moved fatals.c in the Makefile from CFILES2 to CFILES1 so it can be used by
  the GNU assembler source.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-239 release):
- Fixed a bug in get_arch_from_host() for the family cpusubtype not getting
  set correctly for 603, 604 and 604e

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-235 release):
- Added PPC_RELOC_JBSR to reloc_has_pair() in reloc.c .
- Fixed a warning about testing an unsigned value for less than zero in
  writeout.c

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-230 release):
- Added ppc604e to the arch table and to get_arch_from_host().  This is what
  some kernels on some of Power Mac 8500 is returning today.
- Added a cast to writeout.c to get rid of a warning and fix a bug where it
  was testing ran_off < 0 which is now unsigned.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-226 release):
- Added ppc604 to the arch table and to get_arch_from_host().  This is what
  the kernel on the Power Mac 8500 is returning.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-224 release):
- Changed including <bsd/ranlib.h> to <mach-o/ranlib.h> which uses unsigned long
  instead of off_t (64 bits on Teflon).
- Fixed a bug in the __TEFLON__ execute code that was not testing the return
  status for 0.
- Added the routines swap_ppc_float_state_t() and swap_ppc_exception_state_t()
  to swap the other ppc flavors to byteswap.c and swap_headers.c .
- Changed cpusubtype_findbestarch() for PowerPC to deal with the 603 and 604
  types the best I can.
- Changed cpusubtype_combine() for PowerPC to combine any specific cpusubtype
  with the CPU_SUBTYPE_POWERPC_ALL and return the specific cpusubtype.  Made
  a cut at combining the 603 and 604 types.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-222 release):
- Added get_stack_direction_from_flag(), get_stack_addr_from_flag() and
  get_stack_size_from_flag() routines to arch.c.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-221.1 and cctools-222 releases):
- Picked up changed to the Makefile to not build profile objects for teflon.
  This is because the PowerPC compiler core dumps with -pg.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-221 release):
- Picked up the changes for the correct Rhapsody thread state changes into
  ofile.c, bytesex.c and swap_headers.c.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-215 release):
- Updated reloc_is_sectdiff() and reloc_has_pair() in reloc.c for the PowerPC
  relocation types PPC_RELOC_HI16_SECTDIFF, PPC_RELOC_LO16_SECTDIFF and
  PPC_RELOC_HA16_SECTDIFF.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-212 release):
- Added the ppc601 and ppc603 specific arch types.  The specific types at this
  point are treated as mutually exclusive and can't combine with each other and
  only can combine with the ALL type.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-211 release):
- Integrated changes to allow teflon builds (RC_OS=teflon or RC_OS=nextstep) to
  not build shlib in the Makefile.  Also changes in the sources to not
  include <libc.h> for __TEFLON__ builds.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-210 release):
- Changed everything from using m98k to ppc.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-193 release):
- Changed the way what appears to be a malformed fat file for files that start
  with the FAT_MAGIC to treat them as unknown files rather than malformed fat
  files.  This fixes the problem checksyms(l) was having with java applets which
  use the same magic number (bug #63886).

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-185 release):
- Changed checkout.c to deal with ld -r files vs. .o files from the assember
  which differ as the indirect symbol table is between the symbol table and
  string table in the ld -r case. This was to fix redo_prebinding(1) but also
  fixes strip.
- Changed checkout.c to deal with segments marked SG_FVMLIB so not to complain
  about them.  This was to fix redo_prebinding(1).
- Changed ofile.c for i860 thread status on non-m68k machines to not check or
  swap the thread status which the struct has different layout on non-m68k
  machines. This was to fix redo_prebinding(1).

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-168 release):
- Change the version numbers of dynamic library to the form X[.Y[.Z]] to match
  how next does versioning of it's projects.  This effected libtool(1), ld(1),
  otool(1), dyld, libstuff(version_number.c) and man pages for ld and libtool
  bug #55627). The change here is the new file version_number.c.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-166 release):
- Changed the use of the cpp macro DYNAMIC (set by the Makefile) to __DYNAMIC__
  (set by the compiler when -dynamic is in effect).

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-161 release):
- Added in the Makefile passing -DDYNAMIC for things built with -dynamic
  Then ifdef'ed out the const in arch.c for arch_flags[] with DYNAMIC so that
  when this is put in a dynamic shared library it does not have relocation
  entries in a read-only section.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-154 release):
- To fix a bug in stripping .o files compiled dynamic the routine
  copy_new_symbol_info() needed to base it's copy output on if there was an
  dynamic symbol table command in the object not on if it had MH_DYLDLINK in
  the mach header.  So a pointer to the old dynamic symbol table command is now
  passed and if not null the full dynamic symbol table is copied out.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-150 release):
- Fixed some problems in ofile_process() with passing the correct arch_name
  argument to processor() for fat files.
- Changed the profiled objects to be compiled with -dynamic.
- Changed everything to use __private_extern__ .

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-149 release):
- Fixed a bug in ofile_process() in ofile.c for #ifdef OTOOL when an arch was
  specified as for cross bytesex.  The problem was the #ifdef OTOOL does not
  swap the mach header and it was being used in ofile_process() to select the
  arch.  Some ifdef'ed OTOOL was added (bug #50350).

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-148 release):
- Changed how the libstuff directory builds.  It now builds 4 libraries.  One
  for the following uses: static, dynamic, profiled and shlib.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-146 release):
- Fixed a bug in swap_sparc_thread_state_regs() where the reserved field of
  the psw was not included in the swap code (bug #49685).  This was CCC
  approved for 3.3risc and a cctools-142.1 clone with just this fix was
  submitted.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-145 release):
- Changed writeout() to update the time stamp for dylibs.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-143 release):
- Added support to loop through the modules of a dylib in ofile_process() when
  the new prameter dylib_flat == FALSE.  This is use in nm(1) to print the
  symbol tables of a dylib.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-140 release):
- Changed vm_flush_cache() to define __3_3_User_with_hppa__ so it will build
  for 4.0.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-133 release):
- Picked up the sparc changes to byte_sex.c and swap_headers.c that swaps the
  floating-point sparc thread state.
- Picked up the sparc changes to check_Mach_O() in ofile.c for checking and
  swaping the floating-point thread.
- Fixed a problem in strip for cross byte sex striping when the dynamic
  symbol table info is present.  In strip.c the problem was the new symbolic
  tables were not swapped to the target byte sex.  And in writeout.c in libstuff
  the problem was that parts of the headers were used after they were swapped.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-132 release):
- Picked up the sparc changes to reloc.c for the sparc relocs.
- Picked up the sparc changes to byte_sex.c and swap_headers.c that swaps the
  sparc thread state.
- Picked up the sparc changes to check_Mach_O() in ofile.c for checking the
  sparc thread state.
- Fixed a logic bug in cpusubtype_findbestarch() where the loops after the
  cases on the cputype were not checking to make sure the cputype of the fat
  arch struct was right before checking the subtype.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-128 release):
- Fixed a bug in symbol_string_at_end() in checkout.c which was not using the
  object->object_size to test if the LINKEDIT segment covered the end of the
  file.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-125 release):
- Fixed a bug in get_arch_from_host() in arch.c for the hppa where the family
  cpu_subtype was getting set to a specific subtype CPU_SUBTYPE_HPPA_7100 for
  that host.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-124 release):
- Added a temporary error message to check_object() in checkout.c to print the
  error "current limitation, can't process files with LC_DYSYMTAB load command"
  so the strip(1), nmedit(1) and indr(l) for now print a reasonable message
  when such a file is used.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-119 release):
- Picked up first set of changes for sparc target.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-118 release):
- Fixed a bug that crashed strip when doing a strip -S on a library and a member
  had no symbol table command.  The bug was in writeout.c in libstuff at line
  490 where it indirected thought the pointer to the symbol table command
  without checking if it was NULL.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-104 release):
- Changed the name of the first parameter of swap_ident_command() from id to
  id_cmd (in bytesex.c).  The compiler is treating this as a reserved word.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-102 release):
- Integrated in the hppa support.
  Changed the rounding in calc_hppa_HILO() in hppa.h to round to nearest (add
  half then round) from round up.
created libstuff/hppa.c and include/stuff/hppa.h for cctools-102
     Contains the definition of:
	 calc_hppa_HILO()
different libstuff/arch.c (integrated for cctools-102)
     Using cctoolshppa-37.  New stuff for hppa cputype.
different libstuff/best_arch.c (integrated for cctools-102)
     Using cctoolshppa-37.  New stuff for hppa cputype.
different libstuff/bytesex.c (integrated for cctools-102)
     Using cctoolshppa-37.  New stuff for hppa cputype.
different libstuff/ofile.c (integrated for cctools-102)
     Using cctoolshppa-37.  New stuff for hppa cputype.
different libstuff/swap_headers.c (integrated for cctools-102)
     Using cctoolshppa-37.  New stuff for hppa cputype.

Changes for the 3.2 release (the cctools-25 release):
- Added Makefile support for installGNUsrc and fromGNUsrc.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-22 release):
- Changed ofile_map() when one architecture is specified to first look for that
  specific cpusubtype then the family.  This caused gprof(1) to fail to open
  a fat file (or fat shlibs) that had an i486 subtype (bug #31857).
- Added to arch.c (bug #32553):
    { "any",	CPU_TYPE_ANY,	  CPU_SUBTYPE_MULTIPLE },
    { "little",	CPU_TYPE_ANY,	  CPU_SUBTYPE_LITTLE_ENDIAN },
    { "big",	CPU_TYPE_ANY,	  CPU_SUBTYPE_BIG_ENDIAN },

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-15 release):
- Fixed a bug where cpusubtype_findbestarch() would fail to select an i486
  object from a fat file when a starting with a CPU_SUBTYPE_I386_ALL.
  The fix was that cpusubtype_findbestarch() was changed such that
  previously when it failed it would pick something (architecture dependent)
  that will work for the cputype and will successfully combine when
  cpusubtype_combine() is applied to the two cpusubtypes.

    For the i386 architecture the selection is the lowest in order of 
    CPU_SUBTYPE_I386_ALL, CPU_SUBTYPE_486, CPU_SUBTYPE_486SX, CPU_SUBTYPE_586
    and CPU_SUBTYPE_586SX starting with the given cpusubtype.

    For the m68k architecture (where the cpusubtypes do NOT run on anything
    other than that implementation) the selection favors the
    CPU_SUBTYPE_MC68040 over the CPU_SUBTYPE_MC68030_ONLY when starting
    with the cpusubtype of CPU_SUBTYPE_MC680x0_ALL.
  Bug #30765.
- Removed the kludged mach/m98k/thread_status.h with only an entry point and
  added the code to swap the grf thread with the real entry point.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-13 release):
- Added the m98k (PowerPC) architecture.  This includes a kludged
  mach/m98k/thread_status.h with only an entry point.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-10 release):
- Changed the cpusubtypes to use the correct #defines from <mach/machine.h> in
  arch.c, ofile.c and swap_headers.c .  Also added the i486, i486SX, i586, and
  i586SX arch flags and code to back them up.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-8 release):
- Changed the checking in check_archive to only look at the cputype and not at
  both the cputype and cpusubtype (this will change as the correct handling of
  the cpusubtype is implemented).

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-6 release):
- Fixed a bug in get_arch_from_host() where it did not recognize the 486 cpu
  subtype.
- Hacked in a fix for a basic algorthim flaw in ofile_process() in ofile.c as
  it makes a second pass over the mapped ofile it looses the information as
  to which bytesex the objects were because it swaps the memory in place.
  So a call to ofile_unmap() and ofile_map() were placed after the first
  loop.  (this still needs a better fix).

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-5 release):
- Picked up the lono team mods to ofile.c and swap_headers for the change to
  the i386 thread_status.h.
- Picked up the lono team mods to bytesex.c for some new code to swap 16-bit
  address segments.
- Fixed a bug in ofile_next_member() in ofile.c where if the next member was not
  an object file the fields (object_*, mh, load_commands) were not zeroed out.
  This caused libtool(1) to think an archive member was an object file when it
  was not.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-4 release):
- Changed the arch name of ix86 to i386.
- Fixed a bug in get_arch_from_host() in arch.c that set the cpusubtype for the
  family arch_flags wrong.  This needed to be set based on the cputype and
  hard coded for each cputype.  The problem was that the 040 cpusubtype was
  being set for the family arch_flags when the 030 cpusubtype was needed.

Changes for the 3.0 release (the -56 compiler release):
- Added hash_string.c from the mkshlib directory to libstuff.

Changes for the 3.0 release (the -56 compiler release):
- Picked up some fixes for ofile.c where host_byte_sex was not set early enough
  in some of the functions.

Changes for the 3.0 release (the -53 compiler release):
- Added SWAP_FLOAT().

Changes for the 3.0 release (the -49 compiler release):
- Changed {BIG,LITTLE}_ENDIAN to __{BIG,LITTEL}_ENDIAN__ as the cc-49 cc driver
  will define them.
- Changed the Makefile to meet the RC api.

Changes for the 3.0 release (the -44 compiler release):
- Created the libstuff directory.
