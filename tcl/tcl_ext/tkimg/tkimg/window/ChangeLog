	* No longer Panic when an out-of-memory error occurs,
	  when compiled with Tcl/Tk 8.5 or later and running with
	  Tcl/Tk 8.5 and later (Tk bug #2477446)

	* window.c: Removed inclusion of windows.h. This is done through
	  tcl.h and tk.h, doing it here before Tcl/Tk causes a conflict in
	  8.5, which restructured the includes. The change is ok when
	  compiling against 8.[34] as well.
