	* Make all of Tk's stub table entries available to tkImg,
	  no matter what Tk version we are compiling against.

2008-11-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tkImgUtils.c: Fixed syntax error reported by MSVC.

2006-01-27  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* configure.in: TEA 3.5 upgrade, do not use TK_LIBS (anymore).
	* configure:    Regenerated.

	* tkimg.h: use TK_PHOTO_COMPOSITE_SET instead of
	TK_PHOTO_COMPOSITE_OVERLAY to ensure initial alpha is taken
	directly from source image (without compositing). [Bug 987107]

	* Released and tagged Tkimg 1.3 ========================
	*

2002-11-26  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pkgIndex.tcl.in: Added index script to load all format handlers
	  when requiring 'Img', i.e. the old package.

	* tkimgUtils.c (tkimg_FixObjMatchProc):
	* tkimgUtils.c (tkimg_FixChanMatchProc): Changed bit-negation to
	  logical negation. This fixes a bug intriduced by the rewrite to
	  use version info to distinguish between calls from 8.3.2 and
	  8.3. The bug caused the procedure to bail out without rotating
	  the arguments, causing the remainder to end up with the argument
	  in the wrong places, crashing the system when trying to read
	  from the channel or data object.

	  Looking at the signatures I believe that the inherited code is
	  still wrong for calls from 8.3.2.

2002-11-20  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in: The configure variable TK_XINCLUDES has to placed
	  in variable, to avoid problem on platforms placing a shell
	  comment into it. More in the Makefile.

2002-11-19  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tkimg.h (tkimg_PhotoPutBlockTk): Added a convenience macro
	  dealing with the change of the signature of Tk_PhotoPutBlock
	  between 8.3.5 and 8.4 [see TIP 98]. This is a compile time
	  decision. I.e. 'tkimg' and format handlers can be compiled for
	  8.3 and earlier, or 8.4. The result will run only with the core
	  it was compiled for. This might change before the release of Img
	  2.0.

2002-11-18  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* Start of logging.

	* tkimg: The base package for the format handlers to draw upon.
