Announcing XOTcl 1.3.6
**********************

WHAT IS XOTCL?

  XOTcl is an object-oriented extension of Tcl that was derived from
  OTcl. In short, XOTcl tries to provide a highly flexible,
  reflective, component-based, and object-oriented environment. It
  integrates language support for high level concepts which are not
  found in other languages, with reasonable performance. It prevails
  the Tcl programming style and the dynamic/introspective nature of
  the language, rather than introducing other language's styles and
  rigidness (such as C++) into Tcl.


Major changes relative to 1.3.5 are:

     * Improved Functionality
       + new info subcommand: <object> info precedence

       + simplified meta class definitions: every class can be
         changed into a metaclass by adding an instmixin of Class (or
         one of its subclasses) to it. In order to define that every
         class should be a metaclass, one can use now 
            Object instmixin Class 
         instead of the rather complicated solution i posted on
         the xotcl mailing list not long ago.

     * Improved code quality: 
       + fixed possible crashes when 
          - objects are called with class methods (e.g. due to instmixins)
          - when instmixins are defined recursively 
            (e.g. Class instmixin Class)
          - objects are turned into classes by changing the 
            class relationship
       + improved namespace resolution when mixin classes are defined
         in namespaces (::xotcl:: namespace is skipped, since a 
         helper method that calles the primitive setting command 
         is defined there)
       + fixed passing of error code from init methods
         (thanks to Fabrice Pardo for noting it)
       + returning PACKAGE_VERSION after a package require
         (e.g. 'package req XOTcl' returns now 1.3.6)
       + some code refactoring, fixed erroneous documentation of c code
       + improved documentation

 documentation.
