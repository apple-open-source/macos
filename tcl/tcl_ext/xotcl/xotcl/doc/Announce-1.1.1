Announcing XOTcl 1.1.1
**********************

WHAT IS XOTCL?

  XOTcl is an object-oriented extension of Tcl that was derived from
  OTcl. In short, XOTcl tries to provide a highly flexible,
  reflective, component-based, and object-oriented environment. It
  integrates language support for high level concepts which are not
  found in other languages, with reasonable performance. It prevails
  the Tcl programming style and the dynamic/introspective nature of
  the language, rather than introducing other language's styles and
  rigidness (such as C++) into Tcl.


CHANGES relative to 1.1.0 are:

  - Improved portability
     * for Mac OS X (many thanks to Daniel Steffen)
     * freebsd 4.9 (many thanks to Marc Spitzer)

  - configure can run outside of xotcl-tree and
    can install to a different directory. Example:

            % mkdir -p /tmp/xotcl/unix
            % cd /tmp/xotcl/unix
            % ~/xotcl-1.1.1/unix/configure --with-all
            % make
            % make test
            % make install DESTDIR=/tmp

  - several fixes and improvements such as 
     * added option --with-tkinclude for configure 
       (only needed, when built with optional --with-xowish)
     * made gdbm work when compiled with threads enabled
     * fix for initialization of stubtables in gdbm
     * fixes for HTTP support (return format of values in
       HTTP OPTION command made windows explorer hang)
     * easy provision for redirects in HTTP server
