Announcing XOTcl 0.9.4
**********************

WHAT IS XOTCL?

  XOTcl is an object-oriented extension of Tcl that was derived from
  OTcl. In short, XOTcl tries to provide a highly flexible,
  reflective, component-based, and object-oriented environment. It
  integrates language support for high level concepts which are not
  found in other languages, with reasonable performance. It prevails
  the Tcl programming style and the dynamic/introspective nature of
  the language, rather than introducing other language's styles and
  rigidness (such as C++) into Tcl.


CHANGES relative to 0.9.3 are:

  - fixes:
 
     * separate reference counting for XOTcl objects and classes
       to avoid references from tcl_obj's internal representation
       to freed memory

     * fixes for AOL-Server (many thanks to Zoran Vasiljevic for 
       that and for his great help during fixing the problems above)

     * improved portability: horrible macro substitution 
       bug, when USE_ALLOCA or USE_MALLOC was specified; these
       are used for some platforms such as AIX

     * fixing path search for XOTcl library (bug was introduced in 
       0.9.3 in connection with TEA compliance)

     * fixed a bug in copy/move (many thanks for Artur Trzewik
       for reporting this) in connection with constructors 
       (constructors are not called automatically in copy/move
       operations anymore)

     * various small fixes in libraries (e.g. HTTP support, 
       generation of pkgIndex-files, using "my", ...)

  - enhancements:

     * new global command "my": 
       one can use now:

         Class Counter -parameter  {{n 0}}
         Counter instproc ++ {}    { my incr n }
         Counter instproc print {} { puts "actual value: [my n]"}

         Counter c1
         c1 ++
         c1 print

       In earlier versions it was neccessary to use "[self]" 
       instead of "my". This change reduces the number of 
       special characters in XOTcl programs. 
       "[self]" will continue to be supported by XOTcl.
      
     * extended semantics of "new"

        a) Object new ...
        b) Object new -childof  ...
        c) Object new -volatile ...
        d) Object new -volatile -childof ...

       where (a) creates now "global" objects not in the global
       namespace anymore, but in the ::xotcl namespace, (b) can
       be used to create objects as child of other objects
       (e.g. as children of the actual object [self]; the objects
       are deleted, when the specified object is deleted).  (c)
       creates are "global" objects as in (a), but they are
       deleted, when the scope of the current
       tcl-proc/object-proc/instproc is left and (d) is a
       combination of (b) and (c).

  - optimizations:

     * XOTcl is trying to keep Tcl_Objs of type tclCmdNameType
       instead of converting it to XOTclObjectType agressively.

     * A patch for Tcl 8.4a3 is available from the XOTcl web site
       for performance hungry applications to provide special
       byte-code-support for xotcl, that yields for classical
       benchmark programs up to 40%.  This patch is not likely to
       be integrated into the general Tcl core in the new or
       distant future.
