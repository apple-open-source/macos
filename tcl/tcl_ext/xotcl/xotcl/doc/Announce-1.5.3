Announcing XOTcl 1.5.3
*************************

Hi everybody. We are pleased to announce the availability of XOTcl 1.5.3.
Major changes relative to 1.5.2 are:

    * Improved code quality: 

      + provided compatibility with Tcl 8.5 

      + provided compatibility with Tcl 8.4.14 

         (fixed a nasty bug caused by a change in tcl 8.4.14, could
         led to a crash due to freed Tcl_Objs in OpenACS, allthough
         the xotcl regression test passed correctly)

      + reduced calling overhead of methods with nonpositional
         arguments by about 10 percent by avoiding shimmering.

      + fixed handling of "return -code break" from xotcl methods
         (thanks to Artur Trzewik for the bug report)

      + library/comm/Access.xotcl: fixed handling of chunked encoding

 For more details about the changes, please consult the ChangeLog and
 documentation.
