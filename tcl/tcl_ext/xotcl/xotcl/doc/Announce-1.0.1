Announcing XOTcl 1.0.1
**********************

WHAT IS XOTCL?

  XOTcl is an object-oriented extension of Tcl that was derived from
  OTcl. In short, XOTcl tries to provide a highly flexible,
  reflective, component-based, and object-oriented environment. It
  integrates language support for high level concepts which are not
  found in other languages, with reasonable performance. It prevails
  the Tcl programming style and the dynamic/introspective nature of
  the language, rather than introducing other language's styles and
  rigidness (such as C++) into Tcl.


CHANGES relative to 1.0 are:

  - fixes:
 
     * fixed installation bug on windows (when installed on 
       drives different to c:)

     * fixes for aolserver 3.5.*

     * fix for "object info default arg var" in connection
       with filters

     * Serializer handles filter guards now

  - new functionality and improvements:

     * improved recreate semantics, makes it easier to 
       overload recreation logic.

     * new method "noinit" to create objects without
       calling the constructor

  - optimizations:

     * general speedup (10 to 15%) by using client data of
       namespace instead of Tcl_AssocData for interpreter state
      
     * faster and more flexible Serializer
