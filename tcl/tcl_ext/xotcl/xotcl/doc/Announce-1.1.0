Announcing XOTcl 1.1.0
**********************

WHAT IS XOTCL?

  XOTcl is an object-oriented extension of Tcl that was derived from
  OTcl. In short, XOTcl tries to provide a highly flexible,
  reflective, component-based, and object-oriented environment. It
  integrates language support for high level concepts which are not
  found in other languages, with reasonable performance. It prevails
  the Tcl programming style and the dynamic/introspective nature of
  the language, rather than introducing other language's styles and
  rigidness (such as C++) into Tcl.


CHANGES relative to 1.0.2 are:

  - New functionality and improvements:

     * Transitive instmixins (thanks to a suggestion of Neophytos Demetriou):
       The new version supports a tree of mixins (mixins of mixins);
       when a mixin-class X has instmixins Y registered, and X is
       registered as instmixin for a class C, the mixin classes Y are
       applied to C as well.

     * Conditional mixins (thanks to a suggestion of Neophytos Demetriou):
       mixins and instmixins can have now guards similar to filters
       that define when they should be applied

     * New  composition strategy for (filter- and mixin-)guards:
       when a guard is defined more than once for the same interceptor
       the most specific guard is used, the others are overridden.

     * Creation of sub-objects via parameter: 
       XOTcl's parameter method supports now a switch named "-Class"
       which can be used to create and configure sub-objects (see
       tutorial for details)

     * New predefined method: __unknown
       This method is called, whenever XOTcl references a class, 
       which is not defined yet (e.g.: Class C -superclass UNKNOWNCLASS)
       This method is used for Zoran's wonderful ttrace package
       (for aolserver and tcl-Threads)

     * Improved documentation:
        - extended tutorial (Meta-Classes, Tk, ...)
        - beautified tutorial (style files, distinction between 
          literals and placeholders, ...)
        - fixed hundreds of typos

     * some speed improvements


  - fixes:
 
     * New build system:
        - per default no shells are built
        - new configure switches eg. --with-xotclsh, -with-actiweb
          --with-all

     * Fixes for https in connection with some versions of IE

     * Fixed a few issues with purify and mt (many thanks to Zoran!)
 
     * Fixes for proc-scoped variable in connections with mixins

     * Fixed passing of error codes from constructors 

     * various small fixes and code cleanup
       - with newer versions of autoconf
       - various fixes for stubs
       - improved build under windows
       - starkit compliance (many thanks to MichaelL@frogware.com)
