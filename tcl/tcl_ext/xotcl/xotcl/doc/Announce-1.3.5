Announcing XOTcl 1.3.5
**********************

WHAT IS XOTCL?

  XOTcl is an object-oriented extension of Tcl that was derived from
  OTcl. In short, XOTcl tries to provide a highly flexible,
  reflective, component-based, and object-oriented environment. It
  integrates language support for high level concepts which are not
  found in other languages, with reasonable performance. It prevails
  the Tcl programming style and the dynamic/introspective nature of
  the language, rather than introducing other language's styles and
  rigidness (such as C++) into Tcl.


Major changes relative to 1.3.4 are:

  - Qualitative Improvements

     * Improved code quality: 
       + fixed possible segmentation violations in non positional
         argument handling
       + moved the Serializer into a namespace such that
            % package req XOTcl
            % package req xotcl::serializer
            Serialize ....
         works without namespace imports (the Serializer is
         still auto-exported, but this will change in the future)
       + 

     * Improved Functionality
       + Non-positional arguments can be used in the same argument
         list as positional ones (more compliant with OpenACS).
         One can write now
            % Object o
            % o proc foo {-x:boolean -y a b} { ...}
         instead of 
            % ...
            % o proc foo {-x:boolean -y} {a b} { ...}
         All introspection commands will work like before.
         The old syntax (with the additional argument) is deprecated
         and will be dropped in the future.

       + Serializer: support for objects with parent namespaces, which are
         not xotcl objects

       + additional instproc for ::xotcl::Class allinstances
         to return all instances for the actual class 

 For more details about the changes, please consult the ChangeLog and documentation.
