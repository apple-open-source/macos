	ctext.tcl: I fixed bug 2059415 by saving the id from [after idle].
	On widget destruction the ids are catch {after cancel}.

	I also fixed an old bug that occured in the tests, with backspace,
	and the previously highlighted text not being dehighlighted.

	pkgIndex.tcl: I bumped the revision to 3.2

	ctext.man: Updated to revision 3.2

2007-05-11  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* ctext.tcl (ctext::linemapUpdate): make the ctext linemap not
	resize - it maintains the widest size necessary

2006-10-01  Arjen Markus <arjenmarkus@users.sourceforge.net>
	ctext.man updated - -linemap clarified, example reformatted (smaller
	width, for better display and printing), added configure subcommand

	* ctext.man: Fixed formatting bugs in ctext.man

3.1.6 - Wed Apr  6 04:41:13 GMT 2005

	ctext.man was kindly contributed by
	Michael Schlenker.  Thanks Michael :)


3.1.5 - Mon Mar 21 11:23:09 GMT 2005

	ctext_tcl.tcl was contributed to ctext by
	Uwe Koloska.  It provides easy syntax
	highlighting for Tcl scripts.  He has apparently
	added ctext to Nagelfar.
	http://spjuth.pointclark.net/Nagelfar.html

3.1.4 - Thu Aug 12 03:10:06 UTC 2004

	ctext.tcl was changed to fix a bug that
	occured when the geometry management of the
	ctext widget was such that it wouldn't enlarge
	when [$inst configure -linemap 1] was invoked.

	This was fixed using grid and a -minsize.  The
	previous manager was pack.  Grid behaves in an
	appropriate manner for this situation with the
	proper weights and -minsize.

	Thanks to Arjen Markus for testing and bringing
	this up.


3.1.3 - Thu Jan 22 14:51:08 GMT 2004

	I changed the bindtags so that binding to
	the parent frame will cause the child $win.t
	to invoke those bindings.  This means that
	you can create menus that popup on
	ButtonPress-3 without having to use bind.tree
	or a similar mechanism.  Thank Jeff Hobbs
	for pointing this out.
	
	I fixed the destroy event handling, so that
	it will now not cleanup the widget when a
	temporary child of the widget is destroyed.

3.1.2 - Fri May 23 17:33:17 GMT 2003

	I fixed ctext::deleteHighlighClass so
	that it will now delete regexp classes.
	I had to modify ctext::getHighlightClasses
	and ctext::addHighlightClassForRegexp to
	fix it.  I've decided to keep the package
	provide at 3.1.

3.1.1 - Fri May 23 00:53:39 GMT 2003

	I made some minor changes to configure
	instance handling, so that .t config
	will return the proper values.  Alas I
	decided to add a TODO, because the values
	aren't quite like standard Tk; with the
	resource classes and all.

3.1 - Thu May 22 01:30:41 GMT 2003

	I fixed some bugs on the configure instance
	handling.  I added ctext::buildArgParseTable,
	which improves performance, because now the
	table is only generated once per widget.
	
	I improved cget to accept glob expressions,
	which also fixed a bug with strings like:
	cget -yscroll which didn't match an array
	element, but do match when passed to the
	real text widget.
	
	You can now pass strings like:
	.t config -flag
	
	and the value for -flag will be returned
	even if the flag is special to ctext.
	This took some engineering to get right.

	I fixed a bug in the test files that occured
	due to some fixes.  Basically I'm using list
	now to construct the tagInfo for each highlight
	class.  This caused problems, because I was
	previously using strings.  The test files were
	using escapes to work around the quoting
	problem.  They have been changed and now
	everything should work properly.  You will
	need to lookout for this problem if you
	upgrade.

	I updated REGRESSION.

	The end result is a good release based on
	my testing.

3.1-alpha-5 - Thu May 15 00:39:10 GMT 2003

	I fixed a minor bug in argument handling
	in the configure instance handler.

3.1-alpha-4 - Wed May 14 17:09:32 GMT 2003

	I improved install.tcl by adding more
	information about auto_path.

	I fixed a bug with listbox selection in
	install.tcl (curselection wasn't used).

	I renamed ctext::getClasses to
	ctext::getHighlightClasses.

	I made some uplevel calls list based, so
	that if $win has a space in its path ctext
	will work correctly.

	I made the class creation procs all use
	list for storing items in the arrays.

	I modified ctext::getHighlightClasses to
	return a list in the format of:
	class [list items ...]

	I fixed a bug with
	ctext::addHighlightClassForRegexp.  It
	wasn't storing the $re in the class array.
	This was new to the 3.x series.

3.1-alpha-2-3 - Tue May 13 19:30:51 GMT 2003

	I have redone the configure instance
	handling.  I added -linemap_select_fg
	and -linemap_select_bg.  I have updated
	the README to reflect the new commands
	and options introduced in the 3.x series.
	I have removed the TODO file, because all
	tasks within it have been completed.

	I added an install.tcl script.  It's
	very easy to use and passes all of my
	tests.

	I need to test with Malephiso,
	because there may be minor issues I
	haven't noticed.

3.1-alpha-1 - Mon May 12 23:12:18 GMT 2003

	I've made many changes that have cleaned
	up the code.  I have added -linemap_markable.
	I changed ctext::getAr to accept a suffix.
	I'm now using global variables with a
	__ctext prefix, because it is easier than
	using namespace variables.

	The _blink tag was renamed to __ctext_blink.

	I added ctext::deleteHighlightClass, which
	works with any of the 4 class creators.  It
	needs more testing, but so far it passes
	all of my tests.

	I want to wait about a week or so and go
	over each line of code slowly.  I've tried
	to engineer this well, but typos happen, so...	

	I need to merge more of Andreas Sievers'
	changes and features.

[At this point Andreas Sievers working on ASED
submitted his 3.0 to me and I decided to create
3.1 which merges 2.7-alpha with his work.]

2.7-alpha - Fri May  2 13:08:48 GMT 2003

	I have added -linemap_mark_command with
	an example in ctext_test_interactive.tcl

	I addec ctext::getAr which I'm using to
	store more state information about the
	widget for cget and configure.  I modified
	cget and configure to use it, and they
	are now more useful.
	
	This is an alpha release because I haven't
	tested it much.  I still need to spend
	some time and review the diffs.  I'll
	probably get to that next week, and I'll
	test it with Malephiso (my editor).  I
	should also update the README with
	information about -linemap_mark_command.

2.6.10 - Tue Apr 29 20:47:29 GMT 2003

	I fixed a bug with -font handling in the
	instance command.
	You can now do:
	.t config -font
	and it will change the linemap font as
	well as the main text widget.
	
	I cleaned up argument handling in the
	constructor and instance commands.  They
	now use concat and are simpler.
	
	I added ctext::event:Destroy which now
	takes care of removing an interp alias
	which was missing in previous releases.
	
	interp alias is now used rather than
	eval with a dummy proc for creating an
	instance command.
	
	$win now has a <FocusIn> binding that
	should fix a problem some of you may
	experience.
	You can now do:
	focus $win
	and it will act like:
	focus $win.t
	
	I removed uplevel n eval calls, which
	were pointless.  I didn't realize
	when I wrote them that uplevel acts like
	eval.
			
2.6.9 - Mon Apr 28 16:17:13 GMT 2003

	I fixed a minor focus issue by adding
	-takefocus 0 to the linemap creator.

	I also removed an uplevel #0 for interp
	alias, which wasn't needed.

	I removed the government clause in the
	LICENSE.

	I'm pondering a rewrite of Ctext (yet again)
	which will use SDynObject, and provide more
	features, but the thought "Why fix it if it
	isn't broken?" comes to mind.

2.6.8 - Mon Dec  2 18:24:49 GMT 2002

	I fixed two bugs pointed out by Neil Madden.
	
	The initial creation of the widget failed
	when -linemap 0 was used.
	
	The virtual event <<Modified>> was not occuring.
	----
	I cleaned up several rough areas in the code.
	
	I cleaned up the code in the creation of the
	widget for -yscrollcommand and the linemap.
	
	I cleaned up the code in the configure instance
	command handler.
	
	----
	This release passes all of my tests with
	Tcl/Tk 8.3 and 8.4.  To make debugging easier
	I have added ctext_test_interactive.tcl

2.6.7 - Fri Nov 22 16:39:41 GMT 2002

	I fixed a bug with C comment highlighting.  It
	wasn't updating the highlighting when the
	insertion was just one character.  The problem
	was that the RE didn't match, because the
	previous char and next char were not used to
	decipher the match.
	
	This release was tested with Tcl/Tk 8.4
			
2.6.6 - Thu Aug 22 23:46:14 GMT 2002

	I fixed a serious bug with ctext::matchPair
	and ctext::matchQuote.  The problem was that
	in some cases the pattern )|}|] was causing
	an infinite loop when no other patterns matched.
	It was finding the same character over and over
	again.  This is fixed now.   I'm sorry to anyone
	that was bothered by this.  I found it today with
	Malephiso while editing a test file.  It basically
	locked up my editor.  The long scripts and C code
	I've been editing in the past haven't had this
	problem, due to multiple characters matching.

	Please report BUGS.  I need your help.

2.6.5 - Tue Aug 20 23:27:23 GMT 2002

	I fixed a minor issue with <Destroy> handling.
	A catch was needed to prevent an error
	message, due to several <Destroy> events
	occuring in some cases.


2.6.4 - Tue Jul 23 19:29:49 MDT 2002

	I fixed a minor bug with the linemap updating.
	I didn't notice that with a small number of
	lines it wasn't displaying the line numbers
	properly.

	I fixed a major flaw with 8.4 handling.  The
	8.4 text widget has some new features, and
	the edit instance command wasn't dealing with
	the requests properly.  Now it should, but
	I haven't tested it a lot.


2.6.3 - Fri Jul  5 11:32:42 MDT 2002

	I made improvements to ctext::matchPair that
	should improve the speed.  I also fixed a
	bug that occured with the pattern { \}.
	
	I added an edit modified instance command.
	I'm not sure if it works like the Tk 8.4
	version, but it should work well enough.
	
	I added edit modified tests to ctext_test.tcl
	
	I added -class Ctext to the parent frame.
	Those of you using .Xdefaults may want this.

	I updated the README for edit modified.
	
	It's about time for another study session of
	the code to fix any bugs or potential bugs.

2.6.2 - Mon Jul  1 09:31:39 MDT 2002

	I fixed a bug with <Destroy> handling.

	I removed all calls to variable, and now use
	the fully qualified namespace name for variables.
	This makes the code more concise and cleaner.
	
	I improved the speed of
	ctext::addHighlightClassForSpecialChars by
	using foreach with [split $str ""].

	I added a Destroy button to ctext_test.tcl.

	I removed the -font flags in the test files,
	so it will use what's in the X resources, or
	the default for Tk.

	I improved ctext::matchQuote:blink by doing
	if {$count & 1} rather than if {[expr {$count & 1}]}
	I need to remember that if is like expr.

	I fixed a Doh! in ctext::matchQuote.  I was
	not thinking that the end pos is already known
	due to the switch in the instanceCmd.	

	ctext::matchPair now works.  Try typing a pattern
	of ( ) or [ ] or { } or ( ( ) ) and so on.  It's really
	cool.  Big thanks to Mac Cody for inspiring this.  I
	didn't use any of his code for MatchPair but I looked
	at it to get a general idea.

2.6.1 - Thu Jun 27 10:55:54 MDT 2002

	I added ctext::disableComments and
	ctext::enableComments.  C comment highlighting
	is disabled by default now.  I started merging
	the changes by Mac Cody into this release.  I
	used some of his code for making quotes blink.
	I rewrote some of it to fit more with my ideals.
	I'll be merging more of his great ideas into
	Ctext in the future.

	I fixed a bug with the C comment highlighting.
	I found that \\ was causing problems, so the
	\\\\ RE addition and \\\\ check solves that.

	I replaced func_finder.tcl with a newer file that
	should work better.  What I should probably do is
	write a minimal C parser for dealing with finding
	functions, or do another trick with the C
	preprocessor.

	I updated the README and ctext_test_c.tcl

2.6 - Mon Jun 24 09:39:24 MDT 2002

	I radically modified ctext::comments to fix bugs
	with comments in quotes being highlighted and
	to improve speed.  It is now much faster and
	simpler.  I added -linemapfg and -linemapbg options.
	

2.5.2 - Sun May 19 09:36:16 MDT 2002
	
	I made major changes to how the C commenting works.
	I made a serious mistake with the way that C
	comments were highlighted.  I was invoking
	ctext::comments and there could be several
	after idle timers going that call it that were
	relying on a global array.  Basically my
	state variables were getting clobbered.  It
	took me a while to figure this out.  Now I
	pass a [clock clicks] argument for each call
	and it creates the array if necessary and
	passes the clock clicks value in subsequent
	calls.  The end result is that now several
	ctext::comments loops can be running at
	once and they don't clobber each other.

2.5.1 - Fri Mar 15 17:15:30 MST 2002

	I have added ctext::update which allows you
	to update a cursor or progress dialog while
	Ctext highlights text.  It works quite nicely
	in Malephiso.  I updated the README to
	show the new change, and how to use it.  I
	also fixed a minor error in the README.

2.5 - Sat Mar  2 23:59:07 MST 2002

	I've fixed several critical bugs with deletion
	of text.  I've improved the clarity of the
	code by adding ctext::instanceCmd.  This also
	makes it so that theoretically you could
	overload ctext.  The performance of deletion
	and insertion may be better due to my use of
	a timer for highlighting.

2.4.1 - Sat Feb 23 23:12:49 MST 2002

	I fixed a bug with tag removal that occured
	when text was appended to an existing tag.
	The fix was to use the insert position minus
	one char in the call to ctext::findPreviousSpace.
	

2.4 - Tue Feb  5 16:27:46 MST 2002

	The linemap will now update even if scrolling
	hasn't occured.  I tried to get this working
	in previous releases, but had problems with
	display updates.  Now I use "after 1" with it,
	so it works without blocking the GUI.

	The widget should now completely clean up after
	itself I hope.  I made changes to the <Destroy>
	callback.  Please let me know if it doesn't
	cleanup for you.


2.3.5 - Wed Jan 23 23:55:51 MST 2002

	I fixed a minor bug that caused some text tags
	to be removed when they shouldn't be when deleting
	the first character of a line.
	
	if {[$self._t compare $start < $lineStart]} {
		set start $lineStart
	}	

2.3.4 - Mon Jan 21 22:05:23 MST 2002

	I added | and , to the not chars.  This helps with C
	syntax highlighting.

2.3.3 - Mon Jan 14 23:06:39 MST 2002

	I fixed a bug with C comment highlighting that occured when
	the state of the comment handler was not reset when it reached
	the end of the text widget.  I also fixed a minor bug with
	tag removal in the delete handler.

2.3.2 - Thu Jan 10 19:48:20 MST 2002

	I added " and ' to the not chars in the main highlighting
	engine.  This makes it so that char start strings like
	$blah end at a " or '.  So, for example with $blah" every
	thing would be highlighted like the variable.  Now, it only
	highlights the $blah.

2.3.1 - Fri Jan  4 22:35:19 MST 2002
	
	I fixed a minor bug with the C comment handling.  I now
	have it working very fast for a while, and then it stops
	until being restarted when / or * is found/entered in the
	insert or delete widget instance commands.  There is one
	bug I'm trying to track down where the highlighting stops
	for apparently no reason.  It's probably good enough to
	use for production use in Malephiso, but as usual no warranty
	to you folks.

2.3 - Mon Dec 31 15:18:05 MST 2001

	I have added C comment highlighting.  It works properly
	but it flashes; which can be annoying.  I'm going to work
	on this more later on.

2.2.8 - Mon Dec 31 04:18:57 MST 2001

	I fixed some bugs with the delete instance command.


2.2.7 - Sun Dec 30 18:15:10 MST 2001

	I made changes to ctext::highlight that have improved
	the speed.  They should help a lot with very large files.

2.2.6 - Sun Dec 30 16:28:26 MST 2001

	I improved the search expressions by adding -- to
	deal with - in any of the search strings.  Using
	ctext in Malephiso has caused me to find so many bugs
	that I had no idea about over the past week or so.

2.2.5 - Sun Dec 30 11:10:38 MST 2001

	I fixed a bug with findPreviousSpace and findNextSpace
	which should improve the speed of tag removal, because
	it will no longer remove char tags that it doesn't
	have to.

2.2.4 - Sun Dec 30 10:57:57 MST 2001

	I fixed a bug with the highlighting that occured when
	the whitespace is entered between a highlighted word.

	I also fixed a bug with the linemap that occured when
	an empty line was pressed.

2.2.3 - Mon Dec 24 12:53:49 MST 2001
	
	I added ; to the RE for not chars in the ctext::highlight
	proc.

2.2.2 - Sun Dec 23 14:37:26 MST 2001

	I made a minor change to the highlighting RE, so that
	it handles things like [.widget cget -flag]  Before this
	the -flag part wouldn't have been highlighted.

	I added ctext::clearHighlightClasses which takes only
	one argument; $win.

2.2.1 - Wed Dec 19 10:18:42 MST 2001
	
	I fixed a bug that occured with some text widget commands,
	for example searching with -count.  I had to use uplevel
	in the call to the master text widget.
	

2.2 - Wed Dec 19 06:18:08 MST 2001

	I've fixed some bugs that occured if C functions were being
	highlighted.  I changed addHighlightClassForSpecialChars
	so that it accepts a string of characters to match.
	All addHighlightClass commands now must have a window argument.
	The window argument makes it so that you can now have multiple
	languages highlighted in separate windows.  I added
	ctext::addHighlightClassForRegexp (see the test files for
	examples).
	
	I'm going to write a script for finding all Tcl and Tk
 	flags via an automated search through the man pages.  This
	should hopefully help others with their custom editors
	that use ctext.

2.1.4
	I fixed a few bugs.  Widget destruction should now work
	properly.

2.1.3:
Well, the diff between 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 is huge.  To summarize I've
replaced the list that stored selected linemap lines with an array,
which has improved the performance.  I've added error checking and
done a bunch of cleanup.  I've changed the indentation style.

2.1.2:
LICENSE file added and licensing changed to BSD style.

2.1.1:
replaced addHighlightClass array setting with a list (quoting hell fix)

2.1:
added \r to the tests for the Mac
added \r to the default regexp end of line for the Mac
removed global and replaced with upvar #0
added ctext to the prefix of ToggledList
new ctext_test2.tcl with two ctext widgets
fixed the dos2unix script, so that {lf lf} -translation is used

2.0.2:
fixed a bug with insert calling highlight improperly when pasting/inserting multiple lines
wrote dos2unix to convert from NT's \r\n to \n so that Unix people aren't annoyed.
update idletasks added to delete and insert instance commands

2.0.1:
ctext_test.tcl removed extra ctext test window

2.0-a6:
instance cget -linemap works
added more documentation to Readme.txt

2.0-a5:
removed hardcoded comment highlighting
removed debug output and console show

2.0-a4:
> 50% speedup during ctext::highlight due to a simpler regexp
that uses not ([^ chars]+) instead.

2.0-a3:
fixed bug with cut instance command
added fastdelete and fastinsert instance commands
instance config -linemap and -yscrollcommand work
added highlight instance command
added copy, cut, paste, and append selection instance commands

2.0-a2:
proc ctext::addHighlightClassForSpecialChars
proc ctext::addHighlightClassWithOnlyCharStart
highlight function works
merged delete from 1.1.1 and fixed a bug
insert bug fix
