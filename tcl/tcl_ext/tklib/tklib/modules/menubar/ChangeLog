This checkin includes several major changes to the menubar class.

- The -sync option and functionality were removed.
- The separator type was enhanced to include an optional label.
- A new scope modifier was added to the check and radio button types.
- Four (4) new notebook tab methods were added. These methods are part of
the new scope control code for check and radio buttons.
- The man page was updated to reflect the code changes.
- The demo code was modified to include a notebook with tabs.
- The demo code was modified to demonstrate the use of the new scope control code
- The demo code was modified so the debugging menu items are now on their
own menu and the menu isn't loaded unless a line is uncommented in the
demo code.
- The debug file was updated to include a dump of the notebookVals dict.
