Andreas - heads up!

Channel unstacking can cause a GPF.

The reason is because when your patch was integrated (read re-written) to go
in the core the Unstack channel code was changed so that the underlying
channel is "unlinked" before the top-most channel is Tcl_Close'd

This causes you to deref NULL in Downchannel function......

I don't have a solution right now (appart from not using unstack) but I
thought you might like to know about this one!!
