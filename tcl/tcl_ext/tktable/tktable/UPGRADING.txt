For those users who became familiar with v1.x of tkTable, there are
several changes in v2.x that might affect you.  If v2.x is new to you,
then just read the man page (or HTML equivalent).

The format of this upgrade document is to define the area of the change and
the show the old code and its new equivalent.  Comments may follow for
seemingly obscure changes.  Not all the new features are listed (we just
want you to be able to upgrade old code), so don't forget to look through
the documentation for new procedures that will make previous tasks easier.

METHOD CHANGES:

* new "window" method for embedded windows

MISC CHANGES:

* No more explicit Kanji or incr Tcl support.  Kanji support comes
  with using the new core Unicode support, and incr Tcl v3.0 for Tcl8
  is just another loadable library.

* -rowheight now supports line and pixel sizes, but positive
  numbers now mean size in lines instead of pixels.

* <Return> binding now puts a \n into the cell instead of moving
  to the next cell

* -batchmode no longer supported.  It's purpose was regularly
  misconstrued.  User probably wants "-drawmode slow" instead.
