KitViewer                                                         October 2000
==============================================================================


This is the source code release of KitViewer, a generic Metakit database file
viewer.  Metakit embedded database engine.

KitViewer is a Windows 95/98/NT utility, built with Borland C++ Builder 4.0.

This version is based on Metakit 2.3.3, it can read "older" v1.0 .. v2.01
datafiles as well as the new v2.3 format.

All Metakit sources are inluded in the "kvborb40.bpg" project group.  If you
have BCB4 installed, just double click and build the binary with CTRL/F9.

The "official" (ho, hum) version of KitViewer has been compressed with UPX,
see http://upx.tsx.org for details about this impressive exe compressor.

If you make changes to KitViewer, you must omit the Equi4 Software logo, and
you must leave an acknowledgement with my name in the About box - please...
Details about the amazing qualities of Metakit are ok, but not required :)
