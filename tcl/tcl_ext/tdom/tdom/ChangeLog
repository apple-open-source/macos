2004-07-19  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.pointsman.de>

        * generic/domxslt.c: Better error msg in case of XML parsing
          errors in external entities.

        * generic/nodecmd.c: Bug fix: Check, if refnode given to
          insertBeforeFromScript is valid.   
    
2004-07-13  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/domxslt.c: Ensure, that the first element node of
          the result tree is the documentElement of the generated
          document.  

        * tests/xmlsimple.test
        * generic/xmlsimple.c: Empty CDATA sections should not create
          a node.
  
2004-07-08  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>
        
        * generic/tdominit.c: Test, if a non-mt tDOM is tried to load
          into a mt tclsh.

        * generic/dom.c
        * generic/dom.h
        * generic/nodecmd.h
        * generic/nodecmd.c: Added isPIName, isComment, isCDATA and
          isPIValue method to the dom command. Created new global
          (thread wide) flags for name and value checks (Names and FQ
          Names (element, attribute and processing instruction names),
          text nodes, comments, CDATA sections and processing
          instruction values). New methods setNameCheck and
          setTextCheck to control this flags. 

        * generic/nodecmd.c: Bug fix in case of 
          appendFromScript script.

        * generic/domxslt.c: Uses the new domIsComment, domIsPINAME
          and domIsPIValue API functions of dom.c. Improved
          xsl:processing-instruction processing (now instantiating the
          content).

        * generic/domxpath.c: Minor editorial changes.

        * tests/domCmd.test: Deleted this file, moved the tests to
          the new dom.test or domDoc.test.

        * tests/dom.test: Moved the tests from this file to the new
          domNode.test and collected dom command tests here.

        * tests/domDoc.test
        * tests/domNode.test: Created this files, tests from dom.test
          and domCmd.test.

2004-05-11  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * apps/xslt.tcl: Fixed the test for running in a source tree
          with tcldomsh. (doh!)

2004-05-08  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/xmlsimple.c: Removed superfluous arg baseURI from
          XML_SimpleParse().

        * generic/domhtml.c
        * tests/htmlreader.test: Fixed html-2.1 and html-2.2. (This
          html reader is crusty stuff...)

2004-03-26  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/domxpath.c: Fix of the template priority calculation
          and clearing out of xpathGetPrio().

2004-03-14  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/xmlsimple.c: Fixed a few simple parser seg faults in
          case of not-wf input. See xmlconf/xmltest/not-wf/sa/022.xml,
          xmlconf/xmltest/not-wf/sa/042.xml for examples.

        * Makefile.in
        * extensions/tdomhtml/pkgIndex.tcl.in
        * extensions/tnc/Makefile.in: Doh! Undo the last changes; I
          fixed this already 2003-10-12.

        * generic/dom.c: Removed superfluous comma from the
          tdomMethod enum, which bothered the AIX xlc compiler.

        * generic/domxpath.c: Editorial change: Removed some
          superfluous casts to (char*) from tdomstrdup result - its
          defined to return char*.
  
        * generic/domxpath.h
        * generic/domxpath.c
        * tests/xslt.test
        * generic/domxslt.c: Implemented the special constraints on
          certain xpath pattern/expr (no current() func in pattern, no
          var references in template and key match pattern and key use
          expr, no key() func in key match pattern and use expr.)

        * extensions/tnc/pkgIndex.tcl.in
        * extensions/tdomhtml/pkgIndex.tcl.in
        * extensions/example/pkgIndex.tcl.in: Bug fix: Protect against
          spaces in the path to the package.

2003-12-20  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * win/pkgIndex.tcl: Also updated to new version nr 0.8.0.
    
2003-12-17  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * doc/domNode.*
        * generic/tcldom.c: Added baseURI method, which returns the
          current base URI and has an optional argument to set the
          base URI. (The getBaseURI is deprecated.)

2003-12-15  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/dom.c
        * generic/domxslt.c: More fixes to ensure ns integrity of xslt
          result trees.

2003-12-14  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * tests/attribute.text: Made test results independent from the
          (undefined) order of [array get].

        * tests/dom.test: Build expected result of some tests with
          [list], instead of providing a string rep. This hides the
          changes in list string rep by TIP 148, so that the tests
          work both with pre- and post TIP 148 tcl.

2003-12-11  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * tests/xslt.test
        * generic/domxpath.c: Bug fix: double mem free in case of
          pattern w/ FQ element with positional dependent predicate.

        * generic/dom.c
        * tests/domCmd.test
        * tests/pcdata.test
        * tests/tdomcmd.test
        * generic/tclexpat.c: Bug fix: Don't quash white space of non
          white space only content in trim mode.

2003-12-09  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * lib/tdom.tcl: Improved regexp to extract encoding. Corrected
          typo.        
    
        * generic/domxslt.c
        * generic/domxpath.c
        * generic/dom.c: Bug fix in namespace handling: copy-of from
          result tree fragments could mess up ns handling, if a
          default namespace is already in scope in the result tree.

2003-12-08  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * win/makefile.vc
        * win/makefile805.vc: Also updated to verson nr. 0.8.0.

2003-11-28  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/tcldom.c: Switched back to Tcl_Panic() in one case,
          to make MT builds work.

        * generic/domxslt.c
        * generic/dom.c: With MT tDOM, a domDoc extRefHandler
          script may be used within another thread.

2003-11-27  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/domxslt.c
        * generic/dom.c
        * tests/xslt.tests: Another fix, to ensure namespace integrity
          of the result doc.

2003-11-26  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/domxslt.c
        * tests/xslt.test: Fix, to ensure namespace integrity of the
          result doc. Fixed parentNode of documentElement and siblings
          of the result tree.

2003-11-24  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * tests/tdomcmd.test: Added this file.

        * generic/dom.c
        * tests/dom.test: Don't include PIs inside the internal subset
          into the tree.

        * generic/tcldom.c
        * generic/dom.h
        * generic/domxslt.c
        * tests/xslt.test
        * generic/dom.c: Added domDoc methods omit-xml-declaration,
          indent, standalone, encoding and mediaType.
          
        * generic/tclexpat.c
        * generic/tclexpat.h  
        * generic/dom.c: Changed parserObj behavior: parser don't need
          a reset call after a final parse or parsing error.
          
        * tests/xslt.test  
        * generic/domxslt.c: Bug fix: seg fault for document('') with
          stylesheet tree with empty baseURI. Minor
          optimizations. Fixed invalid memory read.

        * generic/tcldom.c
        * tests/dom.test: (Probably) temporarily disabled
          automatically clean up of nodeObjCmds, to work around bug:
          Storing the same node in different evaluation contexts with
          the optional objVar argument (as in [$doc documentElement
          root]) at the same time did not work.

        * generic/domxpath.c: Fixed a mem leak with some sum() calls
          with NaN result. Fixed invalid memory read.

        * generic/tcldom.c: Fixed mem leak with
          -externalentitycommand. Fixed mem leak with parsing xml
          document with external entity and parsing error in an
          external entity. Minor code clean up. 
          
        * tests/parser.test:  
        * generic/tclexpat.c: Fixed memory problem, if handler script
          return TCL_ERROR. Made the cget method work for the parser
          related options, even if there are no handler scripts set.

        * generic/tcldom.c  
        * generic/dom.c
        * generic/tclexpat.c
        * generic/domlock.c: Always use domPanic as panic function.  

2003-11-20  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>
         
        * generic/domxslt.c: Bug fix: Setting a top-level xslt param
          with -parameters and using this param for setting another
          top level var could end in seg fauld.

2003-11-10  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/tcldom.c: Replaced a C++ style comment with a C
          style comment.
    
2003-11-02  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * tests/xpath.test: Added a few tests related to declarations
          to chapter 4.2 and 4.4 in the errata to the XPath rec.

        * generic/domxpath.h: Fixed memory leak, if floor or ceiling
          are called with non-numbers.

2003-11-01  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/domxslt.c: Minor bug fix: Special handling is
          needed, if xsl:copy-of is used, to copy namespace nodes.

2003-10-26  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>
        
        * apps/xslt.tcl: Removed not needed code.

        * generic/dom.c
        * tests/dom.test: Bug fix: Under some circumstances it was
          possible, that an URI change for a subtree was not stored in
          the tree (resulting in wrong base URI for that nodes).

        * generic/domxpath.c: number() bug fix: Now works according to
          the XPath rec understanding of a Number, not with the libc
          understanding of a double.

        * generic/domxpath.c
        * generic/dom.h
        * generic/dom.domxslt.c: Globalized the macro IS_XML_WHITESPACE.

2003-10-24  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/domxslt.c: Bug fix for document() func, if called
          with 2 args and first arg evaluates to the empty
          string. Improved error reporting, if an XSLT variable is
          tried to reset, although there is already such a variable in
          scope: now the name of the var is also reported in the error
          msg.

        * apps/xslt.tcl: Updated to use the new asText option.

2003-10-23  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * expat/*
        * CHANGES: Update to expat 1.95.7.
    
2003-10-22  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/domxpath.c
        * tests/xpath.test: Bug fix in the xpath lexer: In a union
          expr, a NCName test with a name equal to an operator was
          wrongly interpreted as operator.
    
2003-10-21  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/domxslt.c: Fixed bug with current(), if it is used
          in the select expr of an xsl:sort.

        * generic/domxpath.c
        * generic/domxpath.h
        * generic/domxslt.c: Changed handling of key node sets. It's a
          somewhat focused optimization, for the price of a very small
          overall cost. I've done it anyway, because it's a very
          notable speed up for an important xslt pattern (the so
          called Muenchian Method for grouping). 

        * generic/tcldom.c: Removed two unused variables.

2003-10-17  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/dom.c: Fixed dom parse -channel option, which got
          accidentally broken, due to the lately switch from
          Tcl_GetStringFromObj() to Tcl_GetString().

        * generic/tcldom.c: Added again some recently implemented methods to
          domObj_usage and node_usage, which got accidentally removed
          by the lately editorial changes.

2003-10-16  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zv@archiware.com>

	* generic/tcldom.c: added "dom detachDocument" command
	  to match the already present "dom attachDocument".
	  This is used only for threaded tdom builds.

	* generic/domlock.c: changed lock caching to accomodate for
	  situation with huge number of created documnents
	
	  Also, added new "domDoc" command as a first-class tdom citizen,
	  analogous to the already existing "domNode". It operates on the
	  document token.

	  Attempt has been made to start to follow Tcl-style-guide
	  but we still have a way to go. The first thing is to try
	  to force the 78-chars margin where possible/feasible.
	  Therefore, many of the source files have been cosmetically
	  touched, without code or functionality changes.

2003-10-12  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/domxpath.c
        * generic/domxslt.c: Removed not used vars.

        * generic/dom.c
        * generic/dom.h
        * generic/domhtml.c

        * generic/tclexpat.c
        * generic/tclexpat.h
        * generic/xmlsimple.c: Merged domCreateEmptyDoc() and
          domCreateDoc(), now there is only one API proc:
          domCreateDoc().

2003-10-10  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * Makefile.in
        * extensions/tdomhtml/pkgIndex.tcl.in
        * extensions/tnc/Makefile.in: Fixed pkgIndex.tcl problem, if
          the path to the packages contains a space.

        * doc/domDoc.*
        * doc/domNode.*
        * CHANGES  
        * generic/dom.h
        * generic/dom.c
        * generic/tcldom.c
        * tests/domCmd.test: Added implementation for new method
          normalize (and as a by-product a C implementation for the
          method appendData).

2003-10-09  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * tests/domCmd.test    
        * generic/tcldom.c: Made code robust against renaming of
          domDoc cmds (well, unlikely, not to say very unlikely, but
          at least it also simplified code and reduces obj size by a
          few bytes). Changed sharedDocs hash table (only MT build)
          from TCL_STRING_KEYS to TCL_ONE_WORD_KEYS.

2003-10-08  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/tcldom.c: Fixed the preliminary (and MT only) method
          renumber.

2003-10-07  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/nodecmd.c
        * generic/nodecmd.h
        * generic/tcldom.c
        * tests/dom.test
        * doc/domNode.*
        * CHANGES: Added new method insertBeforeFromScript to
          domNodes. Bug fixes for appendFromScript: In case of error
          in the script, the tree will not be altered. The
          appendFromScript may only be used for ELEMENT_NODEs.

2003-10-04  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/domxpath.h: Removed prototypes of functions, which
          are not implemented. Editorial changes.

        * generic/domxpath.h
        * generic/domxpath.c
        * generic/domxslt.c

        * tests/domCmd.test
        * CHANGES
        * doc/domDoc.*
        * doc/domNode.*: Added new method 'asText' to domDocs and
          domNodes. Renamed xpathGetTextValue() to
          xpathGetStringValue(), to be more according to the vocabular
          of the XPath rec.

2003-10-01  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>
        
        * generic/dom.c: Removed unnecessary check of 
          domModuleIsInitialized in domReadDocument(). Corrected typo
          in a comment.

        * generic/dom.c
        * generic/dom.h
        * generic/domxpath.c
        * generic/domxslt.c
        * generic/tcldom.c
        * tests/dom.test: Reworked usage of nodeNumber. It is now used
          only in one place, the new domPrecedes function. Also in
          domPrecedes is a fall-back mechanism, which is used if the
          document has an invalid node numbering. Removed the forced
          re-numbering in case of invalid node numbering of the doc
          for every single selectNodes. Added preliminary method
          renumber for MT-enabled builds. Carefully reviewed every
          rsAddNode usage in domxpath.c. Some minor editorial
          changes.

2003-09-28  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/tclexpat.c: Removed two unused vars.

        * tests/domnamespace.test
        * generic/dom.h: Changed type of domNameSpaceIndex, domNodeFlags,
          domAttrFlags, domDocFlags and info in dom*Node structs from
          int to unsigned int. This fixes bug with docs with more than
          128 different namespaces.

        * tests/xpath.test
        * generic/domxpath.c: Bug fix: preceding-sibling axes could
          give wrong results in case the context node is a child of
          rootNode (e.g the documentElement).

        * tests/dom.test
        * generic/tcldom.c
        * generic/dom.c: Bug fix for replaceChild: If the node to
          replace was wrong, the doc got mangled. Bug fix for
          appendChild, replaceChild: the new node could not be a
          sibling or child of node. Speed improvment in some cases for
          removeChild, replaceChild, appendChild.

        * tests/dom.test
        * doc/domNode.*
        * generic/tcldom.c
        * generic/dom.c: Reworked insertBefore: Bug fix: If the
          refNode was invalid, the involved documents got mangled. Bug
          fix: Dead loop, if the node to insert was the node
          itself. Bug fix: the rootNode of node's document could be
          used as node to insert. Bug fix: It was not possible, to
          insert a node before refNode, which was already a children
          of node. Bug fix: It was not possible, to insert a sibling
          of node. Feature enhancement: If the refnode is the empty
          string, the newNode is inserted at the end of the children
          list of node. Optimization: Average speed was O(n/2) (n:
          number of childs of node) in case the node to insert was out
          of the tree, and 0((n+m)/2) (m: number of nodes in the
          fragments list) in case the node to insert was out of the
          fragments list. Now its O(1). 

        * tests/dom.test: Removed 'knownBug' constraint from two
          tests, which documented known bugs, that are fixed in the
          meantime.

        * tests/parser.test: Added a few tests related to the new
          flexibility of the -elementstartcommand, -elementendcommand
          and -characterdatacommand scripts.
          
        * doc/expat.*: Added documentation for the now implemented
          cget method. Added information about the default for the
          -paramentityparsing option.
  
        * generic/tclexpat.c
        * generic/tclexpat.h: Enhanced the new cget method of
          parserObjs to also report the state of -noexpand,
          -useForeignDTD, -paramentityparsing (those by doing the
          bookkeeping with an enhanced TclGenExpatInfo struct, because
          the expat parser do not proived an API to request this
          settings) and -namespace. Improved argument check of the
          parser obj method calls. Optimization for calling handler
          scripts.

2003-09-16  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	* Makefile.in: added SHLIB_CFLAGS to set of compiler
	  switches in order to silence the picky linker.

2003-09-14  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * lib/tdom.tcl: Fixed scripting bugs in
          ::dom::domDoc::importNode and ::dom::domNode::length    

        * Makefile.in: dist target: Don't include CVS dirs and hidden
          files into the distribution file.
          
2003-09-14  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	* Makefile.in
	* configure
	* configure.in: made more TEA-2 compatible by moving the
	  tcldomsh target out. Also, honour the MATH_LIBS as
	  calculated by the tcl.m4 instead of plumbing our own.
	  Also, fixed "make dist" to produce distribution file.

	* tclconfig/ChangeLog
	* tclconfig/tcl.m4: imported fresh new versions from SF

	* unix/CONFIG: cleanup
	* macosx/README: cleanup

2003-09-14  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        Merged fixes from 0.7.8 into HEAD. This includes:

        2003-08-06  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

        	* generic/nodecmd.c: removed optimized domAppendChild1
        	  in favour of generic domAppendChild since former was
        	  trashing memory in certain situations.

        2003-08-06  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

                * tests/all.tcl
                * tests/domCmd.test: Added contraint need_uri, so that
                  the few tests, which needs the tcllib uri package
                  are skipped, if the uri package isn't present.

        2003-07-06  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

                * generic/tclexpat.c: Fixed bug in the subtree skipping
                  feature of event handlers. Should be merged with HEAD.

                * lib/tdom.tcl: Fixed error reporting in
                  tDOM::extRefHandler.

        2003-07-03  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

        	* generic/domlock.c: fixed double mutex unlock.

        	* generic/tcldom.c: allows same thread to issue several
        	  "attachDocument" commands to artificially bump the 
                  document refcount thus making the document sticky.
        	  
        	  Also, fixed variable tracing issues when tearing down the
        	  dom document. Now, all node object command variables are
        	  automatically untraced. This prevents memory trashing when
        	  such variables are unset by user or by Tcl.


2003-09-14  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>
        
        * generic/tclexpat.c: Added cget method implementation for all
          parser options with the exceptions of -namespace,
          -useForeignDTD and -paramentityparsing. Revamped behind the
          scene code for handling of the -elementstartcommand,
         -elementendcommand and -characterdatacommand options. Up to
          now, the arguments to this options must have been the name
          of an already defined tcl proc. This allowed a special high
          performance calling of that procs. The new code behaves
          exactly the same way for every script, which worked with
          previous versions. Additionally it allows, to specify a not
          already defined tcl proc and, probably more important,
          allows 'arbitrary' tcl scripts as argument to that
          options. All in this checkin in the work of Harry Moreau
          (hmoreau@online.ie). Many thanks for this contribution.

2003-06-13  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/tcldom.c: Added an argument check for XSLTCmds.

2003-06-11  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/domxslt.c: Fixed a bug in xsl:number. If there is no
          'count' attribute given to xsl:number, it must default to
          the pattern that matches any node with the same node type as
          the current node and, if the current node has an
          expanded-name, with the same expanded-name as the current
          node. But in case of PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODEs as the
          current node and no 'count' attribute, it counted all pi's
          regardless of the name. Now, the name is respected, as it
          should be.
    
2003-06-11  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	* generic/domlock.c: fixed double mutex unlock.

2003-05-19  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * doc/dom.*: Corrected the documentation of the
          createDocumentNS method: the args uri and docElementName
          were documented in the wrong order (reported by Vico
          Klump). Minor markup changes.

2003-05-16  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	* generic/dom.h 
	* generic/tdom.decls
	* generic/tdomDecls.h
	* generic/tdomStubInit.c 
	* generic/tdomStubLib.c 
	* generic/tdominit.c: fixed so it compiles cleanly when 
	  -NS_AOLSERVER is defined.

2003-05-16  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/dom.h
	* generic/tcldom.c
	* generic/domxslt.c
	* generic/tclexpat.c: Switched to use XML_ParserCreate_MM(), to be
	  able (at tDOM build time) to make the expat parser use custom
	  *alloc/free() functions (macro MEM_SUITE in dom.h). For
	  TCL_MEM_DEBUG and NS_AOLSERVER builds the mem functions, used by
	  the parser default now to Tcl_Alloc()/Tcl_Realloc()/Tcl_Free().
	  Switched to XML_FreeContentModel(), for freeing stored element
	  content models.

2003-05-11  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/dom.c
        * generic/domxslt.c
        * generic/xmlsimple.c: Renamed the documents rootNode (in the
          sense of the XPath data model, that is not the document
          element) from "(rootNode)" to "", in preparation for the
          promissed 'domDoc without documentElement' feature, to fix a
          somewhat outlying problem with xslt numbering and because
          it's clearly more the 'right thing' according to the rec.

        * generic/domxslt.c: Removed the arg xs from
          sortNodeSetFastMerge(), because it isn't used.

2003-04-20  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * extensions/tdomhtml/tdomhtml.tcl: Proc newdoc: New optional
          argument (list of names of local variables) allows the use
          of local variables (in the scope of the caller of newdoc) in
          the script argument of newdoc. Contributed by Chuck Ferril.

2003-04-16  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/domxslt.c: Optimization: Improved caching of
          external documents.

2003-04-09  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/dom.c: Fixed a bug in the creation of the error msg
          in case of parsing errors in an external entity.

        * generic/dom.c
        * generic/dom.h
        * generic/domxslt.c
        * tests/domCmd.test
        * doc/dom.*
        * generic/tcldom.c: Added option -paramentityparsing to the
          [dom parse] method. [dom parse] option parsing now uses
          Tcl_GetIndexFromObj() (which additionally fixes a minor bug
          with the current option parsing).
        
        * generic/tcldom.c: Removed an unused variable. Improved error
          reporting in case of not found attribute. Better options
          check for the 'xslt' methods. Changed implementation of the
          dom method isQName to use the lately introduced API function
          domIsQNAME.

        * generic/tclexpat.c
          tests/parser.test: Fixed a bug in the value parsing of the
          -paramentityparsing option.

        * tests/domCmd.test: Added tests for the interface of the
          xsltCmds.

        * tests/xpath.test: Added test which documents the bug prior
          to domxpath.c r1.63.  
  
        * doc/dom.*: Added 'package require tdom' to the syntax
          decription (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tdom/message/446)

        * doc/domDoc.*: Added documentation for the toXSLTcmd method
          and the resulting xsltCmds. Corrected the documentation for
          the xslt method (missed -ignoreUndeclaredParameters and
          -xsltmessagecmd in the method syntax).  
          
2003-04-05  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/tclexpat.c: Bug fix: If the parsing state is already
          not TCL_OK return in the notstandalonehandler immediately
          success, otherwise the error msg will be overwritten with a
          false diagnostic. A few editorial changes.

2003-04-04  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/dom.c 
        * generic/dom.h: Added domIsQNAME.

        * generic/dom.c: Bug fix: For textNodes getLine/getColumn
          method report the position of the first char of the text
          node.

        * generic/domxpath.c: Bug fix: Detects now some erroneous
          XPath expressions. Added parameter number check to XPath
          functions substring and concat (the last two XPath
          functions, without such check, they must have slipped thou
          somehow, up to now).

        * generic/domxslt.c: Improved interal function reportError(),
          can now be used with all kind of nodes not only element
          nodes. Improved behavior in case of dubious numbering
          (negative roman number or latin letters fall back to default
          latin numbers). Fixed a potential memory leak (in case of
          overwriting named templates without match attribute with an
          other named template). Improved error reports: for more
          detected errors there is now a line/column number
          given. Plenty of improvements in detecting erroneous
          stylesheets: more checks for format-number formatting
          patters (although especically format-number patterns are
          still a can of worms), added parameter number check for
          additional XPath function current(), template, paramter,
          variable, sort, choose, copy, and message elements.

2003-03-26  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>
        
        * generic/domxslt.c: Fixed some memory problems, mostly in
          case of erroneous stylesheets.

          msg.

        * generic/dom.c: Fixed a mem leak in handling external

          and expat.

        * generic/domxslt.c: Fixed several potential memory leaks
          while processing erroneous stylesheets. Bug fix: added
          missing memory clean to grouping-separator/grouping-size
          support.

        * generic/tcldom.c: Fixed potential memory problem while
          processing erroneous stylesheet. Improved error msg in
          case of script errors in the -externalentitycommand
          script.

        * doc/domNode.*
        * tests/dom.test

          relative order of two nodes out of the same document.
  
        * generic/nodecmd.c: Added explicit memory clean up of the
          nodecmd stack, to reduce 'noice' while memory leak
          debugging.

        * tests/dom.test: Added a reminder for a minor known memory
          problem.  

        * tests/data/mondial-europe.xml: Added this file (used by the
          usage example of xe).

          mondial-europe.xml.
  
2003-03-19  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	* Makefile.in: installs the tdomConfig.sh into the
	  $(libdir) whatever that points to.

2003-03-08  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	* expt/internal.h: disabled FASTCALL & friends
	  since those do not work anywhere, as of my knowledge.

2003-03-06  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	* generic/domalloc.c: removed include malloc.h since 
	  not needed nor not found on macosx

	* configure.in: adds "-lm" even when linking the shared image
	  since Starkit users need that. Also, fixed alternative libdir
	  usage when installing in non-standard (user-given) location.

	* unix/CONFIG: new file. Adds some examples how to build
	  the extension on some common Unix platforms.

	* mac: added Bernards CodeWarrior files for Mac builds.
	* macosx: added directory where we will supply the ProjectBuilder
	  files (hopefully :)

2003-03-03  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * tests/dom.test    
        * generic/tcldom.c: Fixed bug with using the 'domNode' cmd
          without argument (spotted by Bernard Desgraupes).

2003-02-27  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/domxslt.c: xsl:number attributes grouping-separator
          and grouping-size now also interpreted as attribute value
          templates. (The last two (missing up to now only by mistake)
          attribute value templates under the recognized xsl
          attributes.) 

2003-02-26  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/tcldom.c: Removed unused variables.

        * lib/tdom.tcl
          generic/dom.c: Improved ::tDOM::xml(Read|Open)File. Now
          handles also utf-16 files with BOM right.

        * generic/domxslt.c: Made some functions static. Removed a
          TODO note, which already was done. Improved some error msgs
          (now with line/column info, if avaliable). Bug fix:
          xsltXPathFuncs must return -1 to signal error, because if
          the source of the function call was inside of domxslt.c the
          result code (rc) check rule is rc < 0. Fixed text in a
          xsl:attribute error msg. Fixed memory leak in error case in
          ExecAction, case forEach. Added a missing result code check
          in ExecAction, case procinstr. Bug fix: Even literal result
          element subtrees are relevant for xslt variable scope
          (default case of ExecAction). Bug fix: the expression
          context of the match expr of a xsl:template is the
          xsl:template node. Now the xslt white space stripping is
          done before the top level processing (was done after
          toplevel processing).

        * expat/VERSION

          from gcc on Solaris.

          extensions/tnc/tests/tnc.test: Started test suite for the
          tcl interface of the tnc command and the validator
          commands. 
        
        * generic/tclexpat.c: Better eContents cleanup. Bug fix: of
          course we have to call the parserResetProcs of the
          registered C handler sets while reseting the expat parser
          command.

        * lib/tdom.tcl: Smaller fixes. Changed the values of the
          system-properties xsl:vendor (included me) and
          xsl:vendor-url (to http://www.tdom.org).
  
2003-02-22  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	* generic/dom.h: Added (char*) cast to argument of Tcl_Free
	  in the FREE macro. This avoids some compiler warnings.
	* generic/dom.c: Added some typecasts to MALLOC to avoid
	  compiler warnings.

2003-02-21  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/domxslt.c: Bug fixes: Return after detecting the
          error (xsltPathFuncs), ensure that savedLastNode is always
          set right (ExecAction, case copy). Editorial changes.

        * configure.in
        * Makefile.in
        * configure
        * configure-tcl8.0.5: Don't remove tdomConfig.sh with a 'make
          clean', only with a 'make distclean'.
    
2003-02-09  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * expat/*: Update to expat 1.95.6.

        * apps/xslt.tcl: Updated to use the new -xsltmessagecmd option
          of the xslt method and the -doctypeDeclaration of the
          asXML/asHTML methods. Added a few comments.

        * doc/domDoc.*
        * tests/domCmd.test: Public and system identifier information
          are now stored (if parsed with the expat parser or generated
          by the xslt engine, if given), exposed to the script level
          (even writable, more than DOM 2 allows) and will be, on
          demand, respected while serializing.

        * generic/dom.c: Bug fix: Hold ID => node mapping consistent
          even after resetting or removal of known ID attributes.

        * generic/domxslt.c: Bug fix: invalid memory read.
  
        * generic/tcldom.c: Bug fix: invalid memory read.

        * generic/dom.c
        * generic/tcldom.c
        * generic/xmlsimple.c
        * tests/xslt.tests: Fixed bug reported by Wilhelm Klink
          (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tdom/message/404 see test
          xslt-4.1). Again a problem (sideeffect) of renumbering
          node->nodeNumber (which is necessary after modification of
          the tree for some XPath expr to work). The keys of the
          entries in the baseURIs hash table of the documents where
          the nodeNumber of the (subtree root) nodes with new
          baseURI. Since this nodeNumber isn't necessarily constant
          over the lifetime of a node (because of the possibility of
          re-numbering the tree), this could not work anymore. Instead
          the nodeNumber, we now use the pointer to the node structure
          as Key for the baseURIs hash table. This pointers stay
          always constant, even if the nodeNumber changes. Additional
          code was added to domFreeNode(), to ensure, that an entry in
          the baseURIs hash table gets freed, if the related node is
          in deed freed. Removed the yesterday added reseting of the
          domUniqueNodeNr counter, because it turned out in testing,
          that there are problems with sorting of resultSets, which
          includes nodes from different documents (which may happen
          with some special XSLT constructs (document() calls with a
          nodeset as argument)). The reseting of the domUniqueNodeNr
          is still desirable, but it turned out, that it should be
          carefully considered, when it should be done.

2003-01-29  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/dom.c
        * generic/tcldom.c
        * tests/xslt.test: Changed escaping of serialized XML. The
          previous behavior wasn't 'wrong', but now we do it along the
          lines of almost all other (important) tools and it seems
          there's al least some xslt code out there, which banks on
          this 'common' way of serializing. Though, there is a small
          risk, that this is an incompatible change for a few users.

        * generic/dom.c
        * generic/dom.h
        * generic/xmlsimple.c
        * tests/dom.test: Fixed the problem of 'changing node
          references' under some circumstances (reported by Wilhelm
          Klink). This also decrease the possibility of a potential
          problem for extremely long running single threaded tDOM
          applications.

        * generic/dom.c
        * generic/tcldom.c
        * tests/dom.test: Fix for the problem with ownerDocument
          reported by Oleg Oleinick (see test dom-29.1).

        * generic/tcldom.c
        * tests/dom.test: Fixed bug with COMMENT_NODEs while using the
          asList method (problem reported by Ramon Ribó). While at it,
          also added code for handling processing instructions, which
          was also missing, up to now.

2003-01-11  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/dom.c

        * generic/domxslt.c
        * generic/domxslt.h
        * generic/tcldom.c: Added conversion of XSLT stylesheet DOM
          trees to 'cached' xslt cmds (new domDoc method
          toXSLTcmd). Works for non threaded tcl; needs additional
          work for multi-threaded tcl and documentation.

        * generic/domxslt.c: Fixed a bug introduced during rework of
          the white space stripping for XML sources.

        * generic/tclexpat.c: Editorial change (Typo in comment)

        * generic/tcldom.h: Editorial changes.

2002-12-23  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/domxslt.c: Reworked the white space stripping for XML
          sources a bit. Better white space handling in token lists.

2002-12-21  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/domxpath.c: Fixed the changes by me in rev. 1.60 in
          the XPath Lexer.

2002-12-20  Zoran Vasiljevic  (zoran@archiware.com)

	* generic/tcldom.c
	* generic/dom.c
	* generic/domxpath.c
	* generic/domalloc.c
	* generic/domhtml.c
	* generic/docxpath.c: added DBG macro arround some fprintf's

2002-11-28  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/domxslt.c: Reuse already parsed trees only if it is
          requested again for the same matter (as stylesheet or as
          source dir), otherwise create a new tree, because of the
          different white space stripping rules for stylesheets and
          source documents.    

2002-11-27  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>
         
        * win/makefile805.vc: Added this file. VC++ 6.0 makefile to
          compile against tcl8.0.5, contributed by Sumit Pokhariyal.

        * generic/domxpath.c: FQ names with a localname equal to a
          XPath 'keyword' (for example ns1:div) are now recognized as
          node test (they raised error up to now). Changed
          generate-id() to return the more generic named 'id<idstr>'
          instead of the up to now used 'node<idstr>'.

--- Release 0.7.5, 27. Nov. 2002 ---

2002-11-24  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * Makefile.in: Changed the order of the include dirs, to avoid
          clash with tcldom.h out of TclDOM-2.4, which will be
          installed in the same directory as tcl.h

2002-11-22  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * configure-tcl8.0.5: Added this file. Special configure for
          Tcl8.0.5 users.
        
        * README: Updated notes for Tcl8.0.5 users.  

2002-11-21  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * doc/expat.*: We don't have a 'provide expat' anymore, it's
          all tdom. Fixed a typo.

2002-11-17  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/domxslt.c: Report error, if xsl:import elements not
          come first.

        * doc/tnc.*: Better wording.
  
2002-11-16  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * win/makefile.vc
        * extensions/tnc/makefile.vc: A bit final tweaking for 0.7.5.    

2002-11-16  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	* generic/dom.h
	* generic/dom.c
	* generic/tcldom.c
	* generic/tclStubLib.c: fixed references to panic (now Tcl_Panic)
	  Also, fixed some 8.0.5 compilation issues.

        * README: added some 8.0.5 compilation notes

2002-11-16  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/tcldom.c: Fixed bugs, which only raised there head
          if compiled against tcl8.0.5.

        * tests/all.tcl  
        * tests/loadtdom.tcl
        * tests/domCmd.test
        * tests/domnamespace.test
        * tests/htmlreader.test
        * tests/i18n.test
        * tests/xmlsimple.test
        * tests/xslt.test: Made test suite also running under
          tcl8.0.5. Added constraint to the tests, which uses i18n tcl
          features.
        
        * doc/tnc.xml
        * doc/tnc.html
        * doc/tnc.n: Updated documentation.  

2002-11-15  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	* generic/dom.h: added IS_DELETED node flag
	  Changed domFreeNode to accept one additional parameter.
	  This parameter is used to signal the function to 
	  perform node-walk and invoke user-supplied callback w/o
	  actually freeing the node. This functionality is required
	  for example when a thread detaches from the shared DOM tree
	  and wants to detach all eventual node commands from its
	  interpreter.
 	  Added "struct domNode *deletedNodes" in the document structure
	  This is the head of all nodes spliced out of the tree but not
	  yet free'd. This is needed in order to avoid memory trashing
	  when one thread deletes the node and the second thread still
	  holds the reference to it over the nodecmd command.
	  Added "struct domNode *nextDeleted" to maintain the list of
	  deleted nodes, as explained above.
	
	* generic/tcldom.c: introduced changes in the way nodes are
	  deleted from the tree in multi-threading shared-tree situations.
	  We now do not delete nodes having references from nodecmds from
	  different threads/interpreters. Instead, we put them on the 
	  deleted nodes list and tear-down this list when we delete the
	  document. 

	* generic/tcldom.c: when a thread detaches from the shared dom tree
	  it will now properly delete all commands attached to nodes.
	  Also, the dom object command barks when attempting to use already
	  deleted node (the node put on the deletion list).
	
2002-11-15  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * tests/dom.test: Added some tests for as yet not covered node
          methods.

        * tests/htmlreader.test: Minor fix: added tcltest cleanup.

        * generic/tcldom.c: Changed 'attributes' method to return the
          empty string as result for non element nodes, according to
          the DOM 2 rec, chapter "Interface Node". Fixed a seg fault
          in hasAttributeNS. Closed a mem leak in appendXML.

        * lib/tdom.tcl: Added simple debugging feature to
          tDOM::extRefHandler.

2002-11-14  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	* generic/tcldom.c: fixed UMR report from Purify

2002-11-12  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * win/makefile.vc
        * extensions/tnc/makefile.vc: Updated to the new version nr
          and the lib name convention of the new TEA 2 build system.

2002-11-09  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/tcldom.c: HTML serializer: No content escaping for
          the HTML tags script and style, according to XSLT rec
          16.2. Fixed a memory problem during interp deletion.

        * generic/dom.c
        * generic/domxpath.c: Minor changes.

2002-11-03  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * lib/tdom.tcl: tDOM::xmlOpenFile fix for files < 4 Byte size.    
        
        * generic/domxpath.c
        * generic/domxpath.h: Fixed ridiculously long runtime of
          certain // expr on certain documents. During analysis and
          testing, it turned out, that it would have been an even
          simpler approach, to simply expand the abbreviation // in
          the according productions. Though, the choosen implentation
          seems often to be (slightly) faster and is a start to
          collect experiences with early predicate evaluation.

2002-11-02  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	* lib/tdomhtml.tcl: removed in favour of new tdom extension

	* extensions/tdomhtml: added new tdom extension for HTML
	  generation based on tdomhtml.tcl and internal tdom 
	  appendFromScript mechanism. This is a Tcl-only extension
	  which merely needs to be "make install"'ed.

	* Makefile.in: removed traces of tdomhtml.tcl file since it
	  now lives in its own extension

 	* configure.in:
	* configure: added TDOM_LD_SEARCH_FLAGS processing to help
	  runtime linker locate eventual custom shared libraries

2002-11-01  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * Makefile.in: Fixed 'missing separator' problem (using tab
          instead of white space).

        * lib/tdom.tcl: Updated function-available, corrected
          ridiculous typo by my (element-avaliable ->
          element-available). Somewhat fixed and updated
          element-available.

        * generic/domxpath.c
        * tests/xpath.c: Full qualified XPath function names now are
          accepted as syntactical correct expr. The function call is
          resolved to the Tcl proc
          dom::xpathFunc::<namespaceURI>::<functionLocalname>.

        * generic/dom.c
        * generic/dom.h
        * generic/domxslt.c
        * generic/nodecmd.c
        * generic/tcldom.c
        * tests/xpath.test: Fixed old problem with Combine Set XPath
          expressions and XSLT sorts on trees, in which new nodes are
          inserted after the initial parsing (doc order of result).
    
2002-10-31  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	* lib/tdom.tcl: does now "package require tdom" only,
	  instead of "package provide tdom 0.7.5".
	  The "package provide" with a correct version is
 	  done by the C-module now (which is better).
	  Some cosmetic changes as well (keep 80-columns wide!).

  	* lib/tdomhtml.tcl: renamed version of domhtml.tcl
	  Also did some simplification in html2tcl, renamed some
	  internal private functions and added namespace-wide 
	  definitions of html command names. The _2tcl procedure
	  now creates the missing elementNode commands as it
	  parses the html code, on the fly.

	* Makefile.in: changed order of loads in the pkgIndex.tcl.
	  First the C-module is loaded, followed by the tdom.tcl 
	  library file, followed by the tdomhtml.tcl library file.
 	  Thus, the tdomhtml.tcl has become the first class citizen.

	* CHANGES: added this file

2002-10-31  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/tcldom.c
        * tests/dom.test: Fixed argument check of domObj method
          documentElement. Fixed domNode method appendFromList (wrong
          list format could result in seg fault). Thanks to Oleg
          Oleinick, for reporting both problems.

        * generic/domxslt.c
        * generic/domxpath.c
        * generic/dom.c: Fixed mem leaks/possible invalid read
    
2002-10-30  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	* generic/domxslt.c: added proper cast to arguments passed to
	  FREE() macro to avoid compiler barking at us.

2002-10-30  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

        * generic/tcldom.c: Added -escapeNonASCII and -htmlEntities
          also to node_usage and domObj_usage.

        * extensions/tnc/test.tcl: Updated to use new tDOM
          features. Made more usable.    

        * apps/xslt.tcl: Updated to using domDoc xslt method,
          -escapeNonASCII for asXML and asHTML and additionally
          -htmlEntities for asHTML.

	* generic/domxslt.c: Implemented "Forwards-Compatible
          Processing" (XSLT rec 2.5), with limitations: xsl:version
          attributes on literal result elements are not
          supported. Fixed a bug in XPath func
          format-number(). XsltProcess now accepts also a
          domDoc. Improved the setting of the documentElement of the
          resultDoc.

2002-10-29  Rolf Ade  <rolf@pointsman.de>

	* generic/tcldom.c:
        * doc/domDoc.*
        * doc/domNode.*: Added -escapeNonASCII as option to the asXML
          and asHTML methods and -htmlEntities as option to the asHTML
          method. Added "xslt" method to domDoc commands.

	* generic/dom.c: Better error reporting in case of parsing
          errors in external entities.

        * doc/expat.*: Fixed a documentation bug.
  
2002-10-29 Zoran Vasiljevic <zoran@archiware.com>

	* generic/tcldom.c
	* generic/nodecmd.c
	* generic/nodecmd.h: modified "dom createNodeCmd" to accept the
        -returnNodeCmd" optional argument. All commands created
	with this option willreturn the dom object command for accessing 
	the generated node.
	
	* ChangeLog: added this file
