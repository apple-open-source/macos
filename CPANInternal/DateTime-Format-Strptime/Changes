1.3000 2010-06-26

1.0900 2009-02-22
    - Another pile-o-bugs
        - It seems that I also wasn't seeing notifications from RT
          (please don't use it, use the Gooogle project) so all the
          following are fixed:
            36672   Started failing mid May
            23313   Bug handling time zones like America/New_York
            25555   Module dies even when on_error is 'undef'
            23768   Olson timezone handling incorrect
            22450   locale test failing with bleadperl
            20487   nmake test_more fail (with patch); incorrect
                    META.yml
            12071   format_datetime uses datetime locale rather than
                    format locale
            11863   bug in DateTime::Format::Strptime 1.0601 when using %s

        - And a couple from Google:
            #8      Add DateTime::Locale to documentation
            #10     Parsing bug -- can't detect word boundry after month abbr

1.0800 2008-08-07
    - Pile-o-bugs
        - It seems that I wasn't getting notifications from Google
          when people had reported bugs, so there's a pile of fixes
          in this release. Hopefully that fixes everyone's issues.

1.0702 2007-09-19
    - YAML and POD
        - Updated the META.yml file to have the correct 'resources'
          and match the latest spec
        - Updated the docus with a 'resources' section that has the
          same information in it for readers of POD.
        - This version ONLY changes the documentation and so it not a
          required update.

1.0701 2007-09-18
    - The revised locale tests releasese
        - Many people pointed out that while this module hadn't broken
          the tests for the French locale had. This is due to a new
          source for the data in DateTime::Locale.
        - This version ONLY changes the tests and so it not a required
          update.

1.0700 Sat,  5 Nov 2005 09:44:10 +1100
    - The 'Twighlight Zone' release
        - Mike Schilli pointed out that strings without time zones
          or constructors without a time zone should be returning
          a DateTime in the floating time zone rather than UTC.
        - Jason Bodnar requested greater allowance for time zones in
          strings .. so I've now added the ability to use an Olson
          time zone identifier with %O. Note that this is a token
          specifically added to Strptime and it WILL NOT WORK with
          DateTime's strftime method.

1.0601 Wed,  1 Sep 2004 07:52:44 +1000
    - The 'February 30th' test
        - Dave Faraldo and Jonathan Lefter pointed out that one of
          the new Locale tests in t/006... will fail on the 30th
          and 31st of the month as not all months have those days.
          Patch supplied by Jonathan has been applied.
    - This is just a test fix and doesn't alter the way the module
      runs in any way. If you already got 1.06 to run then you don't
      need this.

1.0600 Sat, 28 Aug 2004 15:02:47 +1000
    - the 'RedHat' release
        - Fixed bug from RT (#7502) from dfaraldo@redhat.com
          that made validation fall over by assuming midnight
          always exists. The patch now assumes Midday exists
          (both he and I assume that DST will never start at
          midday anywhere anytime!)
    - This is a major change and you should install this release if
      you ever use any time_zone other than floating or UTC. And if
      you don't use them today, you may tomorrow - so upgrade OK?

1.0500 Wed, 18 Aug 2004 17:24:32 +1000
    - the 'Jean Forget' release
        - Adapted and applied patches from Jean Forget to allow
          day names and month names to have \W characters and to
          allow am/pm values from other locales
        - Jean's patch also included some doc patches
        - Patched the synopsis a Jean suggestion to demonstrate
          how to use the non-default error behaviors
        - Added tests for these bugs
        - Added t/more/* and the make test_more target so I can
          test every locale if I want to.
    - It's over a year since I deprecated the language parameter so
      I've now removed it. You've had a year of warnings!
    - This is a major change and you should install this release if
      you use any locale other than en.

1.0400 Sun, 10 Aug 2003 00:22:00 +1000
    - the 'locale' release
        - Applied patches from Joshua Hoblitt to move the the brand
          new DateTime::Locale rather than the old ::Language modules
        - Implemented %x, %X and %c for locale formats
        - Fixed a bug on the two digit year determinator
        - Added a test for locales known as 004locale.t
    - This is a major change and you should install this release if
      you are using DateTime >= 0.14 (the first release with Locale)

1.0302 Sat, 28 Jun 2003 09:15:21 +1000
    - the 'Broken Windows' release
        - Test 004 was failing on Windows due to the path delimiter
          being a backslash rather than a slash. This release should
          also fix Strptime for Mac users, although I've had no
          complaints from such users. (Myself being one of the only
          ones currently using Strptime AFAIK!) Thanks Ron Hill for
          the bug report.

1.0301 Wed, 25 Jun 2003 22:40:12 +1000
    - the 'Day of Year' release
        - Updated to handle the post 0.12 DateTime that now
          validates dates. Still handles old DateTime.

1.0300 Sat, 07 Jun 2003 10:40:23 +1000
    - the 'Better way to die' release
        - The above has changed by request of Dave Rolsky and Iain
          Truskett (Thanks!). We now allow each object to have its
          own behavior.
        - The default behavior has been changed to returning undef.
          This was requested by someone (tell me if it was you!) and
          made a lot of sense to me.
    - Never released to CPAN

1.0200 Wed, 28 May 2003 21:02:03 +1000
    - the 'Proclavity to croak' release
        - The docs for Time::Local talk about the 'proclavity to croak'
          which basically means the module croaks easily. So did this
          one until now.

          Until now, if you allowed a user to specify a pattern and they
          entered one that was non parsable, this module would croak
          causing your script to croak. This is a Bad Thing (tm).

          The behaviour now remains the same, however if you set
          $DateTime::Format::StrpTime::CROAK to false, methods will
          return undef rather than croaking.
          $DateTime::Format::StrpTime::errmsg will tell you what went
          wrong.

          The default is to continue to croak. This means you have to
          delibrately turn it off. Hopefully you'll change you script
          to do this at the same time you change it to check the
          return values of the methods :)

1.0103 Wed, 28 May 2003 20:10:57 +1000
    - the 'What's up Docs' release
        - Applied doc patches from Iain Truskett (Thanks!)
        - Clarified parameter discrepancy between synopsis and docs
          (Thanks Chris Winters)

1.0102 Fri, 16 May 2003 07:28:18 + 1000
    - the 'wonky test' release
        - Fixed the same test as above. Think I actually succeeded
          this time!

1.0101 Tue, 13 May 2003 07:58:23 + 1000
    - the 'oldtimers' release
        - Fixed a test that was broken if DateTime::TimeZone was not
          version 0.13 or above.

1.0100 Sun, 11 May 2003 13:54:36 + 1000
    - the 'nanozone' release
        - If we have the latest DateTime we run the test mentioned above
        - Fixed my version format as advised by Iain Truskett
          if it still doesn't work it's because of me, not him
        - Added the ability to handle nanoseconds as requested by
          Michael Goltze.
        - Got Time Zones working, including mapping non-ambiguous TLAs
          offsets and Olsen names (the latter uses the %q token)

1.00.02 Tue, 29 Apr 2003 07:03:19 + 1000
    - the 'please the testers' release
        - Fixed a test that only worked in DateTime was from CVS
        - Fixed two issues noted by Iain Truskett:
        - Removed a diag() in test 1 that was just there for
          testing the test
        - Added a linebreak to the end of the MANIFEST

1.00.01 Mon, 28 Apr 2003 07:12:01 +1000
    - the 'what the hell is that' release
        - removed alien life-forms (characters that didn't ASCIIfy)
    * No API change, just made it so it will install now!

1.00.00 Sun, 27 Apr 2003 17:56:27 +1000
    - first release version
        - first CPAN release
        - added tests
        - should be 100% compatible with DateTime's strftime function


0.01 Fri, 25 Apr 2003 21:30:21 +1000
    - original version - posted to DateTime mailing list
