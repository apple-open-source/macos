=head1 NAME

XML::LibXML::SAX - XML::LibXML direct SAX parser


=head1 DESCRIPTION

XML::LibXML provides an interface to libxml2 direct SAX interface. Through this
interface it is possible to generate SAX events directly while parsing a
document. While using the SAX parser XML::LibXML will not create a DOM Document
tree.

Such an interface is useful if very large XML documents have to be processed
and no DOM functions are required. By using this interface it is possible to
read data stored within a XML document directly into the application
datastructures without loading the document into memory.

The SAX interface of XML::LibXML is based on the famous XML::SAX interface. It
uses the generic interface as provided by XML::SAX::Base.

Additionally to the generic functions, which are only able to process entire
documents, XML::LibXML::SAX provides parse_chunk(). This method generates SAX
events from well ballanced data such as is often provided by databases.

NOTE: At the moment XML::LibXML provides only an incomplete interface to
libxml2's native SAX implementaion. The current implementation is not tested in
production environment. It may causes significant memory problems or shows
wrong behaviour. If you run into specific problems using this part of
XML::LibXML, let me know.
