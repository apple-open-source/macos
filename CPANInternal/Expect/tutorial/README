NOTE: This tutorial is completely outdated and needs a major overhaul.
I still leave it in because it provides some additional info, but
don't expect to be able to learn anything from it...


	The tutorial is in order of how I would want to learn to use this tool.
very briefly, here's an index:

	1. Introduction, how/why one would want to use this tool.
	2. Spawn, expect- how to talk to a process.
	3. Debugging.
	4. Interacting with a spawned process.
	5. Monkeying with tty settings. Good for grabbing passwords, among
other things.
	6. Miscellaneous extra functions.

	Let me know if there's something you'd like to see that isn't here.
