    - clarifying docs for &initialize (thanks jcs)
    - applying patch from Robert Norris to add 
      next::can() and maybe::next::method() 
      functionality which allows safe probing of 
      the presence of the next method

0.11 Thurs, Feb 23, 2006
    - added some more tests for edge cases
    - removed INIT, you must explicitly call &initialize now
        - added docs explaining this
        - altered tests as needed
    - moved the C3 algorithm to Algorithm::C3 and added 
      that as a dependency to this module
    - added docs to explain the "next::method in anon-sub" issue
        - suggestions/solutions/patches welcome :)
    - bumped the Scalar::Util version requirement back down
      to 1.10, apparently the newer version has some issues          

0.10 - Wed, Feb 8, 2006
    - removed the Sub::Name and NEXT dependencies and 
      made the test just skip if they are not present
    - bumped the Scalar::Util version requirement up 
      (the newest version tends to work the best across
      different platforms)

0.09 - Fri, Dec 30, 2005
    - this is actually the proper version of 0.08, I forgot
      to check in some modifications, and so they didn't get
      included in my upload. 

0.08 - Wed, Dec 28, 2005
    - adjusted &_remove_method_dispatch_table to be more 
      discriminating about what it deletes. Thanks to 
      Matt S. Trout for this fix.
    - tweaked &_merge to avoid un-needed looping. Thanks to 
      Audrey Tang for this fix.
    - added better support for calling next::method within 
      an eval BLOCKs and anon-subroutines. Thanks to Justin 
      Guenther for this patch and test.

        - added test for this

0.06 - Tues, Nov 15, 2005

    - removed OS X resource fork which slipped into the tar.gz
    - improved error reporting for Inconsistent Hierarchies
