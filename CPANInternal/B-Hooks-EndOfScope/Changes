  * Depend on Variable::Magic 0.34 so exceptions during compile time that
    trigger a destructor don't cause an exception on 5.10 anymore.

  * Depend on Variable::Magic 0.31 so exceptions thrown in on_scope_end
    blocks don't lose their error message.

  * Depend on Variable::Magic 0.27 to stop exceptions thrown in
    on_scope_end blocks from segfaulting. Also add a test for that.

  * Use Variable::Magic and cast %^H instead Scope::Guard and relying
    on a timely destruction of objects within %^H. This fixes using
    on_scope_end in blocks where string evals are compiled as those
    increment the refcount of objects in %^H on 5.10.

0.04  Mon, 20 Oct 2008 12:56:23 +0200
  * Remove an unused bit from the $^H mask.

0.03  Mon, 20 Oct 2008 06:53:20 +0200
