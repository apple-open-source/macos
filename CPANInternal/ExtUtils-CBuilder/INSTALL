           Installation instructions for ExtUtils::CBuilder

To install this module, do this:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install

Alternatively, if you don't want to use the newer Module::Build module,
you can follow the standard steps for installing most Perl modules:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Or you may use the CPAN.pm module, which will automatically execute
these steps for you.  See 'perldoc CPAN' for the details.
