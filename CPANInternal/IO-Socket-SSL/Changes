v1.76 2012.06.18
- no longer depend on Socket.pm 1.95 for inet_pton, but use Socket6.pm if 
  no current Socket.pm is available. Thanks to paul[AT]city-fan[DOT]org
  for pointing out the problem and providing first patch
v1.75 2012.06.15
- made it possible to explicitly disable TLSv11 and TLSv12 in SSL_version
v1.74_2 2012.06.07
- fixed documentation errors, reported by MARSCHAP
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=77690
v1.74_1 2012.06.07
- add support to IO::Socket::IP which support inet6 and inet4 by
  integrating patch from PEVANS
  for https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=75218
v1.74 2012.05.13
- accept a version of SSLv2/3 as SSLv23, because older documentation
  could be interpreted like this
v1.73 2012.05.11
- make test t/dhe.t hopefully work for more version of openssl
  Thanks to paul[AT]city-fan[DOT]org for providing bug reports and
  testing environment
v1.72 2012.05.10
- set DEFAULT_CIPHER_LIST to ALL:!LOW instead of HIGH:!LOW
  Thanks to dcostas[AT]gmail[DOT]com for problem report
v1.71 2012.05.09
- 1.70 done right. Also don't disable SSLv2 ciphers, SSLv2 support is better
  disabled by the default SSL_version of 'SSLv23:!SSLv2'
v1.70 2012.05.08
- make it possible to disable protols using SSL_version, make SSL_version
  default to 'SSLv23:!SSLv2'
v1.69 2012.05.08
- re-added workaround in t/dhe.t
v1.68 2012.05.07
- remove SSLv2 from default cipher list, which makes failed tests after last
  change work again, fix behvior for empty cipher list (use default)
v1.67 2012.05.07
- https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=76929
  thanks to d[DOT]thomas[AT]its[DOT]uq[DOT]edu[DOT]au for reporting
  - if no explicit cipher list is given it will now default to ALL:!LOW instead 
    of the openssl default, which usually includes weak ciphers like DES.
  - new config key SSL_honor_cipher_order and documented how to use it to fight
    BEAST attack. 
v1.66 2012.04.16
- make it thread safer, thanks to bug report from vega[DOT]james[AT]gmail
  [DOT]com, https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=76538
v1.65 2012.04.16
- added NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation) support based on patch from kmx
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=76223
v1.64 2012.04.06
- clarify some behavior regarding hostname verfication.
  Thanks to DOHERTY for reporting.
v1.63 2012.04.06
- applied patch of DOUGDUDE to ignore die from within eval to make tests 
  more stable on Win32, https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=76147
v1.62 2012.03.28
- small fix to last version
v1.61 2012.03.27
- call CTX_set_session_id_context so that servers session caching works with
  client certificates too. 
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=76053
v1.60 2012.03.20
- don't make blocking readline if socket was set nonblocking, but return as
  soon no more data are available
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=75910
- fix BUG section about threading so that it shows package as thread safe
  as long as Net::SSLeay >= 1.43 is used
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=75749
v1.59 2012.03.08
- if SSLv2 is not supported by Net::SSLeay set SSL_ERROR with useful 
  message when attempting to use it. 
- modify constant declarations so that 5.6.1 should work again
v1.58 2012.02.26
- fix t/dhe.t again to enable the workaround only for newer openssl
  versions, because this would cause failures on older versions
v1.57 2012.02.26
- fix t/dhe.t for openssl 1.0.1 beta by forcing tlsv1, so that it does
  not complain about the too small rsa key which it should not use anyway.
  Thanks to paul[AT]city-fan[DOT]org  for reporting.
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=75165
v1.56 2012.02.22
- add automatic or explicit (via SSL_hostname) SNI support, needed for
  multiple SSL hostnames with same IP. Currently only supported for the 
  client.
v1.55 2012.02.20
- work around IO::Sockets work around for systems returning EISCONN etc
  on connect retry for non-blocking sockets by clearing $! if SUPER::connect
  returned true.
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=75101
  Thanks for Manoj Kumar for reporting.
v1.54 2012.01.11
- return 0 instead of undef in SSL_verify_callback to fix unitialized
  warnings.  Thanks to d[DOT]thomas[AT]its[DOT]uq[DOT]edu[DOT]au for 
  reporting the bug and MIKEM for the fix.
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=73629
v1.53 2011.12.11
- kill child in t/memleak_bad_hanshake.t if test fails 
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=73146
  Thanks to CLEACH ofr reporting
v1.52 2011.12.07
- fix syntax error in t/memleak_bad_handshake.t
  thanks to cazzaniga[DOT]sandro[AT]gmail[DOT]com for reporting
v1.51 2011.12.06
- disable t/memleak_bad_handshake.t on AIX, because it might hang
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=72170
v1.50 2011.12.06
  Thanks to HMBRAND for reporting and Rainer Tammer tammer[AT]tammer[DOT]net for
  providing access to AIX system
v1.49 2011.10.28 
- another regression for readline fix, this time it failed to return lines
  at eof which don't end with newline. Extended t/readline.t to catch this
  case and the fix for 1.48
  Thanks to christoph[DOT]mallon[AT]gmx[DOT]de for reporting
v1.48 2011.10.26
- bugfix for readline fix in 1.45. If the pending data where false
  (like '0') it failed to read rest of line.
  Thanks to Victor Popov for reporting
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=71953
v1.47 2011.10.21
- fix for 1.46 - check for mswin32 needs to be /i. Thanks to
  Alexandr Ciornii for reporting
v1.46 2011.10.18
- disable test t/signal-readline.t on windows, because signals are
  not relevant for this platform and test does not work.
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=71699
v1.45 2011.10.12
- fix readline to continue when getting interrupt waiting for more
  data. Thanks to kgc[AT]corp[DOT]sonic[DOT]net for reporting problem
v1.44 2011.05.27
- fix invalid call to inet_pton in verify_hostname_of_cert when 
  identity should be verified as ipv6 address, because it contains
  colon.
v1.43_1 2011.05.12
- try to make t/nonblock.t more stable, especially on Mac OS X
v1.43 2011.05.11
- fix t/nonblock.t
- stability improvements t/inet6.t
v1.42 2011.05.10
- add SSL_create_ctx_callback to have a way to adjust context on
  creation. https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=67799
- describe problem of fake memory leak because of big session cache
  and how to fix it, see https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=68073
v1.41 2011.05.09
- fix issue in stop_SSL where it did not issue a shutdown of the 
  SSL connection if it first received the shutdown from the other
  side. Thanks to fencingleo[AT]gmail[DOT]com for reporting
- try to make t/nonblock.t more reliable, at least report the real
  cause of ssl connection errors
v1.40 2011.05.02
- integrated patch from GAAS to get IDN support from URI.
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=67676
v1.39_1 2011.05.02
- fix in exampel/async_https_server.
  Thanks to DetlefPilzecker[AT]web[DOT]de for reporting
v1.39 2011.03.03
- fixed documentation of http verification: wildcards in cn is allowed
v1.38_1 2011.01.24
- close should undef _SSL_fileno, because the fileno is no longer
  valid (SSL connection and socket are closed)
v1.38 2011.01.18
- fixed wildcards_in_cn setting for http (wrongly set in 1.34 to 1
  instead of anywhere). Thanks to dagolden[AT]cpan[DOT]org for
  reporting
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=64864
v1.37 2010.12.09
- don't complain about invalid certificate locations if user explicitly 
  set SSL_ca_path and SSL_ca_file to undef. Assume that user knows what
  he is doing and will work around the problems by itself.
  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=63741
v1.36 2010.12.08
- update documentation for SSL_verify_callback based on 
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=63743
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=63740
v1.35 2010.12.06
- if verify_mode is not VERIFY_NONE and the ca_file/ca_path cannot be
  verified as valid it will no longer fall back to VERIFY_NONE but throw
  an error. Thanks to Salvatore Bonaccorso and Daniel Kahn Gillmor for
  pointing out the problem, see also 
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=606058
v1.34 2010.11.01
- schema http for certificate verification changed to 
  wildcards_in_cn=1, because according to rfc2818 this is valid and
  also seen in the wild
- if upgrading socket from inet to ssl fails due to handshake problems
  the socket gets downgraded, but is still open.
  See https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=61466
- depreceate kill_socket, just use close()
v1.33 2010.03.17
- attempt to make t/memleak_bad_handshake.t more stable, it fails 
  for unknown reason on various systems
- fix hostname checking: an IP should only be checked against 
  subjectAltName GEN_IPADD, never against GEN_DNS or CN.
  Thanks to rusch[AT]genua[DOT]de for bug report
v1.32 2010.02.22
- Makefile.PL: die if Scalar::Util has no dualvar support instead of
  only complaining. Thanks to w[DOT]phillip[DOT]moore[AT]gmail[DOT]com
  for reporting.
v1.31 2009.09.25
- add and export constants for SSL_VERIFY_* 
- set SSL_use_cert if cert is given and not SSL_server
- support alternative CRL file with SSL_crl_file thanks to patch of
  w[DOT]phillip[DOT]moore[AT]gmail[DOT]com
v1.30_3 2009.09.03
- make t/memleak_bad_handshake.t more stable (increase listen queue,
  ignore errors on connect, don't run on windows..)
v1.30_2 2009.09.01
- t/memleak_bad_handshake.t don't write errors with ps to stderr,
  -o vsize argument is not supported on all platforms, just skip
  test then
v1.30_1 2009.08.31
- make sure that idn_to_ascii gets no \0 bytes from identity, because
  it simply cuts the string their (using C semantics). Not really a
  security problem because IDN like identity is provided by user in
  hostname, not by certificate.

v1.30 2009.08.19
- fix test t/memleak_bad_handshake.t
v1.29 2009.08.19
- fixed thanks for version 1.28
v1.28 2009.08.19
- fix memleak when SSL handshake failed.
  Thanks richardhundtu[AT]gmail[DOT]com

v1.27 2009.07.24
- changed possible local/utf-8 depended \w in some regex against more
  explicit [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Fixed one regex, where it assumed, that service
  names can't have '-' inside
- fixed bug https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=48131
  where eli[AT]dvns[DOT]com reported warnings when perl -w was used.
  While there made it more aware of errors in Net::ssl_write_all (return
  undef not 0 in generic_write)
v1.26 2009.07.03
- SECURITY BUGFIX! 
  fix Bug in verify_hostname_of_cert where it matched only the prefix for 
  the hostname when no wildcard was given, e.g. www.example.org matched
  against a certificate with name www.exam in it
  Thanks to MLEHMANN for reporting

v1.25 2009.07.02
- t/nonblock.t: increase number of bytes written to fix bug with OS X 10.5
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=47240

v1.24 2009.04.01
- add verify hostname scheme ftp, same as http
- renew test certificates again (root CA expired, now valid for 10 years)

v1.23 2009.02.23
- if neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path are known (e.g not given and the
  default values have no existing file|path) disable checking of
  certificates, but carp about the problem
- new test certificates, the old ones expired and caused tests to fail

v1.22 2009.01.24
- Net::SSLeay stores verify callbacks inside hash and never clears them, so
  set verify callback to NULL in destroy of context

v1.21 2009.01.22
- auto verification of name in certificate created circular reference between
  SSL and CTX object with the verify_callback, which caused the objects to be
  destroyed only at program end. Fix it be no longer access $self from inside
  the callback.
  Thanks to odenbach[AT]uni-paderborn[DOT]de for reporting

v1.20 2009.01.15
- only changes on test suite to make it ready for win32
  (tested with strawberry perl 5.8.8)

v1.19 2008.12.31
- fix verifycn_name autodetection from PeerAddr/PeerHost

v1.18 2008.11.17
- fixed typo in argument: wildcars_in_cn -> wildcards_in_cn
  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=40997
  thanks to ludwig[DOT]nussel[AT]suse[DOT]de for reporting

v1.17 2008.10.13
- no code changes, publish v.16_3 as v.17 because it looks better 
  than v.16
- document win32 behavior regarding non-blocking and timeouts

v1.16_3   2008.09.25
- fix t/nonblock.t with workaround for problems with 
  IO::Socket::INET on some systems (Mac,5.6.2) where it cannot do 
  nonblocking connect and leaves socket blocked.
- make some tests less verbose by fixing diag in t/testlib.t 
  (send output to STDOUT not STDERR and prefix with '#')

v1.16_2   2008.09.24
- work around Bug in IO::Socket::INET6 on BSD systems
  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39550
  by setting Domain based on PeerAddr
  Thanks to srezic for report and support
- remove tests of recv/send from t/core.t. Might badly interact
  with SSL handshake and cause crashes as seen on OS X 10.4

v1.16_1   2008.09.19
- better support for IPv6:
  - IPv6 is enabled by default if IO::Socket::INET6 is available
  - t/inet6.t for basic tests

v1.16    2008.09.19
- change code for SSL_check_crl to use X509_STORE_set_flags instead of
  X509_STORE_CTX_set_flags based on bug report from 
  <tjtoocool[AT]phreaker[DOT]net >
- change opened() to report -1 if the IO::Handle is open, but the
  SSL connection failed, needed with HTTP::Daemon::SSL which will send
  an error mssage over the unencrypted socket

v1.15
- change internal behavior when SSL handshake failed (like when verify
  callback returned an error) in the hope to fix spurios errors in 
  t/auto_verify_hostname.t

v1.14
- added support for verification of hostname from certificate
  including subjectAltNames, support for IDN etc based on patch and
  input from christopher[AT]odenbachs[DOT]de and 
  achim[AT]grolmsnet[DOT]de.
  It is also possible to get more information from peer_certificate
  based on this patch. See documentation for peer_certificate and
  verify_hostname
- automatic verification of hostnames with SSL_verifycn_scheme and
  SSL_verifycn_name
- global setting of default context options like SSL_verifycn_scheme,
  SSL_verify_mode with set_ctx_defaults
- fix import of inet4,inet6 which got broken within 1.13_X.
  Thanks to <at[AT]altlinux[DOT]ru> for bugreport and patch
- clarified and enhanced debugging supppport based on bugreport
  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=32960
- put information into README regarding the supported and recommanded
  version of Net::SSLeay

v1.13
- removed CLONE_SKIP which was added in 1.03 because this breaks
  windows forking. Handled threads/windows forking better by making
  sure that CTX from Net::SSLeay gets not freed multiple times from 
  different threads after cloning/forking
- removed setting LocalPort to 0 in tests, instead leave it undef
  if a random port should be allocated. This should fix build problems 
  with 5.6.1. Thanks to <andrew[DOT]benham[AT]thus[DOT]net>

v1.12
- treat timeouts of 0 for accept_SSL and connect_SSL like no timeout,
  like IO::Socket does.

v1.11
- fixed errors in accept_SSL which would work when called from start_SSL
  but not from accept

v1.10
- start_SSL, accept_SSL and connect_SSL have argument for Timeout
  so that the SSL handshake will not block forever. Only used if the
  socket is blocking. If not set the Timeout value from the underlying
  IO::Socket is used

v1.09
- new method stop_SSL as opposite of start_SSL based on a idea
  of Bron Gondwana <brong[AT]fastmail[DOT]fm>
  To support this method the SSL_shutdown handling had to be
  fixed, e.g. in close a proper unidirectional shutdown
  should be done while in stop_SSL a bidirectional shutdown
- try to make it clearer that thread support is buggy

v1.08
- make sure that Scalar::Util has support for dualvar
  (Makefile.PL,SSL.pm) because the perl-only version has
  has no dualvar

v1.07
- fix t/nonblock.t on systems which have by default a larger
  socket buffer. Set SO_SNDBUF explicitly with setsockopt
  to force smaller writes on the socket

v1.06
- instead of setting undef args to '' in configure_SSL drop
  them. This makes Net::SMTP::SSL working again because it
  does not give LocalPort of '' to IO::Socket::INET any more

v1.05
- make session cache working even if the IO::Socket::SSL object
  was not created with IO::Socket::SSL->new but with
  IO::Socket::SSL->start_SSL on an established socket

v1.04
- added way to create SSL object with predefined session
  cache, thus making it possible to share the cache between
  objects even if the rest of the context is not shared
  key SSL_session_cache
  Note that the arguments of IO::Socket::SSL::SessionCache::new
  changed (but you should never have used this class directly
  because it's internal to IO::Socket::SSL)

v1.03
- add CLONE_SKIP as proposed by 
  Jarrod Johnson jbjohnso at us dot ibm dot com

v1.02
- added some info to BUGS and to BUGS section of pod
- added TELL and BINMODE to IO::Socket::SSL::SSL_HANDLE, even
  if they do nothing useful.
- all tests allocate now the ports dynamically, so there should
  be no longer a conflict with open ports on the system where
  the tests run

v1.01
- work around Bug in Net::HTTPS where it defines sub blocking
  as {}, e.g. force scalar context when calling sub blocking
  (in IO::Socket::SSL::write)
  see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=383106

v1.0
- fix depreciated and practically undocumented function 
  get_peer_certificate so that LWP Net::HTTPS works again
- set arg 'Blocking' while calling SUPER::configure only
  if it was set by the caller to work around Problem in LWP
  Net::HTTPS

v0.999
- If SSL_cipher_list is not given it uses the openssl
  default instead of setting it to 'ALL:!LOW:!EXP' like
  before. The old value included ADH and this might be
  a bad idea, see BUGS why.

v0.998
- declare socket as opened before calling fatal_ssl_error
  because the SSL_error_trap set up from HTTP::Daemon
  needs this
- accept_SSL sets errors on $socket (the accepted socket)
  not $self (the listening socket if called from accept)
  so it can be queried from SSL_error_trap
- note in BUGS section that IO::Socket::SSL is not thread-safe

v0.997
- fix readline (e.g. getline,getlines,<>) so that it behaves
  regarding $/ like written in the $/ dokumentation.

v0.996
- removed links and comments to inofficial release of
  Net::SSLeay, because there is a newer version already

v0.995
- add support for Diffie Hellman Key Exchange.
  See parameter SSL_dh_file and SSL_dh.

v0.994
- hide DEBUG statements and remove test to load Debug.pm
  because packets like Spamassisin cannot cope with it
  (at least the OpenBSD port)

v0.993
- added SSL_cert and SSL_key parameter which do not take
  a file name like SSL_cert_file and SSL_key_file but
  an internal X509* resp. EVP_PKEY* value. Useful for
  dynamically created certificates and keys.
- added test for sysread/syswrite behavior (which was changed
  in v0.991)

v0.992
- _set_rw_error does $!||=EAGAIN only if error is one of 
  SSL_WANT_READ|SSL_WANT_WRITE (patch from Mike Smith 
  <mike at mailchannels dot com>)
- Fix Makefile.PL to allow detectection of failures in PREREQ_PM
  (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20563, patch 
  by alexchorny at gmail dot com)

v0.991
- sysread and syswrite ar no longer the same as read and write,
  but can return already if only parts of the data are read
  or written (which is the usual semantic for sysread and syswrite)
  This should fix problems with HTTP::Daemon::SSL

v0.99
- just upgrade Version number because I've screwed up upload
  of v0.98 to cpan

v0.98
- Maintainer changed to <Steffen_Ullrich at genua dot de>
- Better support for nonblocking sockets:
  . exports $SSL_ERROR which contains the latest error from
    the openssl library. Exports constants SSL_WANT_READ and
    SSL_WANT_WRITE es special errors which will be set if
    openssl wants to write or read during nonblocking connects,
    accepts, reads or writes.
  . accept,accept_SSL,connect and connect_SSL don't block
    anymore if the socket is nonblocking.
    Instead $! will be set from the underlying IO::Socket::INET
    connect or accept if it failed there (usually EAGAIN or 
    EINPROGRESS) or if the underlying openssl needs to read or
    write $! will be set to EAGAIN and $SSL_ERROR will be set
    to SSL_WANT_READ or SSL_WANT_WRITE
  . syswrite returns undef and sets $!,$SSL_ERROR if it fails 
    to write instead of returning 0.
- Bugfixes (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=Bugid)
  . Bug 18439: fileno 0 should be valid
  . Bug 15001: sysread interpretes buffer "0" as ""
- peer_certifcate returns X509 struct string if no field
  for extraction was specified 
- get_peer_certificate returns the certificate instead of the
  IO::Socket::SSL object

   
v0.97
- Writes now correctly return errors.  (Problem noted by
  Dominique Quatravaux <dom at idealx.com>).
- CA paths now work without passing an empty SSL_ca_file
  argument.  (Problem found by Phil Pennock, <phil.pennock
  at globnix.org>).
- IO::Socket::SSL now automatically passes Proto => tcp (if
  not already specified) to IO::Socket::INET to work around
  /etc/services files with udp entries listed first.  (Fix
  suggested by Phil Pennock).
- $socket->accept() now returns the peer address in array
  context for better conformance with IO::Socket::INET.
  However, if you were doing "map { $_->accept } (@sockets)",
  or similar tricks, you will need to use "scalar" to get the
  old behavior back.  (Problem noted by Nils Sowen, <n.sowen
  at kon.de>).
- IO::Socket::SSL should now properly block on reads larger
  than the buffer size of Net::SSLeay.  (Problem found by Eric
  Jergensen, <eric at dvns.com>).
- IO::Socket::SSL should now send CA Certs (if necessary)
  along with certificates.  (Problem found by <roy at
  momentous.ca>).
- Timeouts should now work, but be aware that if multiple
  reads/writes are necessary to complete a connection, then
  each one may have a separate timeout.  (Request from
  Dominique Quatravaux <dom at idealx.com>).
- In certain cases, start_SSL() would misplace a socket's
  fileno, causing problems with starting SSL.  This should now
  be fixed.  (Problem found by <russ at zerotech.net>).
- IO::Socket::SSL now requires a minimum of Net::SSLeay 1.21.

--- Old Versions --------------------------------------------------

v0.96  2004.4.30
- Makefile's error messages now correct if output is
  redirected (patch from Ilya Zakharevich <ilya at
  math.berkeley.edu>).
- Non-blocking connects/accepts now work (Problem found by
  Uri Guttman <uri at stemsystems.com>).
- new_from_fd() now works.
- getline() and <> in scalar context now return undef
  instead of '' if the read failed.  (Problem found by
  Christian Gilmore <cag at us.ibm.com>).
- Broken pipe signals are now ignored during socket close
  to prevent a SSL shutdown message from killing the parent
  program.  (Problem found by Christian Gilmore).
- Tests should proceed much more quickly, and a semi-race was
  fixed, meaning that on slow machines the tests should be
  more reliable.
- Check for Scalar::Util and Weakref now uses default
  $SIG{__DIE__} instead of a potentially user-altered one
  (suggestion from Olaf Schneider <Olaf.Schneider at
  iwr.fzk.de>).  This only applies to Perl 5.6.0 & above.
- Session caching support (patch from Marko Asplund
  <marko.asplund at kronodoc.fi>).
- set_default_context() added to alter the behavior of
  modules that use IO::Socket::SSL from the main program.
- get_ssl_object() renamed to _get_ssl_object() to reflect
  the fact that it's only supposed to be used internally
  (not that you should have cared, of course).
- Added patch for Net::SSLeay to take advantage of
  client-side session caching.

v0.95  2003.8.25
- Changed PeerAddr in example/ssl_client.pl back to localhost.
- Update of examples to automatically switch to the proper
  directory if they cannot find the necessary SSL certificates.
- Minor documentation update with more INET6 info.
- Corrected some error messages for IO::Socket::INET6.
- Better opened() behavior when sockets close unexpectedly.
- Added note about random number generators for Solaris users
  (Problem found by Christian Gilmore <cag at us.ibm.com>).
- Added support for WeakRef and Scalar::Util to allow
  IO::Socket::SSL objects to auto-destroy themselves when 
  they go out of scope.
- Added croak()ing for unimplemented send() and recv() methods
  so they are not accidentally used to transmit unencrypted
  data.  The Perl builtin functions cannot be reliably trapped
  and are still dangerous, a fact that the POD now reflects
  (Problem noted by Michal Ludvig <michal at logix.cx>).

v0.94  2003.6.26
- Changed accept() to use inherited accept() instead of
  IO::Socket::accept, so that IPv6 inheritance is possible.
- Added options to import() so that a user could specify
  IPv6 or IPv4 mode of operation.
- Documentation fixes, esp. e-mail address.

v0.93  2003.6.24
- Fixed error-checking slip in connect_SSL() (Problem found by
  Uri Guttman <uri at stemsystems.com>).
- All functions now return the empty list () on errors.
- Added note about the above change to appease Graham Barr
  <gbarr at pobox.com>.
- Fixed Net::SSLeay giving warnings when arguments are undef;
  in all cases, undef arguments may be set to '' without any
  change in behavior except for removing the warnings.
  (Problem found by Dominique Quatravaux <dom at idealx.com>)
- If accept() or connect() fails in SSL negotiation, the user
  now has the option to print something to the failed socket
  before it is closed.  (error_trap option in new())
- Added support for CRLs (SSL_check_crl option in new()) for
  versions of OpenSSL >= 0.9.7b (Original patch from
  Brian Lindauer <jbl at sysd.com>)
- Finally added decent support for certificate callbacks.
  (SSL_verify_callback option in new(), suggestion from
  Dariush Pietrzak <eyck at ghost.anime.pl>).
- accept()/connect()/socket_to_SSL() now fail immediately if
  the socket in question does not have a fileno.
- Added the kill_socket() method to guarantee that a socket dies.
- Fixed extra warning when printing errors in debug mode.
- Deprecated socket_to_SSL() in favor of the class method
  start_SSL() (Class method suggestion from Graham Barr
  <gbarr at pobox.com>).
- Added the class method start_SSL() to allow for cases when
  the desired class of the socket is not IO::Socket::SSL
  (Request from Dariush Pietrzak <eyck at ghost.anime.pl>)
- Changed socket_to_SSL to rebless socket to original class
  if SSL negotiation failed (Request from Graham Barr
  <gbarr at pobox.com>)
- Removed the daemon.pl example, as it did not work with the
  standard distribution of HTTP::Daemon (use HTTP::Daemon::SSL
  instead).

v0.92   2002.10.22
- Changed the fileno() function to support returning the fileno
  of server sockets.  (Problem found by Roland Giersig
  <RGiersig at cpan.org>).
- Fixed SSL_version incorrectly defaulting to SSLv2 (patch from
  Roland Alder <roland.alder at celeris.ch>).

v0.91   2002.08.31
- Added support for SSL_peek and SSL_pending (peek() and
  pending()).  Updated documentation, tests, etc. to reflect
  this.

v0.901  2002.08.19
- Fixed the warning that happens when sockets are not explicitly
  closed() before the program terminates.


v0.90   2002.08.13
- This version is a complete rewrite of IO::Socket::SSL.  It now
  has about half the lines of code, twice the amount of documentation,
  and a slightly more polished interface.
- IO::Socket::SSL now works properly with mod_perl and taint mode.
- Major documentation update.
- Update of the BUGS file to reflect changes made in the rewrite.
- Update of the test suite for Perl v5.8.0 (or, more precisely,
  for Scalar::Util).
- Update of the test suite for Perl v5.00503 (or, more precisely,
  for the lack of several nice features added in v5.6.0) (Marko
  Asplund <aspa at kronodoc.fi>).
- New test suite that does not need the Internet to function.
- Update of all the files in example/ to use more current features
  of IO::Socket::SSL.
- Removal of SSL_SSL and X509_Certificate classes.
- There have been a few name changes (like socketToSSL ->
  socket_to_SSL) for better consistency.
- The functionality of get_peer_certificate() and friends is deprecated.
- The functionality of want_write() and want_read() is deprecated.
- The functionality of context_init() is deprecated for normal use.
- Support for all SSL context options in the new() call.
- SSL contexts are no longer global.  The SSL_reuse_ctx option
  is provided for those who want to re-use a context.
- The default verify mode is now VERIFY_NONE.
- IO::Socket::SSL::DEBUG is now linked to Net::SSLeay::trace to
  provide different levels of debugging information.
- There is a uniform interface for error reporting, so on error
  all functions will return undef and the error will be available
  by calling errstr().
- The dump_peer_certificate() and peer_certificate() functions
  have been added.
- sysread() will now behave correctly if the offset argument is
  greater than the length of the read buffer.  It also will truncate
  the read buffer properly, according to the Perl documentation for
  sysread().
- getline(), getlines(), and getc() have been added.
- syswrite() now uses references to avoid copying large	amounts of data.
- readline() uses ssl_read_all in array context for improved speed.
- close() now uses SSL_shutdown() to properly close an SSL connection,
  unless you tell it not to.
- If you have Net::SSLeay version 1.18 or greater, X509 certificates
  will be properly freed.
- All other known bugs have been fixed.

  <koehler at securecomputing.com>.
- enable selecting SSL version for connections. patch from
  Takanori Ugai <ugai at jp.fujitsu.com>.
