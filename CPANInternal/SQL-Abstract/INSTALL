INSTALL - how to install SQL::Abstract

=head1 DESCRIPTION

To install in your root Perl tree:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you want to relocate it elsewhere, say for testing, you need
to change the C<MakeMaker PREFIX> variable:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/lib

Note: This is true for CPAN modules and is not specific to C<SQL::Abstract>.
