      { -desc => \['colA LIKE ?', 'somestring'] }

revision 1.55  2009-05-17 22:54 (UTC)
----------------------------
    - make sure that sql generation does not mutate the supplied
      where condition structure

revision 1.54  2009-05-07 17:23 (UTC)
----------------------------
    - allow special_operators to take both code refs and method names

    - make sure hash keys are sorted in all search sub-conditions
    - switch installer from EU::MM to M::I

----------------------------
    - allow -between to handle [\"", \""] and \["", @bind] 
    - allow order_by to handle -asc|desc => [qw/colA colB/] (artifact from DBIx::Class)
    - more tests and clearing up of some corner cases
    - t/10test.t does not run by default (developer only, too cpu intensive)

----------------------------
revision 1.51  2009-03-28 10:00 (UTC)
    - fixed behavior of [-and => ... ] depending on the current
      condition scope. This introduces backwards comp with 1.24

----------------------------
revision 1.50  2009-03-10 12:30 (UTC)
    - fixed the problem with values() not behaving the same as the rest of the code (RT#43483)
    - fixed interjecting arrayrefref into a where clause
    - added value-only insert test with a literal SQL snippet
    - cleanup and enhancement of t/03values.t
    - better handling of borked SQL in tests
    - deal properly with parentheses in is_same_sql_bind()
    - fixed test subs (is_same_*) in SQL::Abstract::Test to return the correct test value
    - do not version MANIFEST

    Version 1.50 was a major internal refactoring of SQL::Abstract.
    Great care has been taken to preserve the published behavior
    documented in previous versions in the 1.* family; however,
    some features that were previously undocumented, or behaved.
    differently from the documentation, had to be changed in order
    to clarify the semantics. Hence, client code that was relying
    on some dark areas of SQL::Abstract v1.* might behave differently
    in v1.50.

----------------------------
revision 1.49_04  2009-03-03
    - add support for a [\%column_meta => value] bind value format

----------------------------
revision 1.49_03  2009-02-17
    - clarify syntax of \['...', @bind] when used with a bindtype
      of 'columns'

----------------------------
revision 1.49_02  2009-02-16
    - added an AST-aware SQL::Abstract::Test library for sql syntax tests
    - vastly expanded test coverage
    - support for the { operator => \'...'|\['...', @bind] } syntax
      allowing to embed arbitrary operators on the LHS
    - fixed multiple regressions wrt DBIx::Class

----------------------------
revision 1.49_01  2009-02-11
    - support for literal SQL through the [$sql, bind] syntax.
    - added -nest1, -nest2 or -nest_1, -nest_2, ...
    - optional support for array datatypes
    - defensive programming : check arguments to functions/methods
    - fixed bug with global logic of -and/-or (no side-effects any more)
    - changed logic for distributing an op over arrayrefs
    - fixed semantics of  _bindtype on array args
    - dropped the _anoncopy of the %where tree. No longer necessary.
    - dropped the _modlogic function
    - Make col => [] and col => {$op => [] } DTRT or die instead of generating
      broken SQL. Added tests for this.
    - Added { -desc => 'column' } order by support
    - Tiny "$_"-related fix for { -desc => 'columns'} order by support
      tests + docs
