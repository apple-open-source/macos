  actual code of the sub as a string.
  Contributed by: Florian Ragwitz

[Changes for 0.96 (JSON::Syck 0.26) - 2007-08-08]

* The always-quote rule now applies to all implicit booleans

* "Yes" and "no" (including all upper/lower case forms) are now
  always dumped in quoted form to avoid ambiguities when loaded
  by loaders with ImplicitTyping set to true.
  Reported by: Malcolm Studd

* lib/YAML/Syck.pod is merged back into lib/YAML/Syck.pm.

  Contributed by: Ingy döt Net

[Changes for 0.90 (JSON::Syck 0.26) - 2007-06-22]

* Regexes are now dump/loaded correctly with modifiers, with a new
  representation: "--- !!perl/regexp:main (?i-xsm:1)", instead of the
  old mapping with a REGEXP key.  The old form still loads correctly;
  the new form corresponds to YAML.pm 0.63 and later.
  Requested by: Ingy döt Net

* Loading regexes with modifiers no longer involves an eval"" call.

[Changes for 0.88 (JSON::Syck 0.26) - 2007-06-17]

  handles properly instead of silently ignores it.
  Contributed by: Adriano Ferreira

  blessed once.  Note that loading Regexp values dumped by YAML.pm
  currently discards modifiers.

[Changes for 0.85 (JSON::Syck 0.24) - 2007-04-20]

* Strings containing both single quotes and newlines were incorrectly 
  quoted with backslash-escaped single quotes.  This is a regression
  introduced in YAML::Syck 0.84.
  Reported by: Agent Zhang

[Changes for 0.84 (JSON::Syck 0.23) - 2007-04-02]

* New $YAML::Syck::SingleQuote flag: When it is set to true, Dump will
  always emit quotes instead of bare strings.
  Requested by: Ingo Bax

* When $JSON::Syck::SingleQuote is set to true, special characters such as
  \r\n are still escaped as usual, because JavaScript allows the same form
  of escaping in strings with either quotes.
  Reported by: Dobrica Pavlinusic

[Changes for 0.83 (JSON::Syck 0.22) - 2007-02-05]

* Under JSON::Syck, as well as YAML::Syck when $ImplicitTyping is set to

  (except for the bundled libsyck code) are now under the permissive
  "MIT" license.  See the COPYRIGHT section in README for the new terms.

* Load("!! []") no longer segfaults due to empty tag names.

* Load("!!Foo []") now blesses into "Foo", not "Foo::\0".

  blessed references work: See http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PerlTagScheme
  for the new specification.
