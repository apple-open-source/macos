          - Deal with the distinct => 1 attribute properly when using
            prefetch

          which in turn returns a single count value

          implementation would overspecify the WHERE condition, reporting
          no related objects when there in fact is one
        - SQL::Translator::Parser::DBIx::Class now attaches tables to the
          central schema object in relationship dependency order

          side of the relation, to avoid duplicates
        - DBIC now properly handles empty inserts (invoking all default
          values from the DB, normally via INSERT INTO tbl DEFAULT VALUES
        - Fix find_or_new/create to stop returning random rows when
          default value insert is requested (RT#28875)
        - Make IC::DT extra warning state the column name too
        - It is now possible to transparrently search() on columns
          requiring DBI bind (i.e. PostgreSQL BLOB)

0.08103 2009-05-26 19:50:00 (UTC)
        - Multiple $resultset -> count/update/delete fixes. Now any
          of these operations will succeed, regardless of the complexity
          of $resultset. distinct, group_by, join, prefetch are all
          supported with expected results

          via GROUP BY
        - Removed interpolation of bind vars for as_query - placeholders

          merged in the correct order
        - Refactor DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Sybase to automatically
          load a subclass, namely Microsoft_SQL_Server.pm

          improved trace output, other bug fixes/cleanups
        - distinct => 1 with prefetch now groups by all columns

        - Putting IC::DateTime locale, timezone or floating_tz_ok attributes into

          directly into the columns definition
        - Switched MI code to MRO::Compat
        - Document db-side default_value caveats
        - Search_like() now warns to indicate deprecation in 0.09.

0.08099_07 2009-02-27 02:00:00 (UTC)
        - multi-create using find_or_create rather than _related for post-insert
        - fix get_inflated_columns to check has_column_loaded
        - Add DBIC_MULTICREATE_DEBUG env var (undocumented, quasi-internal)
        - Fix up multi-create to:
          - correctly propagate columns loaded during multi-insert of rels
          - not try and insert things tagged on via new_related unless required
        - Possible to set locale in IC::DateTime extra => {} config
        - Calling the accessor of a belongs_to when the foreign_key
          was NULL and the row was not stored would unexpectedly fail
        - Split sql statements for deploy only if SQLT::Producer returned a scalar
          containing all statements to be executed
        - Add as_query() for ResultSet and ResultSetColumn. This makes subqueries
          possible. See the Cookbook for details.
        - Massive rewrite of Ordered to properly handle position constraints and
          to make it more matpath-friendly
        - deploy_statements called ddl_filename with the $version and $dir arguments
          in the wrong order.
        - columns/+columns attributes now support { as => select } hahsrefs
        - support for views both in DBIC and via deploy() in SQLT

0.08099_06 2009-01-23 07:30:00 (UTC)

          This will prevent DBIC from querying the database if one or more of
          the key columns IS NULL
        - for 'belongs_to' rels, 'undef_on_null_fk' defaults to true.
        - fixed scope unaware last_insert_id fetching for MSSQL
          (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190315.aspx)
        - an sqlt_deploy_hook can now be shared between result sources using
