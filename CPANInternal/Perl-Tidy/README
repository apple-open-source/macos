Welcome to Perltidy!
    Perltidy is a tool to indent and reformat perl scripts. It can also
    write scripts in html format.

    Perltidy is free software released under the GNU General Public License
    -- please see the included file "COPYING" for details.

PREREQUISITES
    An effort has been made to keep "perltidy" compatable with versions of
    Perl as old as 5.004. This release was tested on Perl version
    5.004_04 under linux. (You can find your version with "perl -v").
    However, some systems this old may have problems with installation
    scripts.  If you run into installation difficulties, don't give up,
    try the alternative installation method described in the INSTALL file.

    The following modules are not required, but perltidy may use them if
    detected:

      HTML::Entities  will be used to encode HTML entities if detected
      Pod::Html will be used to format pod text

    The total disk space needed after removing the installation directory
    will about 2 Mb.

DOWNLOAD
    There are two source distribution files:

    *   A .tgz "tarball", with Unix-style <lf> line endings, and

    *   A zip file, .zip, with Windows-style <cr><lf> line endings.

    In addition, the web site has links to debian and RPM packages.

INSTALLATION
    For most standard installations, the standard Makefile.PL method should
    work:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     make install

    The INSTALL file has additional installation notes, and tells how to use
    perltidy without doing an installation.

WHAT NEXT
    Please see the CHANGES file for notices of any recent updates.

    Please see the BUGS file for a list of all known open bugs.

    Documentation can be found in the docs directory, and it can also be
    found at http://perltidy.sourceforge.net

    Reading the brief tutorial should help you use perltidy effectively.

    Perltidy is still being developed, so please check sourceforge
    occasionally for updates. New releases are announced on freshmeat.net.

    Bug reports, comments and suggestions are welcome. Attach the smallest
    piece of code which demonstrates the bug or issue. Your efforts are
