Installation Instructions

The instructions are basically as per any Perl module.


INSTALLING AUTOMATICALLY
------------------------

The easiest way to install is via CPAN or CPANPLUS:

CPAN:

    % perl -MCPAN -e shell                    [as root]
    > install DateTime::Format::Builder
    > quit

CPANPLUS:

    % cpanp
    > i DateTime::Format::Builder
    > q

See your local 'perldoc CPAN' or 'perldoc CPANPLUS' for
instructions on setting up and configuring CPAN or CPANPLUS.


OBTAINING THE MODULE
--------------------

The latest release version of DateTime::Format::Builder can be downloaded
from any CPAN site:

    http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/S/SP/SPOON/
    http://search.cpan.org/dist/DateTime-Format-Builder/

Interim and development versions may also be available
from the author's web site:

    http://dellah.org/perl/

DateTime::Format::Builder is distributed as a gzipped tar archive file:

    DateTime-Format-Builder-<version>.tar.gz

where <version> represents the current version number, e.g. 0.78.

To install the module, unpack the distribution archive to
create an installation directory.  Something like this:

    tar zxf DateTime-Format-Builder-0.78.tar.gz
or
    gunzip DateTime-Format-Builder-0.78.tar.gz
    tar xf DateTime-Format-Builder-0.78.tar

You can then 'cd' into the directory created,

    cd DateTime-Format-Builder-0.78



INSTALLING MANUALLY
-------------------

First, verify the package's integrity by ensuring you have
Module::Signature installed, then type:

    % cpansign -v

That will check each file's integrity, as well as the signature's
validity, thus verifying the integrity of the entire package.
If "==> Signature verified OK! <==" is not displayed, the
distribution may already have been compromised, and you should not run
its Makefile.PL.

Ideally, you should confirm with a third party that the finger print and
key id by which the signature was signed is indeed the key it is meant
to be (ideally you'll have an appropriate web of trust set up, but
that's not always possible).

The 'make install' (done later) will install the modules and scripts on
your system. You may need administrator privileges to perform this task.
Alternately you can install the module to a local directory (see
ExtUtils::MakeMaker for full details), e.g.

    % perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/abw/

Don't forget to update your PERL5LIB environment variable if you do
this, or add a line to your script to tell Perl where to find the files,
e.g.

    use lib qw( /home/abw/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0 );

If you're not after a custom location, just do:

    % perl Makefile.PL

If you are lacking any of the prerequisite modules, running that
program will tell you. All prerequisites are available from CPAN.

When you have them all:

    % make && make test

If there are any failures, it's best if you contact me. It may help
other people who have the same problem.  I don't tend to read the Perl
newsgroups or PerlMonks, so it's no use posting there.

When you report your trouble, be sure to send me the following
information;
    + result of `perl -V'
    + output from 'make test' - ideally do 'make test TEST_VERBOSE=1 >& errs'

Send those to bug-DateTime-Format-Builder@rt.cpan.org and I'll get
back to you as soon as I'm able.

If it worked, then become root and type:

    # make install

Congratulations. You've just installed DateTime::Format::Builder.

If you have a copy of cpantest installed, type:

    % cpantest -g pass -nc -p `basename \`pwd\`` -auto

Or:
    % cpantest -g pass -nc -p DateTime-Format-Builder-0.78 -auto

That will tell both me and other potential users that the module
built correctly on your machine.
