Changes for Perl extension DBD-SQLite

1.29 Fri  8 Jan 2010
    - Updated to SQLite 3.6.22 (DUNCAND)

1.28_02 Sun  3 Jan 2010
    - Now empty (or comment only) statements won't cause segv
      or "not an error" errors. Spotted by TOKUHIROM. (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #52573: previous fix always turned on the AutoCommit
      flag; it goes along with the behavior of the internal library
      but broke compat. (ISHIGAKI)
    - Removed the SQLITE_CORE and SQLITE_PRT_SZ flags at the recommendation
      of the SQLite mailing list. (ADAMK)

1.28_01 Tue 22 Dec 2009
    - Updated to SQLite 3.6.21 (ISHIGAKI)
    - silence warnings on HP-UX (HMBRAND)
    - Resolved #52573: Manual Transaction handling seems to be
      broken (hopefully) (ISHIGAKI)

1.27 Mon 23 Nov 2009
    - Switching to a production version

1.26_07 Sun 15 Nov 2009
    *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
    - Foreign keys support is once again disabled by default.
      It seems to have a greater impact than we expected and
      it actually broke things. This feature probably will be
      enabled by default by the sqlite team in the future, and
      eventually you'll need to cope with it, but right now we
      agreed with some discussion to give you more time to be
      prepared. If you use referential stuff in your schema
      (which sqlite ignores now) should do extensive testing
      to ensure that they will work when you issue "PRAGMA
      foreign_keys = ON". (ISHIGAKI)

    - Updated to SQLite 3.6.20 (DUNCAND)
    - Resolved #50935: there remained old "unicode" attribute usage
      in the pod, spotted by ASHLEY. (ISHIGAKI)

1.26_06 Wed 28 Oct 2009
    *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
    - Removed undocumented (and most probably unused) reset method
      from a statement handle (which was only accessible via func().)
      Simply use "$sth->finish" instead. (ISHIGAKI)
    - Now DBD::SQLite supports foreign key constraints by default.
      Long-ignored foreign keys (typically written for other DB
      engines) will start working. If you don't want this feature,
      issue a pragma to disable foreign keys. (ISHIGAKI)
    - Renamed "unicode" attribute to "sqlite_unicode" for integrity.
      Old "unicode" attribute is still accessible but will be
      deprecated in the near future. (ISHIGAKI)

    - You can see file/line info while tracing even if you compile
      with a non-gcc compiler. (ISHIGAKI)
    - Major code refactoring. (ISHIGAKI)
    - Pod reorganized, and some of the missing bits (including
      pragma) are added. (ISHIGAKI)

1.26_05 Thu 15 Oct 2009
    - Updated to SQLite 3.6.19 (ISHIGAKI)

1.26_04 Tue 6 Oct 2009
    *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
    - Resolved #49716: Fixed $dbh->column_info to work according to
      the spec in DBI and added support for attached databases. (VLYON)
    - Fixed $sth->primary_key_info to work according to the spec in DBI
      and changed the tests in t/27_metadata.t to reflect this. (VLYON)
    - Tweaked not to hide a real error by a "not an error" issued
      by another sqlite3 function between the failed sqlite3 function
      and the sqlite_error to report. Note that this change makes
      some failures issue two relevant errors at a time. (ISHIGAKI)

    - Updated to SQLite 3.6.18 (DUNCAND)
    - Resolved #48393: previous effort was not enough; BegunWork
      should also be handled properly (ISHIGAKI)
    - Replaced last DBILOGFP with DBIc_LOGPIO(imp_xxh) (ISHIGAKI)
    - Tweaked t/08_busy.t not to fail just because it is tested
      under a very, very slow (virtual) machine. (ISHIGAKI)
    - Added a code to look for a compiler from Module::Install::Can.
      (ISHIGAKI)
    - Added documentation and an 'Escape' attribute for $sth->table_info.
      (VLYON)

1.26_03 Wed 12 Aug 2009
    - Updated to SQLite 3.6.17 (ISHIGAKI)
    - Switched to use :memory: for most of the tests (ISHIGAKI)
    - Fixed a memory leak when prepare should fail (ISHIGAKI)
    - Added support for commit/rollback/update hooks (DAMI)
    - Added support for set_authorizer (DAMI)
    - Added support for collation_needed(), and reorganised driver API
      for user-defined collations (DAMI)
    - Exported constants from sqlite3.h into DBD::SQLite namespace (DAMI)
    - Added support in t/lib/Test.pm for checking both versions of
      driver-private methods ("func" / "sqlite_*") (DAMI)
    - Removed unused and obsolete "list_tables" from SQLite.xs (DAMI)
    - Added a default implementation for the REGEXP infix operator (DAMI)
    - Renamed several internal sqlite3_ functions to sqlite_
      for clarity (ISHIGAKI)
    - Accept empty filename at connect (sqlite will open a tempfile) (DAMI)
    - Documented the connect() method (DAMI)
    - Replaced imp_dbh->in_tran with sqlite3_get_autocommit(), hoping
      this would fix the annoying rollback issues, including #48393
      (ISHIGAKI)
    - META.yml requires is now generated instead of being derived from the
      (incorrect) PREREQ_PM values by ExtUtils::MakeMaker (ADAMK)

1.26_02 Fri 19 Jun 2009
    *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***

      work with attached databases (VLYON/ISHIGAKI)

    - Updated to SQLite 3.6.15 (DUNCAND)

      (ISHIGAKI)
    - Added access to Online Backup functionality. (TJC)
    - Added enable_load_extension pod (ISHIGAKI)
    - Now private methods/functions return true after successful
      calls (#44871) (ISHIGAKI)
    - Removed all of the "croak"s (#44871) (ISHIGAKI)

1.26_01 Tue  5 May 2009
    - Added ORDINAL_POSITION support for $dbh->column_info (ADAMK)
    - Applied several fixes from GFUJI to clean up code (#45578)
      (ISHIGAKI)
    - Skipped some of the unicode path tests under cygwin (#45166)
      (JDHEDDEN)

      value (ISHIGAKI)

1.25 Thu 23 Apr 2009
    - Amalgamation conversion turned out to be quicker than expected.
    - Changing to a production release.  (ADAMK)

1.24_02 Wed 22 Apr 2009
    - Merging various externally-contributed annotations from

    - Switching to the RT queue instead of the RT report page that
      does nothing and just refers you to email (ADAMK)

    - Adding a version for the Win32.pm dependency (ADAMK)

1.22_07 Thu 16 Apr 2009
    - Improved non-latin unicode filename support/test
      on Windows (SZABGAB/ISHIGAKI)
    - Removed the table name generator from t/lib.pl,
      getting us closer to removing t/lib.pl entirely (ADAMK)
    - Increased use of Test::NoWarnings (ADAMK)
    - Converted half the remaining lib.pl tests to t::lib::Test (ADAMK)
    - Require Win32.pm on Windows (CHORNY)

1.22_04 Sat 11 Apr 2009 
    - Adding support parsing attributes out of the DSN (ADAMK)
    - Inserted pTHX_/aTHX_ for better efficiency (suggested in #44884 by TIMB) (ISHIGAKI)
    - Dropping support for uncode before 5.8.5 to simplify support and
      to prevent people hurting themselves on platforms that don't
      properly support Unicode anyway (ADAMK)
    - Stopped guessing if a bind param looks like a number or not
      (suggested by GUIDO). This reopens #29058 and #29629, but
      there are two workarounds for them. 1) Use "bind_param"
      explicitly (rather than plain "execute", as you do for BLOB).
      2) Add "+0" to the appropriate part(s) of your SQL to let
      sqlite convert them into a number. (ISHIGAKI)

1.22_02 Wed  9 Apr 2009
    - Added missing documentation bits for 'create_collation'
      and 'progress_handler' (DAMI)
    - Resolved RT#25924 (Arguments to user-defined functions do not
      respect unicode setting) (DAMI)
    - Added comments on the return values on error, and fixed another
      wrong return value in execute (ISHIGAKI)
    - Added SQL_NULLABLE_UNKNOWN; still wonders if the error above
      should be ignored or not (ISHIGAKI)

1.22_01 Wed  9 Apr 2009
    - Resolved #25371: Calls sv_utf8_upgrade on strings going into
       the database to make sure latin-1 strings are not saved as
       Malformed UTF-8 character in the SQLite TEXT column (MIYAGAWA)

1.21 Wed  9 Apr 2009
    - Fixed the issue that execute on inactive handles returned
      0 instead of undef, which made a DBIC test broken (ISHIGAKI)

    - Resolved #34828: Please add support for user-defined collations (ADAMK)
    - Made Test::NoWarnings an optional module (CORION)

1.19_09 Sun  5 Apr 2009

    - Resolved #44779: [t/03insert.t] last_insert_id returns undef where 4
      is expected (DUNCAND, CHORNY; that is, DUNCAND debugged and solved
      the ticket based on _08, which was a flaw in the Makefile.PL
      involving an always-applied -Dno_last_insert_id, but it turns out
      CHORNY had inadvertantly applied the fix in the name of DBI cleaning)
    - Starting to use Test::NoWarnings in the test scripts (ADAMK)

    - Resolved #29058: don't quote a bind param (as a text) if it
      looks like a number (ISHIGAKI)
    - Resolved #27553: prepare_cached and analyze issue (actually
      this has been fixed before) (ISHIGAKI)

1.19_08 Sat  4 Apr 2009
    - Bumped minimum DBI dependency to 1.43 so last_insert_id is supported

      (and hopefully Mac OSX). (TOKUHIROM)
    - Fixed yet another segv while testing DBIC reconnection (DMAKI)
    - Switched from Test.pm to Test::More (though there're still
      some tests that don't use Test::More) (ISHIGAKI)
    - Added "use strict" to some. (ISHIGAKI)

      with re-using statements
    - Fix bug with overflowing integers in user defined functions
    - Fix bug when building under no-threads perl

1.13
	- A number of bug fixes from RT.
	- Support named bind parameters

1.12
	- Brought up to date with SQLite 3.3.5

1.11
    - Make blobs work transparently (without SQLBLOB binding)

1.10
    - Fix Unicode support (DOMQ)
    - Support usleep on all Linux (inc. debian) (DOMQ)
    - Upgrade to sqlite 3.2.7
    - Document how to use BLOBS

1.09
    - Support external SQLite library (rjray)
    - Don't convert things that look like numbers to numbers unless
      specifically requested.
    - Upgrade to sqlite 3.2.2

1.08
    - Support 64 bit integers (uses floating point numbers when perl is not 
        compiled with 64 bit int support). This also fixes issues with using
        sqlite timestamps.
    - Upgrade to sqlite 3.1.3
    - Fix issues of not finding rows when providing a number that perl sees as
        a string.
    - Fixes for most current bugs in RT (see http://rt.cpan.org/ to check if your

1.07
    - Fix for a memory leak (spotted by Joel Noble)
    - Update to sqlite 3.0.8 (fixes bug on Solaris-sparc)

1.06
    - Resolve symbol conflicts on mac os x.
    - Fix define in WriteMakefile lacking space.
    - Fix DBI prereq in Makefile.PL
    - Update to sqlite 3.0.7

1.05
    - Enabled HAVE_USLEEP where available which should massively
      improve concurrent usage of DBD::SQLite
    - Update to sqlite 3.0.6

1.04
    - Patched to make it compile on Windows (Steve Hay)
    - Fetch next row at end of DBI's fetch() so that one-row
      selects don't need to call ->finish(). This restores DBD::SQLite
      0.31's behaviour (and should make popfile work again)
    - last_insert_id will only work on DBI 1.43, so enforce that
    - Use snprintf from sqlite library to improve portability

1.03
    - Update to sqlite 3.0.4
    - More bug fixes
    - Don't hang forever when db is BUSY
    - Make trace macro work where vararg macros don't

    - Updated to sqlite 2.8.7
    - A number of bugs fixed

0.28

    - Aliases for perl_call_*
    - Updated to sqlite 2.8.6
    - use sqlite_freemem everywhere

0.27
    - Changed API to use sqlite streaming API. This makes things slightly
      slower for large result sets, at the benefit of being more "sane"
      internally.

0.26
    - Update to sqlite 2.8.5
    - Automatic binary encoding added (via a flag)
