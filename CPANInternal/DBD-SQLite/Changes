Revision history for Perl extension DBD::SQLite.

1.12
	- Brought up to date with SQLite 3.3.5

1.11
    - Make blobs work transparently (without SQLBLOB binding)

1.10
    - Fix Unicode support (DOMQ)
    - Support usleep on all Linux (inc. debian) (DOMQ)
    - Upgrade to sqlite 3.2.7
    - Document how to use BLOBS

1.09
    - Support external SQLite library (rjray)
    - Don't convert things that look like numbers to numbers unless
      specifically requested.
    - Upgrade to sqlite 3.2.2

1.08
    - Support 64 bit integers (uses floating point numbers when perl is not 
        compiled with 64 bit int support). This also fixes issues with using
        sqlite timestamps.
    - Upgrade to sqlite 3.1.3
    - Fix issues of not finding rows when providing a number that perl sees as
        a string.
    - Fixes for most current bugs in RT (see http://rt.cpan.org/ to check if your
      favourite bug got fixed).
    
1.07
    - Fix for a memory leak (spotted by Joel Noble)
    - Update to sqlite 3.0.8 (fixes bug on Solaris-sparc)

1.06
    - Resolve symbol conflicts on mac os x.
    - Fix define in WriteMakefile lacking space.
    - Fix DBI prereq in Makefile.PL
    - Update to sqlite 3.0.7

1.05
    - Enabled HAVE_USLEEP where available which should massively
      improve concurrent usage of DBD::SQLite
    - Update to sqlite 3.0.6

1.04
    - Patched to make it compile on Windows (Steve Hay)
    - Fetch next row at end of DBI's fetch() so that one-row
      selects don't need to call ->finish(). This restores DBD::SQLite
      0.31's behaviour (and should make popfile work again)
    - last_insert_id will only work on DBI 1.43, so enforce that
    - Use snprintf from sqlite library to improve portability

1.03
    - Update to sqlite 3.0.4
    - More bug fixes
    - Don't hang forever when db is BUSY
    - Make trace macro work where vararg macros don't

    - Implement get_info

1.00
    - Port to sqlite3 API
    - Support bind types SQL_BLOB, SQL_NUMBER, SQL_TEXT etc
    - Support $dbh->last_insert_id()
    - Added timeout API

0.31
    - Fixed a free() bug on Win32
    - Silence warnings in test suite
    - Updated to sqlite 2.8.12

0.30
    - Updated to sqlite 2.8.11

    - Aliases for perl_call_*
    - Updated to sqlite 2.8.6
    - use sqlite_freemem everywhere

0.27

      slower for large result sets, at the benefit of being more "sane"
      internally.

0.26
    - Update to sqlite 2.8.5
    - Automatic binary encoding added (via a flag)
    - Better getsqlite.pl - now deals with new files
    - Extension functions and aggregates can be created in
      perl space now.

0.25
    - Fixed Makefile.PL to no longer try creating a .c file to determine
      the OS ptrsize - use Config.pm directly in the DEFINE
    - Major updates from Tim Bunce to bring DBD::SQLite in line with
      the DBI spec and other drivers, including:
      - Support for table_info_all() and primary_key_info()
      - $sth->{NAME} updates
      - execute() returns number of rows updated
      - $dbh->{sqlite_version} returns the SQLite version in use
      - $dbh->{sqlite_encoding} returns the SQLite encoding in use
      - Improved trace debugging
      - Improved error handling
      (many MANY thanks to Tim for all these patches!)
    - Updated to sqlite 2.8.0

0.24

      different endian architectures.

      SQL, which should improve locking problems.

0.10
    - Fixed missing SQLiteXS.h from 0.09

0.09
    - Updated to SQLite 2.3.3, and some file cleanups to make that easier
      next time.
