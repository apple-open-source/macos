QUICK START GUIDE:

    perl-ldap uses the following modules/distributions.

	Convert::ASN1    - required
	URI::ldap        - optional, needed for URL parsing
	Authen::SASL     - optional, needed for SASL authentication
	Digest::MD5      - optional, needed for SASL DIGEST-MD5 auth
	IO::Socket::SSL  - optional, needed for Net::LDAPS
	XML::SAX::Writer - optional, needed for Net::LDAP::DSML
	MIME::Base64     - optional, needed for Net::LDAP::LDIF

    First ensure the above modules/distributions are installed then
    build/test/install Net::LDAP by doing

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

    Several modules in the distribution contain documentation. Once installed
    you can use the 'perldoc Net::LDAP' command to obtain the documentation.
    This documentation will contain pointers to the other modules.
