Although the Net::LDAP module was originally written by Graham Barr it
has grown far beyond initial expectations and scope. In fact it has gone
far beyond a lot of things.

As Net::LDAP has grown into the perl-ldap distribution credit can no
longer be given to any single individual, but instead belongs to a
group of people who have contributed. Some more than others, but whos
counting :)

are some of the people who have contributed, either in code, documentaion
or just ideas/feedback. If I have missed anyone, please let me know.
