0.18  Sat Feb 25 08:55:48 CET 2006
	- each_arrayref (XS) couldn't deal with refs to list literals

	   in comp.lang.perl.misc)

0.17  Wed Dec  7 10:45:43 CET 2005

	  (patch by Anno Siegel <siegel AT zrz DOT tu-berlin DOT de>)

0.16  Mon Nov 14 09:57:28 CET 2005
	- a dangling semicolon in some macros prevented
	  the XS portion to compile on some compilers
	  (Lars Thegler <lars AT thegler DOT dk>)

0.15  Fri Nov 11 09:23:29 CET 2005
	- 0.13 and 0.14 broke the module on 5.6.x

	  which had to be backported to 5.005_x

0.14  Thu Nov 10 13:08:03 CET 2005
	- 0.13 fixed the leaks but rendered the XS part uncompilable

0.13  Wed Nov  9 16:29:02 CET 2005

0.08  Fri Dec  3 17:11:14 CET 2004
	- uniq() was not mentioned in the perldocs and only had
	  the XS implementation
	- uniq() also produced wrong results on 5.8.0
	  (thanks to Slaven Rezic for spotting it and suggesting
	  a workaround)
	- the test-suite triggered a bug in 5.6.x perls
	- the test-suite now tests both the XS- and Perl-implementation
