          added Sub::Exporter::Cookbook

0.974     2007-04-22
          fix a bug: would try to export routines that didn't exist
          in the exporting package; this caused Sub::Install to give the

0.973     2007-02-02
          document changes made in 0.972
          minor code changes for readability

0.972     2006-12-05
          allow exporter config to provide name (via string ref) of generator
          for groups and exports
          similarly allow a string ref for a method name for a collector hook
          remove some pointless conditions

0.971     2006-11-06
          minor documentation clarification
          add Perl::Critic tests (disabled by default)

0.970     2006-06-27
          defaults populate before collectors collect, now
          default group's value is undef by default, not 1
          mixin_exporter can now export into objects, creating virtual classes
          
0.966     2006-06-17
          correct documentation of collector hook args
          simplify internal use of setup_exporter
          clean up documentation in ::Util

0.965     2006-06-05
          curry_class now allows the export to curry a differently-named method

          Data::OptList is now in its own dist; updated to use it

0.960     2006-05-31
          added into and into_config to config
          100% test coverage... almost!

0.954     2006-05-11
          tweaks to Data::OptList, moving toward its own dist: now it exports
          expand_opt_list is now opt_list_as_hash

0.953     2006-05-10
          require Params::Util for craftier opt list validation
          use reinstall, rather than install, to avoid warnings on redef

          add missing file to manifest

0.951     2006-04-30
          fix util-mixin.t to skip if prereqs are missing

          (thanks to Yuval Kogman for pointing problems out)

0.95      2006-04-26
          break out Data::OptList for future disting
          remove an "optimization" that broke expand_opt_list
          improve detection of group generators
          improve data passed to hooks (if you relied on the guts, you'll break)
          the ::Util module

0.93      2006-03-26
          internal refactoring
          add more arguments to collector hook calls

0.92      2006-03-16
          FIX BUG in nested imports: when importing groups A and B, and group B
          includes group A, the nested group would be ignored, even though it
          was not recursing

          allow 'into_level' parameter to setup_exporter
          rewrite collection collector to be more efficient
          rewrite opt list handlers to be more efficient
          restate some code to improve clarity and coverage (now 100%)
          better diagnostic messages
