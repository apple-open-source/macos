    - meta: added repository to metadata [Alexandr Ciornii]

0.21_01 Sat Nov 29 15:24:49 EST 2008

    - added: the ":aggressive" tag may be used to force reloading of 
      Exporter, which often binds caller() prior to Sub::Uplevel's global
      override

0.2002 Thu Sep 11 14:33:09 EDT 2008

    - changed: removed Exporter dependency

    - test fix: fixed strange t/07_uplevel_too_high.t fail on Win32
    
0.2001 Tue Sep  9 22:22:40 EDT 2008

    - test fix: changed prior override test to be more robust (SCHWERN)

0.20 Tue Sep  9 19:23:35 EDT 2008

    - changed: bumped perl requirement to 5.006 and stopped using vars
      (fixes a test bug under Test::More > 0.80)

0.19_03 Fri Jul  4 13:31:21 EDT 2008

    - fixed: load Carp only as needed (fixes problem on 5.005)

0.19_02 Thu Feb 21 14:58:46 EST 2008

    - added: uplevel will warn if uplevel request is more than the call
      stack depth

0.1901 Thu Feb 14 14:07:37 EST 2008

    - fixed: hides the "DB" package from indexers (DB used to support
      @DB::args)
    
0.19 Thu Feb 14 11:50:16 EST 2008

    - bug fix: replacement caller() correctly sets @DB::args if calling
      package is DB

    - repackaging: custom Build.PL, moved all author tests to xt/, added
      LICENSE and INSTALL files

0.15_01 Thu Jul  5 22:54:08 EDT 2007
    - Won't override any existing CORE::GLOBAL::caller when loaded 
    - Localize global caller() override to the scope of the uplevel() call 
      so it can play nicer with things like Contextual::Return and
      Hook::LexWrap that also override caller()

0.14 Sun Nov  5 23:38:46 EST 2006
    - fixed t/99_pod_coverage.t bug
    - added examples directory

    - removed ancient Test::More provided in t/lib
    - switched ok(eq_array()) tests to is_deeper() for better diagnostics
    - added pod/pod coverage checks

    - official release of the uplevel stack patch (fixes RT#13893)

      issues with newline handling and sub-key compatible keyservers
    - updated/added various meta files

0.11_01 Fri Apr 21 00:49:51 EDT 2006
    - uplevel now keeps a proper stack of uplevel calls allowing
      nesting of uplevel and non-uplevel calls

    - Stopped warnings about "undefined" on Perl 5.8.8

    - New die_check.t test was written in a non-portable manner.
      [Thanks Martin Thurn and cpantesters]

0.07  Tue Mar 18 03:03:22 GMT 2003
    - Fixed a test bug due to 5.6.0's differing Carp::croak stack output

0.06  Thu Sep 20 08:50:30 EDT 2001
    * Fixed a bug with deeply nested callers.
    * Fixed nested uplevel() calls.
    - Forgot to include Test::More dependency
    - Added 5.006 dependency to Makefile.PL
    - Removed unnecessary die and warn overrides
    - Added DIRE WARNING to the docs.

0.05  Wed Sep 19 06:00:12 EDT 2001
    * Things were still pretty broken.  I *think* I have the tests
      sorted out now.
    * Blows over any CORE::GLOBAL::caller, die or warn you might have
      set.  I'll fix this soon.

0.04  Wed Sep 19 04:28:19 EDT 2001
    * Ooops, we'd broken caller().  Turns out the tests were wrong.

0.03  Wed Sep 19 03:41:59 EDT 2001
    * Greatly simplified the uplevel logic

0.02  Wed Sep 19 03:03:10 EDT 2001
    * Fools croak()

0.01  Wed Sep 19 00:19:38 EDT 2001
    * First working version
    * Fools caller(), die() and warn().
    - Needs more work against, say, Carp.
    - Needs more work to check that it doesn't break the
      subtleties of caller, die and warn.
