The following is a compilation of various issues developers should be aware of
when developing Web services using SOAP::Lite.

LIMITED WSDL SUPPORT - SOAP::Lite is not capable of generating WSDLs
automatically. If you require a WSDL for a service written using SOAP::Lite,
please consider using a tool like XML Spy, or CapeClear's WSDL Editor.

NO ENTITY DECODING
SOAP::Lite uses XML::Parser::Lite which relies on Unicode support in Perl and
doesn't perform XML ENTITY decoding. 

LIMITED SUPPORT FOR MUSTUNDERSTAND and ACTOR ATTRIBUTES
SOAP::Lite does not currently heed the soap:mustUnderstand XML attribute, or
SOAP actor attributes. 

DOCUMENT-LITERAL SUPPORT
All literal encoding support for SOAP::Lite is marked EXPERIMENTAL, and it is
incomplete. Developers are encouraged to use this capability but should be
fore-warned.
As an alternative, SOAP::WSDL or XML::Compiled::SOAP may be used for 
document/literal bindings derived from WSDL definitions.

CLIENT SIDE WSDL SUPPORT
SOAP::Lites ability to consume a WSDL and generate the necessary message based
on that WSDL is improving, but it does not work with complex types.
As an alternative, SOAP::WSDL or XML::Compiled::SOAP may be used for 
document/literal bindings derived from WSDL definitions.

SERVICE SIDE WSDL SUPPORT
Perl is a loosely typed language making it extraordinarily difficult to generate
a reliable WSDL based upon reflection of somekind. Therefore, no WSDL can be
generated using SOAP::Lite.

SOAP FAULT NOT GETTING SERIALIZED PROPERLY
A user reported that when a service run under Perl version 5.5003 issues the
die command with a SOAP::Fault as input, that SOAP::Lite does not properly
serialize the Fault object. However, the same code works under 5.6 and above.

NULL BODIES
SOAP::Lite currently allows users to construct an Envelope using a null body,
e.g. <Envelope><Body /></Envelope>. However, SOAP::Lite services have no way
of processing such a message.

XML NAMESPACES ABSENT FROM RESPONSES
A user reported that under mod_perl for a series of requests which were using 
SOAP 1.1 and 1.2, that some of the responses to incoming messages lacked the 
XSD and XSI namespace declarations causing an error with the receiving .NET
client for those response lacking these attributes.

OBJECTS BY REFERENCE
SOAP::Server->objects_by_reference is marked EXPERIMENTAL

SOAP CLIENT CRASHES ON WINDOWS 98 WITH BIG MESSAGES
Some users using Windows 98, and an older version of Perl experience a page
fault error in perl58.dll when transmitting/receiving messages over a certain
size. This problem is fixed by upgrading to the latest version of Perl.
