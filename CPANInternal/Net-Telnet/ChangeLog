	* Version 3.03 released.

	* Telnet.pm (getlines): Changed behavior so it works like
	IO::Handle::getlines().  Instead of returning just the lines
	currently available for reading, it now returns all lines until
	end-of-file.  To get the old behavior, use "All => ''" named
	parameter.

	* Telnet.pm (put): New method put() is like print(), except that
	it doesn't write the trailing output_record_separator ("\n").  It
	also takes named parameters.

	* Telnet.pm (last_prompt): New method last_prompt() provides the
	last prompt matched by cmd() or login().

	* Telnet.pm (rs): New method rs() is synonymous with
	input_record_separator().

	* Telnet.pm (ors): New method ors() is synonymous with
	output_record_separator.

	* Telnet.pm (ofs): New method ofs() is synonymous with
	output_field_separator().

	* Telnet.pm (input_log, output_log, option_log): Fixed so they
	always return the filehandle of the logfile or "" if logging
	turned-off.

	* Telnet.pm (dump_log, input_log, option_log, output_log): Fixed
	so they work with an unblessed or tied filehandle.

	* Telnet.pm (cmd_remove_mode, errmode, input_record_separator)
	(max_buffer_length, option_callback, port, prompt, timeout): These
	attribute methods now ignore an invalid argument and print a
	warning to stderr.  This also applies to a named parameter used to
	override one of these attributes.

	* Telnet.pm (cmd): Added named parameters to override Errmode, and
	Input_record_separator.

	* Telnet.pm (get, waitfor): Added named parameters to override
	Binmode, Errmode, and Telnetmode.

	* Telnet.pm (getline, getlines): Added named parameters to
	override Binmode, Errmode, Input_record_separator, and Telnetmode.

	* Telnet.pm (login, open): Added named parameter to override
	Errmode.

	* Telnet.pm (login): Added two 0.01 second delays to workaround
	bug in Linux login program.

	* Telnet.pm (break): Fixed to properly send TELNET break command.

	* Telnet.pm (open): Fixed to properly handle an absolute timeout
	value.

	* Telnet.pm: Squelched the warning "isn't numeric" caused by
	deficiency in ActiveState perl and MS-Windows.

	* t/select.t: Fixed test #3 so it passes when running on Linux 2.4
	or greater.

	* Version 3.02 released.

	* Telnet.pm: Squelched the warning "Ambiguous call resolved as
	CORE::open()" introduced by perl5.005

	* Telnet.pm: Fixed incorrect handling of CR LF when chars are sent
	in separate blocks.

	* Telnet.pm: Modified log routines to accept a tied filehandle.

	* Telnet.pm (get): Fixed to correctly set timed_out() to indicate
	no time-out error when data is not immediately available but
	subsequently arrives and is read before the time-out interval
	expires.

	* Telnet.pm (get): Fixed timeout error when timeout=0, and no
	data read, but there's still data in the buffer yet to be
	returned.

	* Telnet.pm (get): Errmode action now happens when timeout=0 and
	time-out occurs.

1997-12-27  Jay Rogers  <jay@rgrs.com>

	* Version 3.01 released.

	* Telnet.pm (binmode): calling binmode() without an argument no
	longer sets binmode to 1, but rather just returns the current
	value for binmode.

	* Telnet.pm (telnetmode): calling telnetmode() without an argument
	no longer sets telnetmode to 1, but rather just returns the
	current value for telnetmode.

	* Telnet.pm (cmd): Removes the first line of output when the
	remote side told us it would echo or the user requests its removal
	explicitly with cmd_remove_mode()

	* Telnet.pm (cmd_remove_mode): New method that contains the mode
	for how to deal with an echoed back command in the output returned
	by cmd().  Default is set to "auto", which means cmd() removes the
	first line of output when the remote side told us it would echo.

	* Telnet.pm (new): By default, an offer to echo made by the remote
	side of a TELNET connection is always accepted.

	* Telnet.pm (new): Fixed default prompt to work with prompts
	containing $

	* Telnet.pm (fhopen): Changed to work with any open filehandle
	including uni-directional pipes like STDIN.

	* Telnet.pm (host): When passed a null string or undef for a
	hostname it no longer changes it to "localhost".

	* Telnet.pm (waitfor): Now performs error mode action when eof is
	encountered before the pattern match.

	* Telnet.pm (waitfor): Changed text of error messages when
	timing-out.

	* Telnet.pm (login): Changed text of error messages when
	timing-out.

	* Telnet.pm: Fixed non-portable use of \r\n to the more portable
	\015\012.

	* Telnet.pm (break): Fixed to no longer send the
	output_record_separator.

	* Telnet.pm: Stopped erroneously converting input character
	sequences which look like TELNET escaped carriage-returns
	(\015\000), when not in telnetmode.

	* Telnet.pm (buffer): New method that returns scalar reference to
	object's input buffer.

	* Telnet.pm (buffer_empty): New method that discards all data in
	object's input buffer.

	* Telnet.pm (option_accept): New method used to indicate our
	willingness to accept a telnet option offered by the remote side.

	* Telnet.pm (option_callback): New method used to receive
	notification of telnet option negotiation.

	* Telnet.pm (option_log): New method that is used to log option
	negotiation.

	* Telnet.pm (option_state): New method that returns the current
	state of a telnet option.
