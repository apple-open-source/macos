      Thanks to Tina Mueller for prompting me to do this.

    - added a 'follow_best_practice' class method that causes the accessors to
      be called 'get_foo' and 'set_foo' instead of just 'foo'
    - added 'accessor_name_for' and 'mutator_name_for' methods that you can
      override in your subclass to create your own names for accessors.
      (That idea taken from Class::DBI.)
