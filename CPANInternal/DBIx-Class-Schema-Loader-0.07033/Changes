          loaded (previously, the return value wasn't taking
          constraint/exclude into account, even though the meat
          of the operation was).

        - Deprecated dump_overwrite.  The changed behavior from
          0.03xxx was confusing.
        - Added new option really_erase_my_files, which does what
          dump_overwrite did in 0.04000, which is not what it did
          in 0.03xxx.

0.04000  Thu Jun 7, 2007
        - Added some env vars for controlling the Makefile.PL feature

        - Added *experimental* Oracle support from work done
          by Tsunoda Kazuya some months ago.  Not well tested.
        - Added "rescan" schema (and loader) method, which picks
          up newly created tables at runtime
        - Made dump_to_dir / dump_overwrite much more intelligent
          (they now preserve customizations by default)

          method to gather unique key info (only supported by
          DBD::Pg trunk afaik)

          dumping/doing a static create) (from ash)

        - fix for rt.cpan.org #22425 (use File::Spec where appropriate)

0.03005  Wed Jul 19 15:09:30 UTC 2006

        - bugfix: mysql unique constraint code had an
          obvious but longstanding error
        - bugfix: columns were being specified out-of-order,
          bug was introduced in the 0.03004 column metadata
          dumping feature
        - dump code now skips+warns instead of dies when
          dump_overwrite not set

0.03004  Tue Jul 11 04:38:09 UTC 2006
        - make_schema_at efficiency improvements
        - improved debugging output
        - column metadata now included in dumped schemas
        - Carp::Clan added, and some dies converted to croaks
        - no longer overwrites files when dumping, unless asked
          to do so via the dump_overwrite option
        - loader_options can now be embedded in the connection info
        - Documentation improvements
        - Deprecation notices updated, most things that became
          "deprecated" in 0.03 are now marked for death in 0.04000
        - All deprecated usage patterns should now generate annoying
          warnings (most did before).
        - Somewhat improved test coverage

0.03003  Tue Jun  6 02:22:49 UTC 2006
        - Fix inclusion of external add-on class definitions
          in dump_to_dir output.

0.03002  Tue Jun  6 01:27:25 UTC 2006
        - rethrow exceptions that occur during make_schema_at

0.03001  Mon Jun  5 23:17:57 UTC 2006
        - load_from_connection deprecation notice now mentions
          upgrading Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema if that module
          seems to be in use.
        - DBIx::Class required version number fixed
        - Loader statement caching for better load-time performance
        - Improved Pg unique index loader, based on RDBO

        - More docs improvements
        - default uniq_info just warns and returns nothing now,
          instead of dying.  In theory, this allows unsupported

          the generic methods happen to work for that vendor.
        - New tests for the various current and legacy/deprecated
          methods of connecting a Schema::Loader class/object.

          a fix for http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=19164

0.02999_06  Thu May 18 16:32:41 UTC 2006

          branch, resulting in significantly reduced load time

0.02006  Fri Mar 17 04:55:55 UTC 2006
        - Fix long-standing table/col-name case bugs

        - Fixed case-sensitivity issues for table/col names
        - Punt columns_info_for to ->storage

        - Removed unneccesary storage->disconnect

0.02999_03  Mon Mar 13 15:01:11 UTC 2006
        - Added EXAMPLE section to pod [Kieren Diment]
        - Invasive heavy changes to the DBI- and vendor-specific code
          (expect some breakage in some cases until this settles down)
        - Support for loading UNIQUE constraints
        - Tests cleaned up a bit
        - Relationship building seperated out into it's own file for
          the changes that are coming, but still does basically what
          it did before (this work is the next step).

0.02999_02  Sat Mar  4 16:53:21 UTC 2006
        - Merged in relevant changes from trunk since the split

0.02005  Mon Feb 27 23:53:17 UTC 2006
        - Move the external file loading to after everything else
          loader does, in case people want to define, override, or
          build on top of the rels.

0.02004  Mon Feb 27 23:53:17 UTC 2006
        - Minor fix to debugging message for loading external files

0.02999_01  Sun Feb 28 00:24:00 UTC 2006
        - Shuffle the modules around
        - Make ourselves theoretically storage_type-agnostic
        - Remove the _db_classes stuff, bump PK::Auto to Base
        - Change default inflections to Lingua::EN::Inflect::Number::to_PL()

0.02003  Sun Feb 19 20:42:01 UTC 2006
        - Deprecated arguments: dsn, user, password, options
        - New argument: connect_info

0.02002  Sat Feb 18 19:53:12 UTC 2006
        - Added moniker_map and inflect_map

0.02001  Fri Feb 17 20:25:40 UTC 2006
        - tests fixed up a bit
        - auto-loading of on-disk class definitions layered on top
          of the generated definitions (create Foo::Schema::Bar, then
          also try to ->require it if it exists on disk).
        - new parameters components and resultset_components, which do
          the obvious for the generated table classes.
        - DBIx::Class pre-req bumped to 0.05006, since Schema::Loader
          is virtually gauranteed to cause subtle mod_perl problems
          without those fixes.

0.02000  Sun Feb 12 22:43:47 UTC 2006
        - Just docs/version update, 0.01004 code released as 0.02000
