# I encourage you to use -g (debugging).  While it is unlikely you will
# encounter an internal error in Expect, should this happen, I may just need
# the -g information and then you will need to recompile Expect.  As an aside,
# Expect is not a space or time pig, so this won't affect the performance of
# your Expect scripts.
# Note: On Linux systems which only have dynamic X libraries, the -g prevents
# the linker from using them.  So do not use -g on such systems.
