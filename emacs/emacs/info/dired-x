Introduction
************

   This documents the _extra_ features for Dired Mode for GNU Emacs.  It
is derived from version 1.191 of Sebastian Kremer's `dired-x.el'.

   In adopting this `dired-x.el' to GNU Emacs v19 some material that has
been incorporated into `dired.el' and `dired-aux.el' of the GNU Emacs
19 distribution has been removed and some material was modified for
agreement with the functions in `dired.el' and `dired-aux.el'.  For
example, the code using `gmhist' history functions was replaced with
code using the mini-buffer history now built into GNU Emacs.  Finally,
a few other features have been added and a few more functions have been
bound to keys.

Installation
************

This manual describes the Dired features provided by the file
`dired-x.el'.  To take advantage of these features, you must load the
file and (optionally) set some variables.

In your `.emacs' file in your home directory, or in the system-wide
initialization file `default.el' in the `site-lisp' directory, put

     (add-hook 'dired-load-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (load "dired-x")
                 ;; Set dired-x global variables here.  For example:
                 ;; (setq dired-guess-shell-gnutar "gtar")
                 ;; (setq dired-x-hands-off-my-keys nil)
                 ))
     (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 ;; Set dired-x buffer-local variables here.  For example:
                 ;; (setq dired-omit-files-p t)
                 ))

This will load `dired-x.el' when Dired is first invoked (for example,
when you first type `C-x d').

Optional Installation Dired Jump
================================

   In order to have `dired-jump' and `dired-jump-other-window' (*note
Miscellaneous Commands::) work _before_ `dired' and `dired-x' have been
properly loaded the user should set-up an autoload for these functions.
In your `.emacs' file put

     ;;; Autoload `dired-jump' and `dired-jump-other-window'.
     ;;; We autoload from FILE dired.el.  This will then load dired-x.el
     ;;; and hence define `dired-jump' and `dired-jump-other-window'.
     (define-key global-map "\C-x\C-j" 'dired-jump)
     (define-key global-map "\C-x4\C-j" 'dired-jump-other-window)
     
     (autoload (quote dired-jump) "dired" "\
     Jump to Dired buffer corresponding to current buffer.
     If in a file, Dired the current directory and move to file's line.
     If in Dired already, pop up a level and goto old directory's line.
     In case the proper Dired file line cannot be found, refresh the Dired
     buffer and try again." t nil)
     
     (autoload (quote dired-jump-other-window) "dired" "\
     Like \\[dired-jump] (dired-jump) but in other window." t nil)

   Note that in recent releases of GNU Emacs 19 (i.e., 19.25 or later)
the file `../lisp/loaddefs.el' of the Emacs distribution already
contains the proper auto-loading for `dired-jump' so you need only put

     (define-key global-map "\C-x\C-j" 'dired-jump)

in your `.emacs' file in order to have `C-x C-j' work before `dired' is
loaded.


File: dired-x,  Node: Optional Installation File At Point,  Prev: Optional Installation Dired Jump,  Up: Installation

Optional Installation File At Point
===================================

   If you choose to have `dired-x.el' bind `dired-x-find-file' over
`find-file' (*note Find File At Point::), then you will need to set
`dired-x-hands-off-my-keys' and make a call to the function
`dired-x-bind-find-file' in the `dired-load-hook':

     (add-hook 'dired-load-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (load "dired-x")
                 ;; Bind dired-x-find-file.
                 (setq dired-x-hands-off-my-keys nil)
                 ;; Make sure our binding preference is invoked.
                 (dired-x-bind-find-file)
                 ))

   Alternatively, you can set the variable _before_ `dired-x.el' is
loaded

     (add-hook 'dired-load-hook
               (lambda ()
                 ;; Bind dired-x-find-file.
                 (setq dired-x-hands-off-my-keys nil)
                 (load "dired-x")
                 ))

Omitting Files in Dired
***********************

   "Omitting" a file means removing it from the directory listing.
Omitting is useful for keeping Dired buffers free of "uninteresting"
files (for instance, auto-save, auxiliary, backup, and revision control
files) so that the user can concentrate on the interesting files.  Like
hidden files, omitted files are never seen by Dired.  Omitting differs
from hiding in several respects:

   * Omitting works on individual files, not on directories; an entire
     directory cannot be omitted (though each of its files could be).

   * Omitting is wholesale; if omitting is turned on for a Dired
     buffer, then all uninteresting files listed in that buffer are
     omitted.  The user does not omit (or unomit) files one at a time.

   * Omitting can be automatic; uninteresting file lines in the buffer
     can be removed before the user ever sees them.

   * Marked files are never omitted.

`M-o'
     (`dired-omit-toggle') Toggle between displaying and omitting
     "uninteresting" files.  With a prefix argument, just mark the
     files, but don't actually omit them.

In order to make Dired Omit work you first need to load `dired-x.el'
inside `dired-load-hook' (*note Installation::) and then set
`dired-omit-files-p' in some way (*note Omitting Variables::).

* Menu:

* Omitting Variables::
* Omitting Examples::
* Omitting Technical::


File: dired-x,  Node: Omitting Variables,  Next: Omitting Examples,  Up: Omitting Files in Dired

Omitting Variables
==================

   The following variables can be used to customize omitting.

`dired-omit-files-p'
     Default: `nil'

     If non-`nil', "uninteresting" files are not listed.  Uninteresting
     files are those whose files whose names match regexp
     `dired-omit-files', plus those ending with extensions in
     `dired-omit-extensions'.  `M-o' (`dired-omit-toggle') toggles its
     value, which is buffer-local.  Put

          (setq dired-omit-files-p t)

     inside your `dired-mode-hook' to have omitting initially turned on
     in _every_ Dired buffer (*note Installation::).  You can then use
     `M-o' to unomit in that buffer.

     To enable omitting automatically only in certain directories one
     can use Dired Local Variables and put

          Local Variables:
          dired-omit-files-p: t
          End:

     into a file `.dired' (the default value of
     `dired-local-variables-file') in that directory (*note Local
     Variables::).

    `dired-omit-here-always'
          This is an interactive function that creates a local
          variables file exactly like the example above (if it does not
          already exist) in the file `dired-local-variables-file' in
          the current directory and then refreshes the directory
          listing (*note Local Variables::).

`dired-omit-files'
     Default: `"^#\\|\\.$"'

     Files whose names match this buffer-local regexp will not be
     displayed.  This only has effect when `dired-omit-files-p''s value
     is `t'.

     The default value omits the special directories `.' and `..'  and
     autosave files (plus other files ending in `.') (*note Omitting
     Examples::).

`dired-omit-extensions'
     Default: The elements of `completion-ignored-extensions',
     `dired-latex-unclean-extensions', `dired-bibtex-unclean-extensions'
     and `dired-texinfo-unclean-extensions'.

     If non-`nil', a list of extensions (strings) to omit from Dired
     listings.  Its format is the same as that of
     `completion-ignored-extensions'.

`dired-omit-localp'
     Default:  `no-dir'

     The LOCALP argument `dired-omit-expunge' passes to
     `dired-get-filename'.  If it is `no-dir', omitting is much faster,
     but you can only match against the non-directory part of the file
     name.  Set it to `nil' if you need to match the whole file name or
     `t' to match the file name relative to the buffer's top-level
     directory.

`dired-omit-marker-char'
     Default: `C-o'

     Temporary marker used by Dired to implement omitting.  Should
     never be used as marker by the user or other packages.  There is
     one exception to this rule: by adding

          (setq dired-mark-keys "\C-o")
          ;; i.e., the value of dired-omit-marker-char
          ;; (which is not defined yet)

     to your `~/.emacs', you can bind the `C-o' key to insert a `C-o'
     marker, thus causing these files to be omitted in addition to the
     usually omitted files.  Unfortunately the files you omitted
     manually this way will show up again after reverting the buffer,
     unlike the others.

Examples of Omitting Various File Types
=======================================

   * If you wish to avoid seeing RCS files and the `RCS' directory,
     then put

          (setq dired-omit-files
                (concat dired-omit-files "\\|^RCS$\\|,v$"))

     in the `dired-load-hook' (*note Installation::).  This assumes
     `dired-omit-localp' has its default value of `no-dir' to make the
     `^'-anchored matches work.  As a slower alternative, with
     `dired-omit-localp' set to `nil', you can use `/' instead of `^'
     in the regexp.

   * If you use `tib', the bibliography program for use with TeX and
     LaTeX, and you want to omit the `INDEX' and the `*-t.tex' files,
     then put

          (setq dired-omit-files
                (concat dired-omit-files "\\|^INDEX$\\|-t\\.tex$"))

     in the `dired-load-hook' (*note Installation::).

   * If you do not wish to see `dot' files (files starting with a `.'),
     then put

          (setq dired-omit-files
                (concat dired-omit-files "\\|^\\..+$"))

     in the `dired-load-hook' (*note Installation::).

Some Technical Details of Omitting
==================================

   Loading `dired-x.el' will install Dired Omit by putting
`dired-omit-expunge' on your `dired-after-readin-hook', and will call
`dired-extra-startup', which in turn calls `dired-omit-startup' in your
`dired-mode-hook'.

Local Variables for Dired Directories
*************************************

When Dired visits a directory, it looks for a file whose name is the
value of variable `dired-local-variables-file' (default: `.dired').  If
such a file is found, Dired will temporarily insert it into the Dired
buffer and run `hack-local-variables'.

For example, if the user puts

     Local Variables:
     dired-actual-switches: "-lat"
     dired-omit-files-p: t
     End:

into a file called `.dired' in a directory then when that directory is
viewed it will be

  1. sorted by date

  2. omitted automatically

You can set `dired-local-variables-file' to `nil' to suppress this.
The value of `dired-enable-local-variables' controls if and how these
local variables are read.  This variable exists so that if may override
the default value of `enable-local-variables'.

Please see the GNU Emacs Manual to learn more about local variables.
*Note Local Variables in Files: (emacs)File Variables.

The following variables affect Dired Local Variables

`dired-local-variables-file'
     Default: `".dired"'

     If non-`nil', file name for local variables for Dired.  If Dired
     finds a file with that name in the current directory, it will
     temporarily insert it into the Dired buffer and run
     `hack-local-variables'.

`dired-enable-local-variables'
     Default: `t'

     Controls the use of local-variables lists in Dired.  The value can
     be `t', `nil', or something else.  A value of `t' means
     local-variables lists are obeyed in the
     `dired-local-variables-file'; `nil' means they are ignored;
     anything else means query.  This variable temporarily overrides
     the value of `enable-local-variables' when the Dired Local
     Variables are hacked.


File: dired-x,  Node: Shell Command Guessing,  Next: Virtual Dired,  Prev: Local Variables,  Up: Top

Shell Command Guessing
**********************

   Based upon the name of a file, Dired tries to guess what shell
command you might want to apply to it.  For example, if you have point
on a file named `foo.tar' and you press `!', Dired will guess you want
to `tar xvf' it and suggest that as the default shell command.

   The default is mentioned in brackets and you can type `M-p' to get
the default into the minibuffer and then edit it, e.g., to change `tar
xvf' to `tar tvf'.  If there are several commands for a given file,
e.g., `xtex' and `dvips' for a `.dvi' file, you can type `M-p' several
times to see each of the matching commands.

   Dired only tries to guess a command for a single file, never for a
list of marked files.

`dired-guess-shell-alist-default'
     Predefined rules for shell commands.  Set this to `nil' to turn
     guessing off.  The elements of `dired-guess-shell-alist-user'
     (defined by the user) will override these rules.

`dired-guess-shell-alist-user'
     If non-`nil', a user-defined alist of file regexps and their
     suggested commands.  These rules take precedence over the
     predefined rules in the variable `dired-guess-shell-alist-default'
     (to which they are prepended) when `dired-do-shell-command' is
     run).

     Each element of the alist looks like

          (REGEXP COMMAND...)

     where each COMMAND can either be a string or a lisp expression
     that evaluates to a string.  If several commands are given, all of
     them will temporarily be pushed onto the history.

     You can set this variable in your `~/.emacs'.  For example, to add
     rules for `.foo' and `.bar' file extensions, write

          (setq dired-guess-shell-alist-user
                (list
                 (list "\\.foo$" "FOO-COMMAND");; fixed rule
                 ;; possibly more rules...
                 (list "\\.bar$";; rule with condition test
                        '(if CONDITION
                             "BAR-COMMAND-1"
                           "BAR-COMMAND-2"))))

     This will override any predefined rules for the same extensions.

`dired-guess-shell-gnutar'
     Default: `nil'

     If non-`nil', this is the name of the GNU Tar executable (e.g.,
     `tar' or `gnutar').  GNU Tar's `z' switch is used for compressed
     tar files.  If you don't have GNU tar, set this to `nil': a pipe
     using `zcat' is then used.

`dired-guess-shell-gzip-quiet'
     Default: `t'

     A non-`nil' value means that `-q' is passed to `gzip' overriding a
     verbose option in the `GZIP' environment variable.

`dired-guess-shell-znew-switches nil'
     Default: `nil'

     A string of switches passed to `znew'.  An example is `-K' which
     will make `znew' keep a `.Z' file when it is smaller than the
     `.gz' file.

`dired-shell-command-history nil'
     History list for commands that read dired-shell commands.

Virtual Dired
*************

   Using "Virtual Dired" means putting a buffer with Dired-like
contents in Dired mode.  The files described by the buffer contents need
not actually exist.  This is useful if you want to peruse an `ls -lR'
output file, for example one you got from an FTP server.  You can use
all motion commands usually available in Dired.  You can also use it to
save a Dired buffer in a file and resume it in a later session.

   Type `M-x dired-virtual' to put the current buffer into virtual
Dired mode.  You will be prompted for the top level directory of this
buffer, with a default value guessed from the buffer contents.  To
convert the virtual to a real Dired buffer again, type `g' (which calls
`dired-virtual-revert') in the virtual Dired buffer and answer `y'.
You don't have to do this, though: you can relist single subdirectories
using `l' (`dired-do-redisplay') on the subdirectory headerline,
leaving the buffer in virtual Dired mode all the time.

   The function `dired-virtual-mode' is specially designed to turn on
virtual Dired mode from the `auto-mode-alist'.  To edit all `*.dired'
files automatically in virtual Dired mode, put this into your
`~/.emacs':

     (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("[^/]\\.dired$" . dired-virtual-mode)
                                   auto-mode-alist))

The regexp is a bit more complicated than usual to exclude `.dired'
local-variable files.

Advanced Mark Commands
**********************

`F'
     (`dired-do-find-marked-files') Find all marked files at once
     displaying them simultaneously.  If optional NOSELECT is non-`nil'
     then just find the files but do not select.  If you want to keep
     the Dired buffer displayed, type `C-x 2' first.  If you want just
     the marked files displayed and nothing else, type `C-x 1' first.

     The current window is split across all files marked, as evenly as
     possible.  Remaining lines go to the bottom-most window.  The
     number of files that can be displayed this way is restricted by
     the height of the current window and the variable
     `window-min-height'.

`dired-mark-extension'
     Mark all files with a certain extension for use in later commands.
     A `.' is not automatically prepended to the string entered, you
     must type it explicitly.

     When called from Lisp, EXTENSION may also be a list of extensions
     and an optional argument MARKER-CHAR specifies the marker used.

`dired-flag-extension'
     Flag all files with a certain extension for deletion.  A `.' is
     _not_ automatically prepended to the string entered.

Special Marking Function
========================

`M-('
     (`dired-mark-sexp') Mark files for which PREDICATE returns
     non-`nil'.  With a prefix argument, unflag those files instead.

     The PREDICATE is a lisp expression that can refer to the following
     symbols:
    `inode'
          [integer] the inode of the file (only for `ls -i' output)

    `s'
          [integer] the size of the file for `ls -s' output (usually in
          blocks or, with `-k', in KBytes)

    `mode'
          [string]  file permission bits, e.g., `-rw-r--r--'

    `nlink'
          [integer] number of links to file

    `uid'
          [string]  owner

    `gid'
          [string]  group  (If the gid is not displayed by `ls', this
          will still be set (to the same as uid))

    `size'
          [integer] file size in bytes

    `time'
          [string]  the time that `ls' displays, e.g., `Feb 12 14:17'

    `name'
          [string]  the name of the file

    `sym'
          [string]  if file is a symbolic link, the linked-to name,
          else `""'

     For example, use
          (equal 0 size)
     to mark all zero length files.

     To find out all not yet compiled Emacs lisp files in a directory,
     Dired all `.el' files in the lisp directory using the wildcard
     `*.el'.  Then use `M-(' with
          (not (file-exists-p (concat name "c")))
     to mark all `.el' files without a corresponding `.elc' file.

Multiple Dired Directories and Non-Dired Commands
*************************************************

   An Emacs buffer can have but one working directory, stored in the
buffer-local variable `default-directory'.  A Dired buffer may have
several subdirectories inserted, but it still has only one working
directory: that of the top-level Dired directory in that buffer.  For
some commands it is appropriate that they use the current Dired
directory instead of `default-directory', e.g., `find-file' and
`compile'.

   A general mechanism is provided for special handling of the working
directory in special major modes:

`default-directory-alist'
     Default: `((dired-mode . (dired-current-directory)))'

     Alist of major modes and their notion of `default-directory', as a
     lisp expression to evaluate.  A resulting value of `nil' is ignored
     in favor of `default-directory'.

`default-directory'
     Function with usage like variable `default-directory', but knows
     about the special cases in variable `default-directory-alist'.


File: dired-x,  Node: Find File At Point,  Next: Miscellaneous Commands,  Prev: Multiple Dired Directories,  Up: Top

Find File At Point
==================

   `dired-x' provides a method of visiting or editing a file mentioned
in the buffer you are viewing (e.g., a mail buffer, a news article, a
`README' file, etc.) or to test if that file exists.  You can then
modify this in the minibuffer after snatching the file name.

   When installed `dired-x' will substitute `dired-x-find-file' for
`find-file' (normally bound to `C-x C-f') and
`dired-x-find-file-other-window' for `find-file-other-window' (normally
bound to `C-x 4 C-f').

   In order to use this feature, you will need to set
`dired-x-hands-off-my-keys' to `nil' inside `dired-load-hook' (*note
Optional Installation File At Point::).

`dired-x-find-file'
     `dired-x-find-file' behaves exactly like `find-file' (normally
     bound to `C-x C-f') unless a prefix argument is passed to the
     function in which case it will use the file name at point as a
     guess for the file to visit.

     For example, if the buffer you were reading contained the words

          Available via anonymous ftp in
          
             /roebling.poly.edu:/pub/lisp/crypt++.el.gz

     then you could move your cursor to the line containing the ftp
     address and type `C-u C-x C-f' (the `C-u' is a universal
     argument).  The minibuffer would read

          Find file: /roebling.poly.edu:/pub/lisp/crypt++.el.gz

     with the point after the last `/'.  If you hit <RET>, emacs will
     visit the file at that address.  This also works with files on
     your own computer.

`dired-x-find-file-other-window'
     `dired-x-find-file-other-window' behaves exactly like
     `find-file-other-window' (normally bound to `C-x 4 C-f') unless a
     prefix argument is used.  See `dired-x-find-file' for more
     information.

`dired-x-hands-off-my-keys'
     If set to `t', then it means that `dired-x' should _not_ bind
     `dired-x-find-file' over `find-file' on keyboard.  Similarly, it
     should not bind `dired-x-find-file-other-window' over
     `find-file-other-window'.  If you change this variable after
     `dired-x.el' is loaded then do `M-x dired-x-bind-find-file'.  The
     default value of this variable is `t'; by default, the binding is
     not done.  See *Note Optional Installation File At Point::.

`dired-x-bind-find-file'
     A function, which can be called interactively or in your
     `~/.emacs' file, that uses the value of
     `dired-x-hands-off-my-keys' to determine if `dired-x-find-file'
     should be bound over `find-file' and
     `dired-x-find-file-other-window' bound over
     `find-file-other-window'.  See *Note Optional Installation File At
     Point::.


File: dired-x,  Node: Miscellaneous Commands,  Next: Bugs,  Prev: Find File At Point,  Up: Top

Miscellaneous Commands
**********************

   Miscellaneous features not fitting anywhere else:

`dired-find-subdir'
     Default: `nil'

     If non-`nil', Dired does not make a new buffer for a directory if
     it can be found (perhaps as subdirectory) in some existing Dired
     buffer.

     If there are several Dired buffers for a directory, the most
     recently used is chosen.

     Dired avoids switching to the current buffer, so that if you have a
     normal and a wildcard buffer for the same directory, `C-x d RET'
     will toggle between those two.

`M-g'
     (`dired-goto-file') Go to the line of a file (or directory).

`M-G'
     (`dired-goto-subdir') Go to the header line of an inserted
     directory.  This command reads its argument, with completion
     derived from the names of the inserted subdirectories.

`w'
     (`dired-copy-filename-as-kill') The `w' command puts the names of
     the marked (or next N) files into the kill ring, as if you had
     killed them with `C-w'.  With a zero prefix argument N=0, use the
     complete pathname of each file.  With a raw (just `C-u') prefix
     argument, use the relative pathname of each marked file.  As a
     special case, if no prefix argument is given and point is on a
     directory headerline, it gives you the name of that directory,
     without looking for marked files.

     The list of names is also stored onto the variable
     `dired-marked-files' for use, e.g., in the `M-:'
     (`eval-expression') command.

     As this command also displays what was pushed onto the kill ring,
     you can use it to display the list of currently marked files in the
     echo area (unless you happen to be on a subdirectory headerline).

     You can then feed the file name to other Emacs commands with `C-y'.
     For example, say you want to rename a file with a long name to a
     slightly different name.  First type `w' to push the old name onto
     the kill ring.  Then type `R' to rename it and use `C-y' inside
     `R''s minibuffer prompt to insert the old name at a convenient
     place.

`T'
     (`dired-do-toggle') Toggle marks.  That is, currently marked files
     become unmarked and vice versa.  Files marked with other flags
     (such as `D') are not affected.  The special directories `.' and
     `..' are never toggled.

`dired-smart-shell-command'
     Like function `shell-command', but in the current Dired directory.
     Bound to `M-!' in Dired buffers.

`dired-jump'
     Bound to `C-x C-j'.  Jump back to Dired: If in a file, edit the
     current directory and move to file's line.  If in Dired already,
     pop up a level and go to old directory's line.  In case the proper
     Dired file line cannot be found, refresh the Dired buffer and try
     again.

`dired-jump-other-window'
     Bound to `C-x 4 C-j'. Like `dired-jump', but to other window.

     These functions can be autoloaded so they work even though
     `dired-x.el' has not been loaded yet (*note Optional Installation
     Dired Jump::).

     If the variable `dired-bind-jump' is `nil', `dired-jump' will not
     be bound to `C-x C-j' and `dired-jump-other-window' will not be
     bound to `C-x 4 C-j'.

`dired-vm'
     Bound to `V' if `dired-bind-vm' is t.  Run VM on this file (assumed
     to be a UNIX mail folder).

     If you give this command a prefix argument, it will visit the
     folder read-only.  This only works in VM 5, not VM 4.

     If the variable `dired-vm-read-only-folders' is `t', `dired-vm'
     will visit all folders read-only.  If it is neither `nil' nor `t',
     e.g., the symbol `if-file-read-only', only files not writable by
     you are visited read-only.  This is the recommended value if you
     run VM 5.

     If the variable `dired-bind-vm' is t, `dired-vm' will be bound to
     `V'.  Otherwise, `dired-bind-rmail' will be bound.

`dired-rmail'
     Bound to `V' if `dired-bind-vm' is `nil'.  Run Rmail on this file
     (assumed to be mail folder in Rmail/BABYL format).

`dired-info'
     Bound to `I'.  Run Info on this file (assumed to be a file in Info
     format).

     If the variable `dired-bind-info' is `nil', `dired-info' will not
     be bound to `I'.

`dired-man'
     Bound to `N'.  Run man on this file (assumed to be a file in
     `nroff' format).

     If the variable `dired-bind-man' is `nil', `dired-man' will not be
     bound to `N'.

`dired-do-relative-symlink'
     Bound to `Y'.  Relative symlink all marked (or next ARG) files
     into a directory, or make a relative symbolic link to the current
     file.  This creates relative symbolic links like

              foo -> ../bar/foo

     not absolute ones like

              foo -> /ugly/path/that/may/change/any/day/bar/foo

`dired-do-relative-symlink-regexp'
     Bound to `%Y'.  Relative symlink all marked files containing
     REGEXP to NEWNAME.  See functions `dired-do-rename-regexp' and
     `dired-do-relsymlink' for more info.
