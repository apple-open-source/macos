   This is the GNU Emacs FAQ, last updated on 16 March 2002.

   The FAQ is maintained as a Texinfo document, allowing us to create
HTML, Info, and TeX documents from a single source file, and is slowly
but surely being improved.  Please bear with us as we improve on this
format.  If you have any suggestions or questions, please contact the
FAQ maintainers <emacs-faq@lerner.co.il>.

FAQ notation
************

   This chapter describes notation used in the GNU Emacs FAQ, as well
as in the Emacs documentation.  Consult this section if this is the
first time you are reading the FAQ, or if you are confused by notation
or terms used in the FAQ.

File: efaq,  Node: Basic keys,  Next: Extended commands,  Prev: FAQ notation,  Up: FAQ notation

What do these mean: `C-h', `M-C-a', <RET>, `<ESC> a', etc.?
===========================================================

   * `C-x': press the <x> key while holding down the <Control> key

   * `M-x': press the <x> key while holding down the <Meta> key (if
     your computer doesn't have a <Meta> key, *note No Meta key::)

   * `M-C-x': press the <x> key while holding down both <Control> and
     <Meta>

   * `C-M-x': a synonym for the above

   * <LFD>: Linefeed or Newline; same as `C-j'

   * <RET>: <Return>, sometimes marked <Enter>; same as `C-m'

   * <DEL>: <Delete>, usually *not* the same as <Backspace>; same as
     `C-?' (see *Note Backspace invokes help::, if deleting invokes
     Emacs help)

   * <ESC>: Escape; same as `C-['

   * <TAB>: Tab; same as `C-i'

   * <SPC>: Space bar


   Key sequences longer than one key (and some single-key sequences) are
written inside quotes or on lines by themselves, like this:

       M-x frobnicate-while-foo RET

Any real spaces in such a key sequence should be ignored; only <SPC>
really means press the space key.

   The ASCII code sent by `C-x' (except for `C-?') is the value that
would be sent by pressing just <x> minus 96 (or 64 for upper-case <X>)
and will be from 0 to 31.  On Unix and GNU/Linux terminals, the ASCII
code sent by `M-x' is the sum of 128 and the ASCII code that would be
sent by pressing just <x>.  Essentially, <Control> turns off bits 5 and
6 and <Meta> turns on bit 7(1).

   `C-?' (aka <DEL>) is ASCII code 127.  It is a misnomer to call `C-?'
a "control" key, since 127 has both bits 5 and 6 turned ON.  Also, on
very few keyboards does `C-?' generate ASCII code 127.

   *note Text Characters: (emacs)Text Characters, and *note Keys:
(emacs)Keys, for more information.  (*Note On-line manual::, for more
information about Info.)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) DOS and Windows terminals don't set bit 7 when the <Meta> key is
pressed.


File: efaq,  Node: Extended commands,  Next: On-line manual,  Prev: Basic keys,  Up: FAQ notation

What does `M-x COMMAND' mean?
=============================

   `M-x COMMAND' means type `M-x', then type the name of the command,
then type <RET>.  (*Note Basic keys::, if you're not sure what `M-x'
and <RET> mean.)

   `M-x' (by default) invokes the command `execute-extended-command'.
This command allows you to run any Emacs command if you can remember
the command's name.  If you can't remember the command's name, you can
type <TAB> and <SPC> for completion, <?> for a list of possibilities,
and `M-p' and `M-n' (or up-arrow and down-arrow on terminals that have
these editing keys) to see previous commands entered.  An Emacs
"command" is an "interactive" Emacs function.

   Your system administrator may have bound other key sequences to
invoke `execute-extended-command'.  A function key labeled `Do' is a
good candidate for this, on keyboards that have such a key.

   If you need to run non-interactive Emacs functions, see *Note
Evaluating Emacs Lisp code::.


File: efaq,  Node: On-line manual,  Next: File-name conventions,  Prev: Extended commands,  Up: FAQ notation

How do I read topic XXX in the on-line manual?
==============================================

   When we refer you to some TOPIC in the on-line manual, you can read
this manual node inside Emacs (assuming nothing is broken) by typing
`C-h i m emacs <RET> m TOPIC <RET>'.

   This invokes Info, the GNU hypertext documentation browser.  If you
don't already know how to use Info, type <?> from within Info.

   If we refer to TOPIC:SUBTOPIC, type `C-h i m emacs <RET> m TOPIC
<RET> m SUBTOPIC <RET>'.

   If these commands don't work as expected, your system administrator
may not have installed the Info files, or may have installed them
improperly.  In this case you should complain.

   *Note Getting a printed manual::, if you would like a paper copy of
the Emacs manual.


File: efaq,  Node: File-name conventions,  Next: Common acronyms,  Prev: On-line manual,  Up: FAQ notation

What are `etc/SERVICE', `src/config.h', and `lisp/default.el'?
==============================================================

   These are files that come with Emacs.  The Emacs distribution is
divided into subdirectories; the important ones are `etc', `lisp', and
`src'.

   If you use Emacs, but don't know where it is kept on your system,
start Emacs, then type `C-h v data-directory <RET>'.  The directory
name displayed by this will be the full pathname of the installed `etc'
directory.  (This full path is recorded in the Emacs variable
`data-directory', and `C-h v' displays the value and the documentation
of a variable.)

   The location of your Info directory (i.e., where on-line
documentation is stored) is kept in the variable
`Info-default-directory-list'.  Use `C-h v Info-default-directory-list
<RET>' to see the value of this variable, which will be a list of
directory names.  The last directory in that list is probably where
most Info files are stored.  By default, Info documentation is placed
in `/usr/local/info'.

   Some of these files are available individually via FTP or e-mail; see
*Note Informational files for Emacs::.  They all are available in the
source distribution.  Many of the files in the `etc' directory are also
available via the Emacs `Help' menu, or by typing `C-h ?' (`M-x
help-for-help').

   Your system administrator may have removed the `src' directory and
many files from the `etc' directory.


File: efaq,  Node: Common acronyms,  Prev: File-name conventions,  Up: FAQ notation

What are FSF, LPF, OSF, GNU, RMS, FTP, and GPL?
===============================================

FSF
     Free Software Foundation

LPF
     League for Programming Freedom

OSF
     Open Software Foundation

GNU
     GNU's Not Unix

RMS
     Richard Matthew Stallman

FTP
     File Transfer Protocol

GPL
     GNU General Public License

   Avoid confusing the FSF, the LPF, and the OSF.  The LPF opposes
look-and-feel copyrights and software patents.  The FSF aims to make
high quality free software available for everyone.  The OSF is a
consortium of computer vendors which develops commercial software for
Unix systems.

   The word "free" in the title of the Free Software Foundation refers
to "freedom," not "zero dollars."  Anyone can charge any price for
GPL-covered software that they want to.  However, in practice, the
freedom enforced by the GPL leads to low prices, because you can always
get the software for less money from someone else, since everyone has
the right to resell or give away GPL-covered software.

File: efaq,  Node: The LPF,  Next: Real meaning of copyleft,  Prev: General questions,  Up: General questions

What is the LPF?
================

   The LPF opposes the expanding danger of software patents and
look-and-feel copyrights.  To get more information, feel free to contact
the LPF via e-mail or otherwise.  You may also contact Joe Wells
<jbw@cs.bu.edu>; he will be happy to talk to you about the LPF.

   You can find more information about the LPF in the file `etc/LPF'.
More papers describing the LPF's views are available on the Internet and
also from the LPF home page (http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/).


File: efaq,  Node: Real meaning of copyleft,  Next: Guidelines for newsgroup postings,  Prev: The LPF,  Up: General questions

What is the real legal meaning of the GNU copyleft?
===================================================

   The real legal meaning of the GNU General Public License (copyleft)
will only be known if and when a judge rules on its validity and scope.
There has never been a copyright infringement case involving the GPL to
set any precedents.  Please take any discussion regarding this issue to
the newsgroup `news:gnu.misc.discuss', which was created to hold the
extensive flame wars on the subject.

   RMS writes:

     The legal meaning of the GNU copyleft is less important than the
     spirit, which is that Emacs is a free software project and that
     work pertaining to Emacs should also be free software.  "Free"
     means that all users have the freedom to study, share, change and
     improve Emacs.  To make sure everyone has this freedom, pass along
     source code when you distribute any version of Emacs or a related
     program, and give the recipients the same freedom that you enjoyed.


File: efaq,  Node: Guidelines for newsgroup postings,  Next: Newsgroup archives,  Prev: Real meaning of copyleft,  Up: General questions

What are appropriate messages for `news:gnu.emacs.help', `news:gnu.emacs.bug', `news:comp.emacs', etc.?
=======================================================================================================

   The file `etc/MAILINGLISTS' describes the purpose of each GNU
mailing list.  (*Note Informational files for Emacs::, if you want a
copy of the file.)  For those lists which are gatewayed with
newsgroups, it lists both the newsgroup name and the mailing list
address.

   The newsgroup `news:comp.emacs' is for discussion of Emacs programs
in general.  This includes Emacs along with various other
implementations, such as XEmacs, JOVE, MicroEmacs, Freemacs, MG,
Unipress, CCA, and Epsilon.

   Many people post Emacs questions to `news:comp.emacs' because they
don't receive any of the `gnu.*' newsgroups.  Arguments have been made
both for and against posting GNU-Emacs-specific material to
`news:comp.emacs'.  You have to decide for yourself.

   Messages advocating "non-free" software are considered unacceptable
on any of the `gnu.*' newsgroups except for `news:gnu.misc.discuss',
which was created to hold the extensive flame-wars on the subject.
"Non-free" software includes any software for which the end user can't
freely modify the source code and exchange enhancements.  Be careful to
remove the `gnu.*' groups from the `Newsgroups:' line when posting a
followup that recommends such software.

   `news:gnu.emacs.bug' is a place where bug reports appear, but avoid
posting bug reports to this newsgroup directly (*note Reporting bugs::).


File: efaq,  Node: Newsgroup archives,  Next: Reporting bugs,  Prev: Guidelines for newsgroup postings,  Up: General questions

Where can I get old postings to `news:gnu.emacs.help' and other GNU groups?
===========================================================================

   The FSF has maintained archives of all of the GNU mailing lists for
many years, although there may be some unintentional gaps in coverage.
The archive is not particularly well organized or easy to retrieve
individual postings from, but pretty much everything is there.

   The archive is at `ftp://ftp-mailing-list-archives.gnu.org'.

   As of this writing, the archives are not yet working.

   Web-based Usenet search services, such as DejaNews
(http://www.dejanews.com), also archive the `gnu.*' groups.


File: efaq,  Node: Reporting bugs,  Next: Unsubscribing from Emacs lists,  Prev: Newsgroup archives,  Up: General questions

Where should I report bugs and other problems with Emacs?
=========================================================

   The correct way to report Emacs bugs is by e-mail to
<bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org>.  Anything sent here also appears in the
newsgroup `news:gnu.emacs.bug', but please use e-mail instead of news
to submit the bug report.  This ensures a reliable return address so
you can be contacted for further details.

   Be sure to read the "Bugs" section of the Emacs manual before
reporting a bug to bug-gnu-emacs!  The manual describes in detail how
to submit a useful bug report.  (*Note On-line manual::, if you don't
know how to read the manual.)

   RMS says:

     Sending bug reports to <help-gnu-emacs@gnu.org> (which has the
     effect of posting on `news:gnu.emacs.help') is undesirable because
     it takes the time of an unnecessarily large group of people, most
     of whom are just users and have no idea how to fix these problem.
     <bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org> reaches a much smaller group of people who
     are more likely to know what to do and have expressed a wish to
     receive more messages about Emacs than the others.

   RMS says it is sometimes fine to post to `news:gnu.emacs.help':

     If you have reported a bug and you don't hear about a possible fix,
     then after a suitable delay (such as a week) it is okay to post on
     `gnu.emacs.help' asking if anyone can help you.

   If you are unsure whether you have found a bug, consider the
following non-exhaustive list, courtesy of RMS:

     If Emacs crashes, that is a bug.  If Emacs gets compilation errors
     while building, that is a bug.  If Emacs crashes while building,
     that is a bug.  If Lisp code does not do what the documentation
     says it does, that is a bug.

How do I unsubscribe from this mailing list?
============================================

   If you are receiving a GNU mailing list named LIST, you might be
able to unsubscribe from it by sending a request to the address
<LIST-request@gnu.org>.  However, this will not work if you are not
listed on the main mailing list, but instead receive the mail from a
distribution point.  In that case, you will have to track down at which
distribution point you are listed.  Inspecting the `Received' headers
on the mail messages may help, along with liberal use of the `EXPN' or
`VRFY' sendmail commands through `telnet SITE-ADDRESS smtp'.  Ask your
postmaster for help, if you cannot figure out these details.

I'm just starting Emacs; how do I do basic editing?
===================================================

   Type `C-h t' to invoke the self-paced tutorial.  Just typing `C-h'
enters the help system.

   Your system administrator may have changed `C-h' to act like <DEL>
to deal with local keyboards.  You can use `M-x help-for-help' instead
to invoke help.  To discover what key (if any) invokes help on your
system, type `M-x where-is <RET> help-for-help <RET>'.  This will print
a comma-separated list of key sequences in the echo area.  Ignore the
last character in each key sequence listed.  Each of the resulting key
sequences invokes help.

   Emacs help works best if it is invoked by a single key whose value
should be stored in the variable `help-char'.

   There is also a WWW-based tutorial for Emacs 18, much of which is
also relevant for later versions of Emacs, available at

   `http://kufacts.cc.ukans.edu/cwis/writeups/misc/emacsguide.html'


File: efaq,  Node: Learning how to do something,  Next: Getting a printed manual,  Prev: Basic editing,  Up: Getting help

How do I find out how to do something in Emacs?
===============================================

   There are several methods for finding out how to do things in Emacs.

   * The complete text of the Emacs manual is available on-line via the
     Info hypertext reader.  Type `C-h i' to invoke Info.  Typing <h>
     immediately after entering Info will provide a short tutorial on
     how to use it.

   * To quickly locate the section of the manual which discusses a
     certain issue, or describes a command or a variable, type `C-h i m
     emacs <RET> i TOPIC <RET>', where TOPIC is the name of the topic,
     the command, or the variable which you are looking for.  If this
     does not land you on the right place in the manual, press `,'
     (comma) repeatedly until you find what you need.  (The `i' and `,'
     keys invoke the index-searching functions, which look for the
     TOPIC you type in all the indices of the Emacs manual.)

   * You can list all of the commands whose names contain a certain word
     (actually which match a regular expression) using `C-h a' (`M-x
     command-apropos').

   * The command `C-h C-f' (`Info-goto-emacs-command-node') prompts for
     the name of a command, and then attempts to find the section in the
     Emacs manual where that command is described.

   * You can list all of the functions and variables whose names
     contain a certain word using `M-x apropos'.

   * You can list all of the functions and variables whose documentation
     matches a regular expression or a string, using `M-x
     apropos-documentation'.

   * You can order a hardcopy of the manual from the FSF.  *Note
     Getting a printed manual::.

   * You can get a printed reference card listing commands and keys to
     invoke them.  You can order one from the FSF for $1 (or 10 for $5),
     or you can print your own from the `etc/refcard.tex' or
     `etc/refcard.ps' files in the Emacs distribution.  Beginning with
     version 21.1, the Emacs distribution comes with translations of the
     reference card into several languages; look for files named
     `etc/LANG-refcard.*', where LANG is a two-letter code of the
     language.  For example, the German version of the reference card
     is in the files `etc/de-refcard.tex' and `etc/de-refcard.ps'.

   * There are many other commands in Emacs for getting help and
     information.  To get a list of these commands, type `?' after
     `C-h'.



File: efaq,  Node: Getting a printed manual,  Next: Emacs Lisp documentation,  Prev: Learning how to do something,  Up: Getting help

How do I get a printed copy of the Emacs manual?
================================================

   You can order a printed copy of the Emacs manual from the FSF.  For
details see the GNU Web site (http://www.gnu.org/order/order.html) and
the file `etc/ORDERS'.

   The full Texinfo source for the manual also comes in the `man'
directory of the Emacs distribution, if you're daring enough to try to
print out this 620-page manual yourself (*note Printing a Texinfo
file::).

   If you absolutely have to print your own copy, and you don't have
TeX, you can get a PostScript version from

   `http://www.gnu.org/manual/emacs/ps/emacs.ps.gz'

   An HTML version of the manual is at

   `www.gnu.org/manual/emacs/index.html'

   *Note Learning how to do something::, for how to view the manual
on-line.


File: efaq,  Node: Emacs Lisp documentation,  Next: Installing Texinfo documentation,  Prev: Getting a printed manual,  Up: Getting help

Where can I get documentation on Emacs Lisp?
============================================

   Within Emacs, you can type `C-h f' to get the documentation for a
function, `C-h v' for a variable.

   For more information, obtain the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual.
Details on ordering it from FSF are on the GNU Web site
(http://www.gnu.org/order/order.html) and in the file `etc/ORDERS'.

   The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual is also available on-line, in Info
format.  Texinfo source for the manual (along with pregenerated Info
files) is available at

   `ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-manual-21-2.6.tar.gz'

   and all mirrors of `ftp.gnu.org' (for a list, *note Current GNU
distributions::).  *Note Installing Texinfo documentation::, if you want
to install the Info files, or *Note Printing a Texinfo file::, if you
want to use the Texinfo source to print the manual yourself.

   An HTML version of the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual is available at

   `http://www.gnu.org/manual/elisp-manual-21-2.6/elisp.html'


File: efaq,  Node: Installing Texinfo documentation,  Next: Printing a Texinfo file,  Prev: Emacs Lisp documentation,  Up: Getting help

How do I install a piece of Texinfo documentation?
==================================================

   First, you must turn the Texinfo files into Info files.  You may do
this using the stand-alone `makeinfo' program, available as part of the
latest Texinfo package at

   `ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/texinfo/texinfo-4.0.tar.gz'

   and all mirrors of `ftp.gnu.org' (for a list, *note Current GNU
distributions::).

   For information about the Texinfo format, read the Texinfo manual
which comes with the Texinfo package.  This manual also comes installed
in Info format, so you can read it on-line; type `C-h i m texinfo
<RET>'.

   Alternatively, you could use the Emacs command `M-x
texinfo-format-buffer', after visiting the Texinfo source file of the
manual you want to convert.

   Neither `texinfo-format-buffer' nor `makeinfo' installs the
resulting Info files in Emacs's Info tree.  To install Info files,
perform these steps:

  1. Move the files to the `info' directory in the installed Emacs
     distribution.  *Note File-name conventions::, if you don't know
     where that is.

  2. Run the `install-info' command, which is part of the Texinfo
     distribution, to update the main Info directory menu, like this:

           install-info --info-dir=DIR-PATH DIR-PATH/FILE

     where DIR-PATH is the full path to the directory where you copied
     the produced Info file(s), and FILE is the name of the Info file
     you produced and want to install.

     If you don't have the `install-info' command installed, you can
     edit the file `info/dir' in the installed Emacs distribution, and
     add a line for the top level node in the Info package that you are
     installing.  Follow the examples already in this file.  The format
     is:

          * Topic: (relative-pathname).  Short description of topic.


   If you want to install Info files and you don't have the necessary
privileges, you have several options:

   * Info files don't actually need to be installed before being used.
     You can feed a file name to the `Info-goto-node' command (invoked
     by pressing <g> in Info mode) by typing the name of the file in
     parentheses.  This goes to the node named "Top" in that file.  For
     example, to view a Info file named `INFO-FILE' in your home
     directory, you can type this:

          C-h i g (~/INFO-FILE) <RET>

   * You can create your own Info directory.  You can tell Emacs where
     that Info directory is by adding its pathname to the value of the
     variable `Info-default-directory-list'.  For example, to use a
     private Info directory which is a subdirectory of your home
     directory named `Info', you could put this in your `.emacs' file:

          (setq Info-default-directory-list
                (cons "~/Info" Info-default-directory-list))

     You will need a top-level Info file named `dir' in this directory
     which has everything the system `dir' file has in it, except it
     should list only entries for Info files in that directory.  You
     might not need it if all files in this directory were referenced

How do I print a Texinfo file?
==============================

   You can't get nicely printed output from Info files; you must still
have the original Texinfo source file for the manual you want to print.

   Assuming you have TeX installed on your system, follow these steps:

  1. Make sure the first line of the Texinfo file looks like this:

          \input texinfo

     You may need to change `texinfo' to the full pathname of the
     `texinfo.tex' file, which comes with Emacs as `man/texinfo.tex'
     (or copy or link it into the current directory).

  2. Type `texi2dvi TEXINFO-SOURCE', where TEXINFO-SOURCE is the name
     of the Texinfo source file for which you want to produce a printed
     copy.

     The `texi2dvi' script is part of the GNU Texinfo distribution
     (*note Installing Texinfo documentation::).

  3. Print the DVI file `TEXINFO-SOURCE.dvi' in the normal way for
     printing DVI files at your site.  For example, if you have a
     PostScript printer, run the `dvips' program to print the DVI file
     on that printer.


   To get more general instructions, retrieve the latest Texinfo package
(*note Installing Texinfo documentation::).

Can I view Info files without using Emacs?
==========================================

   Yes.  Here are some alternative programs:

   * `info', a stand-alone version of the Info program, comes as part of
     the Texinfo package.  *Note Installing Texinfo documentation::, for
     details.

   * Xinfo, a stand-alone version of the Info program that runs under X
     Window system.  You can get it at
     `ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/xinfo/xinfo-1.01.01.tar.gz' and all
     mirrors of `ftp.gnu.org' (see *Note Current GNU distributions::,
     for a list of mirrors).

   * Tkinfo, an Info viewer that runs under X Window system and uses
     Tcl/Tk.  You can get Tkinfo at
     `http://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/tkinfo/'.

Where can I get help in installing Emacs?
=========================================

   *Note Installing Emacs::, for some basic installation hints, and see
*Note Problems building Emacs::, or *Note Linking with -lX11 fails::,
if you have problems with the installation.

   The file `etc/SERVICE' (see *Note File-name conventions::, if you're
not sure where that is) lists companies and individuals willing to sell
you help in installing or using Emacs.  An up-to-date version this file
is available on `ftp.gnu.org' (*note Informational files for Emacs::).


File: efaq,  Node: Obtaining the FAQ,  Prev: Help installing Emacs,  Up: Getting help

Where can I get the latest version of this FAQ?
===============================================

   The Emacs FAQ is available in several ways:

   * Inside of Emacs itself.  You can get it from selecting the `Emacs
     FAQ' option from the `Help' menu of the Emacs menu bar at the top
     of any Emacs frame, or by typing `C-h F' (`M-x view-emacs-FAQ').

   * Via USENET.  If you can read news, the FAQ should be available in
     your news spool, in both the `news:gnu.emacs.help' and
     `news:comp.emacs' newsgroups.  Every news reader should allow you
     to read any news article that is still in the news spool, even if
     you have read the article before.  You may need to read the
     instructions for your news reader to discover how to do this.  In
     `rn', this command will do this for you at the article selection
     level:

          ?GNU Emacs Frequently Asked Questions?rc:m

     In Gnus, you should type `C-u C-x C-s' from the `*Summary*' buffer
     or `C-u <SPC>' from the `*Newsgroup*' buffer to view all articles
     in a newsgroup.

     If the FAQ articles have expired and have been deleted from your
     news spool, it might (or might not) do some good to complain to
     your news administrator, because the most recent FAQ should not
     expire for a while.

   * Via HTTP or FTP.  You can always fetch the latest FAQ from

     `http://www.lerner.co.il/emacs/' and

     `ftp://ftp.lerner.co.il/pub/emacs/'

   * In the Emacs distribution.  Since Emacs 18.56, the FAQ at the time
     of release has been part of the Emacs distribution as either
     `etc/FAQ' or `man/faq.texi' (*note File-name conventions::).

   * Via the World Wide Web.  A hypertext version is available at

     `http://www.lerner.co.il/emacs/'

   * Via anonymous ftp and e-mail from `rtfm.mit.edu' (and its mirror in
     Europe), the main repository for FAQs and other items posted to
     news.answers.  The Emacs FAQs are available at

     `ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/comp.emacs/' and

     `ftp://ftp.uni-paderborn.de/pub/doc/FAQ/comp/emacs/'

     If you do not have access to anonymous FTP, you can access the
     archives using the `rtfm.mit.edu' mail server.  The Emacs FAQ can
     be retrieved by sending mail to <mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu> with a
     blank subject and containing

          send usenet/news.answers/GNU-Emacs-FAQ/diffs

     For more information, send email to <mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu>
     with "help" and "index" in the body on separate lines.

   * As the very last resort, you can e-mail a request to
     <emacs-faq@lerner.co.il>.  Don't do this unless you have made a
     good-faith effort to obtain the FAQ list via one of the methods
     listed above.

Status of Emacs
***************

   This chapter gives you basic information about Emacs, including its
latest version status.

* Menu:

* Origin of the term Emacs::
* Latest version of Emacs::
* New in Emacs 20::
* New in Emacs 21::


File: efaq,  Node: Origin of the term Emacs,  Next: Latest version of Emacs,  Prev: Status of Emacs,  Up: Status of Emacs

Where does the name "Emacs" come from?
======================================

   Emacs originally was an acronym for Editor MACroS.  RMS says he
"picked the name Emacs because <E> was not in use as an abbreviation on
ITS at the time."  The first Emacs was a set of macros written in 1976
at MIT by RMS for the editor TECO (Text Editor and COrrector,
originally Tape Editor and COrrector) under ITS on a PDP-10.  RMS had
already extended TECO with a "real-time" full-screen mode with
reprogrammable keys.  Emacs was started by Guy Steele
<gls@east.sun.com> as a project to unify the many divergent TECO
command sets and key bindings at MIT, and completed by RMS.

   Many people have said that TECO code looks a lot like line noise; you
can read more at `news:alt.lang.teco'.  Someone has written a TECO
implementation in Emacs Lisp (to find it, see *Note Packages that do
not come with Emacs::); it would be an interesting project to run the
original TECO Emacs inside of Emacs.

   For some not-so-serious alternative reasons for Emacs to have that
name, check out the file `etc/JOKES' (*note File-name conventions::).


File: efaq,  Node: Latest version of Emacs,  Next: New in Emacs 20,  Prev: Origin of the term Emacs,  Up: Status of Emacs

What is the latest version of Emacs?
====================================

   Emacs 21.2 is the current version as of this writing.


File: efaq,  Node: New in Emacs 20,  Next: New in Emacs 21,  Prev: Latest version of Emacs,  Up: Status of Emacs

What is different about Emacs 20?
=================================

   To find out what has changed in recent versions, type `C-h n' (`M-x
view-emacs-news').  The oldest changes are at the bottom of the file,
so you might want to read it starting there, rather than at the top.

   The differences between Emacs versions 18 and 19 was rather dramatic;
the introduction of frames, faces, and colors on windowing systems was
obvious to even the most casual user.

   There are differences between Emacs versions 19 and 20 as well, but
many are more subtle or harder to find.  Among the changes are the
inclusion of MULE code for languages that use non-Latin characters and
for mixing several languages in the same document; the "Customize"
facility for modifying variables without having to use Lisp; and
automatic conversion of files from Macintosh, Microsoft, and Unix
platforms.

   A number of older Lisp packages, such as Gnus, Supercite and the
calendar/diary, have been updated and enhanced to work with Emacs 20,
and are now included with the standard distribution.


File: efaq,  Node: New in Emacs 21,  Prev: New in Emacs 20,  Up: Status of Emacs

What is different about Emacs 21?
=================================

   Emacs 21 features a thorough rewrite of the display engine.  The new
display engine supports variable-size fonts, images, and can play sounds
on platforms which support that.  As a result, the visual appearence of
Emacs, when it runs on a windowed display, is much more reminiscent of
modern GUI programs, and includes 3D widgets (used for the mode line and
the scroll bars), a configurable and extensible toolbar, tooltips
(a.k.a. balloon help), and other niceties.

   In addition, Emacs 21 supports faces on text-only terminals.  This
means that you can now have colors when you run Emacs on a GNU/Linux
console and on `xterm' with `emacs -nw'.

How do I set up a `.emacs' file properly?
=========================================

   *note Init File: (emacs)Init File

   In general, new Emacs users should not have `.emacs' files, because
it causes confusing non-standard behavior.  Then they send questions to
<help-gnu-emacs@gnu.org> asking why Emacs isn't behaving as documented.

   Beginning with version 20.1, Emacs includes the new Customize
facility, which can be invoked using `M-x customize <RET>'.  This
allows users who are unfamiliar with Emacs Lisp to modify their
`.emacs' files in a relatively straightforward way, using menus rather
than Lisp code.  Not all packages support Customize as of this writing,
but the number is growing fairly steadily.

   While Customize might indeed make it easier to configure Emacs,
consider taking a bit of time to learn Emacs Lisp and modifying your
`.emacs' directly.  Simple configuration options are described rather
completely in *note Init File: (emacs)Init File, for users interested
in performing frequently requested, basic tasks.


File: efaq,  Node: Colors on a TTY,  Next: Debugging a customization file,  Prev: Setting up a customization file,  Up: Common requests

How do I get colors and syntax highlighting on a TTY?
=====================================================

   In Emacs 21.1 and later, colors and faces are supported in
non-windowed mode, i.e. on Unix and GNU/Linux text-only terminals and
consoles, and when invoked as `emacs -nw' on X and MS-Windows.  (Colors
and faces were supported in the MS-DOS port since Emacs 19.29.)  Emacs
automatically detects color support at startup and uses it if
available.  If you think that your terminal supports colors, but Emacs
won't use them, check the `termcap' entry for your display type for
color-related capabilities.

   The command `M-x list-colors-display' pops up a window which
exhibits all the colors Emacs knows about on the current display.

   Syntax highlighting is usually turned off by default; see *Note
Turning on syntax highlighting::, for instructions how to turn it on.


File: efaq,  Node: Debugging a customization file,  Next: Displaying the current line or column,  Prev: Colors on a TTY,  Up: Common requests

How do I debug a `.emacs' file?
===============================

   Start Emacs with the `-debug-init' command-line option.  This
enables the Emacs Lisp debugger before evaluating your `.emacs' file,
and places you in the debugger if something goes wrong.  The top line
in the `trace-back' buffer will be the error message, and the second or
third line of that buffer will display the Lisp code from your `.emacs'
file that caused the problem.

   You can also evaluate an individual function or argument to a
function in your `.emacs' file by moving the cursor to the end of the
function or argument and typing `C-x C-e' (`M-x eval-last-sexp').

   Use `C-h v' (`M-x describe-variable') to check the value of
variables which you are trying to set or use.


File: efaq,  Node: Displaying the current line or column,  Next: Displaying the current file name in the titlebar,  Prev: Debugging a customization file,  Up: Common requests

How do I make Emacs display the current line (or column) number?
================================================================

   To have Emacs automatically display the current line number of the
point in the mode line, do `M-x line-number-mode'.  You can also put the
form

     (setq line-number-mode t)

in your `.emacs' file to achieve this whenever you start Emacs.  (Line
number display is on by default, unless your site-specific
initialization disables it.) Note that Emacs will not display the line
number if the buffer's size in bytes is larger than the value of the
variable `line-number-display-limit'.

   As of Emacs 20, you can similarly display the current column with
`M-x column-number-mode', or by putting the form

     (setq column-number-mode t)

in your `.emacs' file.

   The `"%c"' format specifier in the variable `mode-line-format' will
insert the current column's value into the mode line.  See the
documentation for `mode-line-format' (using `C-h v mode-line-format
<RET>') for more information on how to set and use this variable.

   Users of all Emacs versions can display the current column using the
`column' package written by Per Abrahamsen <abraham@dina.kvl.dk>.
*Note Packages that do not come with Emacs::, for instructions on how
to get it.

   None of the `vi' emulation modes provide the "set number" capability
of `vi' (as far as we know).


File: efaq,  Node: Displaying the current file name in the titlebar,  Next: Turning on abbrevs by default,  Prev: Displaying the current line or column,  Up: Common requests

How can I modify the titlebar to contain the current file name?
===============================================================

   The contents of an Emacs frame's titlebar is controlled by the
variable `frame-title-format', which has the same structure as the
variable `mode-line-format'.  (Use `C-h v' or `M-x describe-variable'
to get information about one or both of these variables.)

   By default, the titlebar for a frame does contain the name of the
buffer currently being visited, except if there is a single frame.  In
such a case, the titlebar contains Emacs invocation name and the name
of the machine at which Emacs was invoked.  This is done by setting
`frame-title-format' to the default value of

     (multiple-frames "%b" ("" invocation-name "@" system-name))

   To modify the behavior such that frame titlebars contain the buffer's
name regardless of the number of existing frames, include the following
in your `.emacs':

     (setq frame-title-format "%b")

How do I turn on abbrevs by default just in mode MYMODE?
========================================================

   Put this in your `.emacs' file:

     (condition-case ()
        (quietly-read-abbrev-file)
       (file-error nil))
     
     (add-hook 'MYMODE-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                (setq abbrev-mode t)))


File: efaq,  Node: Turning on auto-fill by default,  Next: Associating modes with files,  Prev: Turning on abbrevs by default,  Up: Common requests

How do I turn on `auto-fill-mode' by default?
=============================================

   To turn on `auto-fill-mode' just once for one buffer, use `M-x
auto-fill-mode'.

   To turn it on for every buffer in a certain mode, you must use the
hook for that mode.  For example, to turn on `auto-fill' mode for all
text buffers, including the following in your `.emacs' file:

     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)

   If you want `auto-fill' mode on in all major modes, do this:

     (setq-default auto-fill-function 'do-auto-fill)


File: efaq,  Node: Associating modes with files,  Next: Working with unprintable characters,  Prev: Turning on auto-fill by default,  Up: Common requests

How do I make Emacs use a certain major mode for certain files?
===============================================================

   If you want to use a certain mode FOO for all files whose names end
with the extension `.BAR', this will do it for you:

     (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.BAR\\'" . FOO-mode) auto-mode-alist))

   Otherwise put this somewhere in the first line of any file you want
to edit in the mode FOO (in the second line, if the first line begins
with `#!'):

     -*- FOO -*-

   Beginning with Emacs 19, the variable `interpreter-mode-alist'
specifies which mode to use when loading a shell script.  (Emacs
determines which interpreter you're using by examining the first line of
the script.)  This feature only applies when the file name doesn't
indicate which mode to use.  Use `C-h v' (or `M-x describe-variable')
on `interpreter-mode-alist' to learn more.


File: efaq,  Node: Working with unprintable characters,  Next: Highlighting a region,  Prev: Associating modes with files,  Up: Common requests

How do I search for, delete, or replace unprintable (eight-bit or control) characters?
======================================================================================

   To search for a single character that appears in the buffer as, for
example, `\237', you can type `C-s C-q 2 3 7'.  (This assumes the value
of `search-quote-char' is 17 (i.e., `C-q').)  Searching for *all*
unprintable characters is best done with a regular expression
("regexp") search.  The easiest regexp to use for the unprintable chars
is the complement of the regexp for the printable chars.

   * Regexp for the printable chars: `[\t\n\r\f -~]'

   * Regexp for the unprintable chars: `[^\t\n\r\f -~]'


   To type these special characters in an interactive argument to
`isearch-forward-regexp' or `re-search-forward', you need to use `C-q'.
(`\t', `\n', `\r', and `\f' stand respectively for <TAB>, <LFD>,
<RET>, and `C-l'.)  So, to search for unprintable characters using
`re-search-forward':

   `M-x re-search-forward <RET> [^ <TAB> C-q <LFD> C-q <RET> C-q C-l
<SPC> -~] <RET>'

   Using `isearch-forward-regexp':

   `M-C-s [^ <TAB> <LFD> C-q <RET> C-q C-l <SPC> -~]'

   To delete all unprintable characters, simply use replace-regexp:

   `M-x replace-regexp <RET> [^ <TAB> C-q <LFD> C-q <RET> C-q C-l <SPC>
-~] <RET> <RET>'

   Replacing is similar to the above.  To replace all unprintable
characters with a colon, use:

   M-x replace-regexp <RET> [^ <TAB> C-q <LFD> C-q <RET> C-q C-l <SPC>
-~] <RET> : <RET>

   * You don't need to quote <TAB> with either isearch or typing
     something in the minibuffer.



File: efaq,  Node: Highlighting a region,  Next: Controlling case sensitivity,  Prev: Working with unprintable characters,  Up: Common requests

How can I highlight a region of text in Emacs?
==============================================

   You can cause the region to be highlighted when the mark is active by
including

     (transient-mark-mode t)

in your `.emacs' file.  (Also see *Note Turning on syntax
highlighting::.)


File: efaq,  Node: Controlling case sensitivity,  Next: Wrapping words automatically,  Prev: Highlighting a region,  Up: Common requests

How do I control Emacs's case-sensitivity when searching/replacing?
===================================================================

   For searching, the value of the variable `case-fold-search'
determines whether they are case sensitive:

     (setq case-fold-search nil) ; make searches case sensitive
     (setq case-fold-search t)   ; make searches case insensitive

   Similarly, for replacing, the variable `case-replace' determines
whether replacements preserve case.

   To change the case sensitivity just for one major mode, use the major
mode's hook.  For example:

     (add-hook 'FOO-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                (setq case-fold-search nil)))
