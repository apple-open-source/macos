added features to many parts of Emacs.  (Many are mentioned in the
`ChangeLog' files which are summarized in the file `AUTHORS' in the
distribution.)  We thank them for their generosity as well.

   This list intended to mention every contributor of a major package or
feature we currently distribute; if you know of someone we have omitted,
please report that as a manual bug.
