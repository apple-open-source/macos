Overview
********

   The Emacs mode for programming in Ada 95 with GNAT helps the user in
understanding existing code and facilitates writing new code.  It
furthermore provides some utility functions for easier integration of
standard Emacs features when programming in Ada.

General features:
=================

   * full Integrated Development Environment:
        * support of "project files" for the configuration (directories,
          compilation options,...)

        * compiling and stepping through error messages.

        * running and debugging your applications within Emacs.

   * easy to use for beginners by pull-down menus,

   * user configurable by many user-option variables.

Ada mode features that help understanding code:
===============================================

   * functions for easy and quick stepping through Ada code,

   * getting cross reference information for identifiers (e.g. find the
     defining place by a keystroke),

   * displaying an index menu of types and subprograms and move point to
     the chosen one,

   * automatic color highlighting of the various entities in Ada code.

Emacs support for writing Ada code:
===================================

   * switching between spec and body files with eventually
     auto-generation of body files,

   * automatic formating of subprograms parameter lists.

   * automatic smart indentation according to Ada syntax,

   * automatic completion of identifiers,

   * automatic casing of identifiers, keywords, and attributes,

   * insertion of statement templates,

   * filling comment paragraphs like filling normal text,

Installation
************

   If you  got Ada mode as  a separate distribution, you  should have a
look at the  `README' file.  It explains the  basic steps necessary for
a good installation of the emacs Ada mode.

   Installing the  Ada mode  is basically  just a matter  of copying  a
few files into  the Emacs  library directories. Every  time you open  a
file with  a  file  extension  of  `.ads'  or  `.adb',  Emacs  will
automatically load and activate Ada mode.

   *Note Using non-standard file names::, if your  files do not use
these extensions and if you want Emacs to automatically start the Ada
mode every time you edit an Ada file.

   See also the Emacs Manual (*note (Top: (emacs)(Top.), for general
usage variables that you might want to set.

Required files
==============

   This Ada  mode works best  with Emacs 20.3  or higher (the  easy
editing features for the  project files won't work with  any older
version), but most of the commands should work  with older versions
too. Please try to install  the  most  recent  version  of  Emacs  on
your  system  before installing Ada mode.

   Although part of Ada mode is compiler-independent, the most advanced
features are specific to the Gnat compiler <http://www.gnat.com>.

   The following files are provided with the Ada mode distribution:

   * `ada-mode.el': The main file for Ada mode.  This  is the  only
     file  which does  not require  Gnat. It  contains the functions
     for  indentation,  formatting  of parameter  lists,  stepping
     through  code, comment  handling and  automatic casing.   Emacs
     versions 20.2 and higher already contain Ada mode version 2.27,
     which is an older version of this file  and should be replaced.
     Loading `ada-mode.el' from the current distribution supersedes the
     standard installation.

   * `ada-stmt.el': Contains the statement templates feature.

   * `ada-xref.el': This file provides the main support for Gnat.  This
     is  where  the   functions  for  cross-references,  completion  of
     identifiers,  support   for  project  files  and   compilation  of
     your application are defined.

   * `ada-prj.el': The functions to use for easy-edition of the project
     files.  This file is the only one which really requires Emacs at
     least 20.2. It uses the new widget features from Emacs.

Customizing Ada mode
********************

   Ada mode is  fully customizable. Everything, from the  file names to
the automatic  indentation and  the automatic casing  can be  adapted to
your own needs.

   There  are   two  different  kinds   of  variables  that   control
this customization, both are easy to modify.

   The first set of variables are standard Emacs variables. Of course,
some are defined  only for Ada  mode, whereas others have  a more
general meaning  in   Emacs.  Please  see  the  Emacs   documentation
for  more information on the latest. In this documentation, we will
detail all the variables that are specific to Ada mode, and a few
others. The names will be given, as in `ada-case-identifier'.

   Emacs provides an easy way to modify them, through a special mode
called customization.    To    access    this    mode,    select    the
  menu `Ada->Customize'.  This will open a new buffer with some fields
that you can edit.  For instance, you will get something like:
     Put below the compiler switches.
     comp_opt= _____________________________________
   The first  line gives a brief  description of the  variable.  The
second line is  the name of  the variable  and the field  where you can
give a value for this variable. Simply type what you want in the field.

   When you are  finished modifying the variables, you  can simply
click on the Save for future sessions button  at the top of the buffer
(click with  the  middle mouse  button).  This will  save  the  values
in  your `.emacs' file, so that next time you start Emacs they will
have the same values.

   To modify a specific variable, you can directly call the function
`customize-variable' from Emacs (just type `M-x customize-variable
<RET> VARIABLE-NAME <RET>').

   Some users might prefer to modify the variables directly in their
configuration file, `.emacs'. This file is coded in Emacs lisp, and the
syntax to set a variable is the following:
     (setq variable-name value)

   The second set of variables for customization are set through the
use of project files. These variables are  specific to a given project,
whereas the  first   set  was  more   general.  For  more
information,  please *Note Project files::.

Project files
*************

General overview
================

   Emacs provides a full Integrated Development Environment for GNAT and
Ada programmers. That is to say, editing, compiling, executing and
debugging can be performed within Emacs in a convenient and natural way.

   To take full advantage of this features, it is possible to create a
file in  the main  directory of  your application,  with a  `.adp'
extension.  This  file contain  all needed  information  dealing with
the way  your application is  organized between directories, the
commands to compile, run and debug it etc. Creating this file is not
mandatory and convenient defaults are  automatically provided for
simple setups.  It only becomes necessary when those above mentioned
defaults need customizing.

   A simple way to edit this file is provided for Emacs 20.2 or newer,
with the  following functions,  that  you  can access  also  through
the  Ada menu. It  is also possible  to edit the  project file as a
regular text file.

   Once  in the  buffer for  editing the  project file,  you can  save
your modification using  the `[OK]'  button at the  bottom of the
buffer, or simply   use  the  usual   `C-x  C-s'   binding.   To
cancel  your modifications, simply kill the buffer  or click on the
`[CANCEL]' button at the button.

   Each buffer using Ada mode will be associated with one project file
when there  is one  available,  so  that Emacs  can  easily navigate
through related source files for instance.

   The exact algorithm to determine which project file should be used is
described in the next section, but you can force the project file you
want to use by setting one or two variables in your `.emacs' file.

   * To set up a default project file to use for any directory, anywhere
     on your system, set the variable `ada-prj-default-project-file' to
     the name of that file.

          (set 'ada-prj-default-project-file "/dir1/dir2/file")

   * For finer control, you can set a per-directory project file.  This
     is done through the variable `ada-xref-default-prj-file'.

            (set 'ada-xref-default-prj-file
                 '(("/dir1/dir2" . "/dir3/file1")
                   ("/dir4/dir5" . "/dir6/file2")))

     Note: This has a higher priority than the first variable, so the
     first choice is to use this variable settings, and otherwise
     `ada-prj-default-project-file'.

`C-c u'
     Create or edit the project file for the current buffer
     (`ada-customize').

`C-c c'
     Change the project file associated with the current Ada buffer
     (`ada-change-prj').

`C-c d'
     Change the  default project  file for the  current directory
     (`ada-change-default-project').  Every new file opened  from this
     directory will be  associated with that  file by default.

`ada-set-default-project-file'
     Set the default  project file to use for *any*  Ada file opened
     anywhere on your system. This sets this file only for the current
     Emacs session.

Project file variables
======================

   The following variables can be defined in a project file.  They all
have a default value, so that small  projects do not need to create a
project file.

   Some  variables below  can be  referenced  in other  variables,
using  a shell-like  notation.   For instance,  if  the variable
`comp_cmd' contains a sequence like `${comp_opt}', the value of that
variable will be substituted.

   Here is the list of variables:

`src_dir'          [default: `"./"']
     This is  a list of directories where Ada mode will  look for source
     files. These directories are used mainly  in two cases, both as a
     switch for the compiler and for the cross-references.

`obj_dir'             [default: `"./"']
     This is a list of directories where to look for object and library
     files.  The library files are the `.ali' files generated by Gnat
     and that contain cross-reference informations.

`comp_opt'            [default: `""']
     Creates a  variable which can be  referred to subsequently  by
     using the `${comp_opt}' notation.   This is  intended to store
     the default switches given to `gnatmake' and `gcc'.

`bind_opt=SWITCHES'   [default: `""']
     Creates a  variable which can be  referred to subsequently  by
     using the `${bind_opt}' notation.   This is  intended to store
     the default switches given to `gnatbind'.

`link_opt=SWITCHES'   [default: `""']
     Creates a  variable which can be  referred to subsequently  by
     using the `${link_opt}' notation.   This is  intended to store
     the default switches given to `gnatlink'.

`main=EXECUTABLE'     [default: `""']
     Specifies the name of the  executable for the application. This
     variable can be referred to in  the following lines by using the
     `${main}' notation.

`cross_prefix=PREFIX' [default: `""']
     This variable  should be set if  you are working  in a
     cross-compilation environment. This is the prefix used in front of
     the gnatmake commands.

`remote_machine=MACHINE' [default: `""']
     This is the name of the machine to log into before issuing the
     compilation command. If this variable is empty, the command will be
     run on the local machine. This will not work on Windows NT
     machines, since Ada mode will simply precede the compilation
     command with a `rsh' command, unknown on Windows.

`comp_cmd=COMMAND'    [default: `"${cross_prefix}gcc -c -I${src_dir} -g -gnatq"']
     Specifies the command used to compile a single file in the
     application.  The name of the file will be added at the end of
     this command.

`make_cmd=COMMAND'    [default: `"${cross_prefix}gnatmake ${main} -aI${src_dir} -aO${obj_dir} -g -gnatq -cargs ${comp_opt} -bargs ${bind_opt} -largs ${link_opt}"]''
     Specifies the command used to recompile the whole application.

`run_cmd=COMMAND'     [default: `"${main}"']
     Specifies the command used to run the application.

`debug_cmd=COMMAND'   [default: `"${cross_prefix}gdb ${main}"']
     Specifies the command used to debug the application

Detailed algorithm
==================

   This section gives more details on the project file setup and is
only of interest for advanced users.

   Usually, an Ada file is part  of a larger application, whose sources
and objects can be spread over multiple directories. The first time
emacs is asked to compile, run or debug an application, or when a cross
reference function is  used (goto declaration  for instance), the
following steps are taken:

   * find the appropriate project file, open and parse it.  All  the
     fields  read  in the  project  file are  then  stored by  emacs
     locally.  Finding the project file requires a few steps:

        - if a file from the same directory was already associated with
          a project file, use the same one. This is the variable
          `ada-xref-default-prj-file' described above.

        - if the variable `ada-prj-default-project-file' is set, use
          the project file specified in this variable.

        - if there is a project file whose name is the same as the
          source file except for the suffix, use this one.

        - if  there's only one project file in the source directory, use
          that one.

        - if there are more than one project file in the source
          directory, ask the user.

        - if there are no project files in the source directory use
          standard default values.

     The first project file that is selected in a given directory
     becomes the default project file for this directory and is used
     implicitly for other sources unless specified otherwise by the
     user.

   * look for the corresponding `.ali' file in the `obj_dir' defined in
     the project  file.  If this file can not be  found, emacs proposes
     to compile the source using the `comp_cmd' defined in the project
     file in order to create the ali file.

   * when cross referencing is requested, the `.ali'  file is parsed to
     determine  the  file and  line  of  the  identifier definition.
     It  is possible for  the `.ali' file to be  older than the source
     file, in which case it will be recompiled if the variable
     `ada-xref-create-ali' is set, otherwise the  reference is searched
     in the  obsolete ali file with possible inaccurate results.

   * look  for   the file containing the declaration using the source
     path `src_dir' defined in the  project file.  Put the cursor at the
     correct position and display this new cursor.

Syntax highlighting
*******************

   Ada mode is made to help you understand the structure of your source
files. Some  people like having  colors or different fonts  depending on
the  context: commands  should be  displayed differently  than keywords,
which should also be different from strings, ...

   Emacs is able to display in a different way the following syntactic
entities:

   * keywords

   * commands

   * strings

   * gnatprep statements (preprocessor)

   * types (under certain conditions)

   * other words

   This  is not  the default  behavior for  Emacs. You  have  to
explicitly activate it. This requires that you add a new line in your
`.emacs' file (if this file does not exist, just create it).

     (global-font-lock-mode t)

   But  the default colors  might not  be the  ones you  like.
Fortunately, there  is  a  very  easy  way  to change  them.  Just
select  the  menu `Help->Customize->Specific  Face...'  and  press
<RET>.  This will display a buffer will all the "faces" (the colors)
that Emacs knows about. You can change any of them.


File: ada-mode,  Node: Moving Through Ada Code,  Next: Identifier completion,  Prev: Syntax highlighting,  Up: Top

Moving Through Ada Code
***********************

   There are several  easy to use commands to stroll  through Ada code.
All these functions are available through the Ada menu, and you can
also use the following key bindings or the command names:

`M-C-e'
     Move to the next function/procedure/task, which ever comes next
     (`ada-next-procedure').

`M-C-a'
     Move to previous function/procedure/task
     (`ada-previous-procedure').

`M-x ada-next-package'
     Move to next package.

`M-x ada-prev-package'
     Move to previous package.

`C-c C-a'
     Move to matching start of `end' (`ada-move-to-start').  If point
     is at the end of a subprogram, this command jumps to the
     corresponding `begin' if the user option `ada-move-to-declaration'
     is `nil' (default), it jumps to the subprogram declaration
     otherwise.

`C-c C-e'
     Move point to end of current block (`ada-move-to-end').

`C-c o'
     Switch between corresponding spec and body file
     (`ff-find-other-file').  If the cursor is on a subprogram, switch
     between declaration and body.

`C-c c-d'
     Move  from   any  reference  to  its  declaration   and  switch
     between declaration  and body  (for  procedures, tasks,  private
     and  incomplete types).

`C-c C-r'
     runs the `gnatfind' command to search for all references to the
     entity pointed by the cursor (`ada-find-references').  Use `C-x `'
     (`next-error') to visit each reference (as for compilation errors).

   These  functions use  the  information in  the  output of  the Gnat
Ada compiler.   However,   if  your   application  was  compiled   with
the `-gnatx'  switch, these  functions will  not work,  since  no extra
information  is generated by  GNAT. See  GNAT documentation  for further
information.

   Emacs will  try to  run    Gnat for  you whenever the
cross-reference informations  are     older   than your   source   file
 (provided  the `ada-xref-create-ali' variable is  non-`nil').  Gnat
then produces a file with the same name  as the current  Ada file but
with the extension changed to `.ali'. This files are normally used  by
the binder, but they will also contain additional cross-referencing
information.

Identifier completion
*********************

Overview
========

   Emacs and  Ada mode provide  two general ways for  the completion of
identifiers. This is  an easy way to type faster: you  just have to type
the first few  letters of an identifiers, and then  loop through all the
possible completions.

   The  first method  is general  for  Emacs. It  will work  both with
Ada buffers, but also in C buffers,  Java buffers, ....  The idea is to
parse all the opened buffers for possible completions.

   For instance, if the words `my_identifier', `my_subprogram' are the
only words starting with `my' in any of the opened files, then you will
have this scenario:

     You type:  my<M-/> Emacs inserts:  `my_identifier' If you press
     <M-/> once again, Emacs replaces `my_identifier' with
     `my_subprogram'.  Pressing <M-/> once more will bring you back to
     `my_identifier'.

   This is a very  fast way to do completion, and the  casing of words
will also be respected.

   The second  method is specific to Ada  buffer, and even to  users of
the Gnat compiler. Emacs will search the cross-information found in the
`.ali' files generated by Gnat for possible completions.

   The  main advantage  is  that  this completion  is  more accurate:
only existing identifier  will be  suggested, you don't  need to have
a file opened that already contains this identifiers, ....

   On the other  hand, this completion is a little  bit slower and
requires that you  have compiled your file  at least once since  you
created that identifier.

Summary of commands
===================

`C-<TAB>'
     Complete accurately current identifier using information in `.ali'
     file (`ada-complete-identifier').

`M-/'
     Complete identifier using buffer information (not Ada-specific).

Index Menu of Subprograms
*************************

   You  can   display  a  choice  menu   with  all
procedure/function/task declarations in the file and choose an item by
mouse click to get to its declaration.  This function is  accessible
through  the `Ada' menu when editing a Ada file, or simply through the
following key binding:

`C-S-Mouse-3'
     display index menu


File: ada-mode,  Node: File Browser,  Next: Automatic Smart Indentation,  Prev: Index Menu of Subprograms,  Up: Top

File Browser
************

   Emacs provides a special mode, called `speedbar'. When this mode is
activated, a new frame is displayed, with a file browser. The files from
the current  directory are displayed, and  you can click on  them as you
would with any file browser. The following commands are then available.

   You can click  on a directory name  or file name to open  it. The
editor will  automatically  select  the  best  possible  mode  for
this  file, including of course Ada mode for files written in Ada.

   If you click on the `[+]' symbol near a file name, all the symbols
(types, variables and subprograms)  defined in that file will  be
displayed, and you  can directly click  on them  to open  the right
file at  the right place.

   You can activate  this mode by typing <M-x  speedbar> in the editor.
This  will open  a new  frame. A  better way  might be  to  assicate the
following key binding

     (global-set-key [f7]  'speedbar-get-focus)

   Every time you press <F7>,  the mouse will automatically move to the
speedbar frame (which will be created if it does not exist).


File: ada-mode,  Node: Automatic Smart Indentation,  Next: Formatting Parameter Lists,  Prev: File Browser,  Up: Top

Automatic Smart Indentation
***************************

   Ada mode  comes with a full set of  rules for automatic indentation.
You can of course configure the  indentation as you want, by setting the
value of a few variables.

   As  always,  the  preferred  way  to  modify variables  is  to  use
the `Ada->Customize' menu  (don't forget  to save your  changes!). This
will also show you some example of code where this variable is used, and
hopefully make things clearer.

   The relevant variables are the following:

`ada-broken-indent'           (default value: 2)
     Number of columns to indent the continuation of a broken line.

`ada-indent'                  (default value: 3)
     Width of the default indentation.

`ada-indent-record-rel-type'  (default value: 3)
     Indentation for `record' relative to `type' or `use'.

`ada-indent-return'           (default value: 0)
     Indentation for `return' relative to `function' (if
     `ada-indent-return' is greater than 0), or the open parenthesis
     (if `ada-indent-return' is negative or null).  Note that in the
     second case, when there is no open parenthesis, the indentation is
     done relative to `function' with the value of `ada-broken-indent'.

`ada-label-indent'            (default value: -4)
     Number of columns to indent a label.

`ada-stmt-end-indent'         (default value: 0)
     Number of columns to indent a statement `end' keyword on a
     separate line.

`ada-when-indent'             (default value: 3)
     Indentation for `when' relative to `exception' or `case'.

`ada-indent-is-separate'      (default value: t)
     Non-`nil' means indent `is separate' or `is abstract' if on a
     single line.

`ada-indent-to-open-paren'    (default value: t)
     Non-`nil' means indent according to the innermost open parenthesis.

`ada-indent-after-return'     (default  value: t)
     Non-`nil'  means that  the current  line will  also be
     re-indented before inserting a newline, when you press <RET>.

   Most of the  time, the indentation will be automatic,  i.e when you
will press <RET>,  the cursor will move  to the correct  column on the
next line.

   However, you might want or  need sometimes to re-indent the current
line or a set of  lines. For this, you can simply go  to that line, or
select the lines,  and then press <TAB>. This  will automatically
re-indent the lines.

   Another mode of indentation exists that helps you to set up your
indentation scheme. If you press `C-c <TAB>', Ada mode will do the
following:

   * Reindent the current line, as <TAB> would do.

   * Temporarily move the cursor to a reference line, i.e., the line
     that was used to calculate the current indentation.

   * Display at the bottom of the window the name of the variable that
     provided the offset for the indentation.

   The exact indentation of the current line is the same as the one for
the reference line, plus an offset given by the variable.

   Once you know the name of the variable, you can either modify it
through the usual `Ada->Customize' menu, or by typing `M-x
customize-variable <RET>' in the Emacs window, and then give the name
of the variable.

`<TAB>'
     Indent the current line or the current region.

`M-C-\'
     Indent lines in the current selected block.

`C-c <TAB>'
     Indent the current line and prints the name of the variable used
     for indentation.

Formatting Parameter Lists
**************************

   To help you correctly align fields in a subprogram parameter list,
Emacs provides one function that will do most of the work for you.
This function will align the declarations on the colon (`:') separating
argument names and argument types, plus align the `in', `out' and `in
out' keywords if required.

`C-c C-f'
     Format the parameter list (`ada-format-paramlist').


File: ada-mode,  Node: Automatic Casing,  Next: Statement Templates,  Prev: Formatting Parameter Lists,  Up: Top

Automatic Casing
****************

   Casing  of   identifiers,  attributes  and   keywords  is
automatically performed while  typing when  the variable
`ada-auto-case'  is set.  Every  time   you  press  a   word
separator,  the  previous   word  is automatically cased.

   You  can  customize  the  automatic  casing  differently  for
keywords, attributes and  identifiers. The  relevant variables are  the
following: `ada-case-keyword',          `ada-case-attribute'
and `ada-case-identifier'.

   All these variables can have one of the following values:

`downcase-word'
     The  previous word  will simply  be in  all lower  cases.   For
     instance `My_vARIable' is converted to `my_variable'.

`upcase-word'
     The previous word will be  fully converted to upper cases.  For
     instance `My_vARIable' is converted to `MY_VARIABLE'.

`ada-capitalize-word'
     All letters, except the first one of the word and every letter
     after the `_'  character are  lower cased.  Other  letters are
     upper cased.   For instance `My_vARIable' is converted to
     `My_Variable'.

`ada-loose-case-word'
     No letters is  modified in the previous word, except  the ones
     after the `_' character that are  upper cased.  For instance
     `My_vARIable' is converted to `My_VARIable'.

   These  functions, although they  will work  in most  cases, will
not be accurate sometimes. The  Ada mode allows you to  define some
exceptions, that will always be cased the same way.

   The idea  is to  create a dictionary  of exceptions,  and store it
in a file. This file should contain  one identifier per line, with the
casing you   want   to   force.   The   default   name   for   this
file   is `~/.emacs_case_exceptions'.  You can  of course  change  this
name, through the variable `ada-case-exception-file'.

   Note that  each line  in this file  must start  with the key  word
whose casing  you want  to  specify. The  rest of  the  line can  be
used  for comments  (explaining  for  instance  what  an  abbreviation
means,  as recommended in the Ada 95  Quality and Style, paragraph
3.1.4).  Thus, a good example for this file could be:

     DOD        Department of Defense
     Text_IO
     GNAT       The GNAT compiler from Ada Core Technologies

   When  working on  project involving  multiple programmers,  we
recommend that every  member of  the team  sets this variable  to the
same value, which  should  point  to  a  system-wide  file that  each
of  them  can write.  That  way,  you  will  ensure  that  the  casing
is  consistent throughout your application(s).

   There are two ways to add new items to this file: you can simply
edit it as you  would edit any  text file, and  add or suppress entries
in this file.  Remember that  you should  put one  entity per  line.
The other, easier way, is to position the cursor  over the word you
want to add, in an Ada buffer.  This word should have the casing  you
want.  Then simply select  the  menu `Ada->Edit->Create  Case
Exception',  or the  key `C-c C-y' (`ada-create-case-exception'). The
word will automatically be added to the current list of exceptions and
to the file.

   It  is sometimes  useful to  have multiple  exception files  around
(for instance,  one could  be  the  standard Ada  acronyms,  the second
some company  specific exceptions,  and the  last one  some  project
specific exceptions).  If you  set up the variable
`ada-case-exception-file' as a list of  files, each of them will be
parsed  and used in your emacs session.

   However, when  you save a new  exception through the  menu, as
described above, the  new exception will  be added to  the first file
in  the list only.  You  can not automatically add  an exception to one
of the other files, although you can of course edit the files by hand
at any time.

   Automatic casing can be performed on port or whole buffer using:

`C-c C-b'
     Adjust case in the whole buffer (`ada-adjust-case-buffer').

`C-c C-y'
     Create a new entry in the exception dictionary, with the word under
     the cursor (`ada-create-case-exception')

`C-c C-t'
     Rereads the exception dictionary from the file
     `ada-case-exception-file' (`ada-case-read-exceptions').

Compiling Executing
*******************

   Ada mode  provides a much complete environment  for compiling,
debugging and running an application within Emacs.

   All the  commands used  by Emacs to  manipulate your application
can be customized in  the project file.  Some default values are
provided, but these will  likely not  be good  enough for a  big or
even medium-sized project.  See the section on the  project file for an
explanation on how to set up the commands to use.

   One   of   the  variables   you   can   set   in  your   project
file, `cross_prefix', indicates whether you are using a
cross-compilation environment, and if  yes for which target. The
default command used for compilation  will add  this `cross_prefix'  in
front  of  the name: `gcc'  will become  `cross_prefix'-`gcc',
`gnatmake' will become `cross_prefix'-`gnatmake', ....

   This  will also modify  the way  your application  is run  and
debugged, although this is not implemented at the moment.

   Here are the commands for building and using an Ada application

   * Compiling the current source This command is issued when  issuing
     the `compile' command from the Ada  menu. It  compiles
     unconditionally the  current  source using  the `comp_cmd'
     variable of the project file. Compilation options can be
     customized with the variable `comp_opt' of the project file.

     Emacs  will  display  a new  buffer  that  contains  the result
     of  the compilation.  Each line associated with an error will
     become active: you can simply click on it with the  middle button
     of the mouse, or move the cursor  on  it and  press  <RET>.  Emacs
     will then  display  the relevant source file and put the cursor
     on the line and column the error was found at.

     You can also simply press the `C-x `' key and Emacs will jump to
     the first error. If you press that key again, it will move you to
     the second error, and so on.

     Some error messages might also include references to some files.
     These references are also clickable in the same way.

   * (Re)building the whole application This command is issued when you
     select the `build' command from the Ada menu.   It compiles  all
     obsolete units  of the  current application using  the `make_cmd'
     variable  of the  project file.  Compilation options  can be
     customized  with the  variable  `comp_opt' of  the project  file,
     binder  options with  `bind_opt' and  linker options with
     `link_opt'. The main unit  of the application may be specified
     with `main'.

     The compilation buffer is also active in the same way it was for
     the above command.

   * Running the application This command is  issued when you select
     the  `run' command from the Ada   menu.   It   executes  the
     current  application   in   an  emacs buffer. Arguments can be
     passed through before executing. The execution buffer allows for
     interactive input/output.

     This   command   is   not   yet   available   in   a
     cross-compilation toolchain. Emacs  would first need to  log on
     the  target before running the application. This will be
     implemented in a future release of Gnat.

Debugging your application
**************************

   You  can set  up in  the project  file a  command to  use to  debug
your application. Emacs is compatible with a lot of debuggers, and
provide an easy interface to them.

   This selection will focus on the  gdb debugger, and two of the
graphical interfaces that exist for it.

   In all  cases, the main  window in  Emacs will be  split in two:  in
the upper  buffer,  the  source  code  will  appear,  whereas  the
debugger input/output  window is  displayed at  the  bottom.  You  can
enter  the debugger  commands as  usual in  the command  window. Every
time  a new source file is  selected by the debugger (for instance as
a result of a `frame' command),  the appropriate source file is
displayed in the upper buffer.

   The source window is interactive: you can click on an identifier
with the right mouse button, and print its value in the debugger
window. You can also set a breakpoint simply by right-clicking on a
line.

   You  can easily use  Emacs as  the source  window when  you are
using a graphical  interface for the  debugger. The  interesting thing
is that, whereas  you still  have the  graphical nifties,  you can
also  you the cross-references  features that  Ada mode  provides to
look  at the definition for the identifiers, ....

   Here is how you  can set up gdbtk and ddd for  use with Emacs (These
are the commands you should setup in the project file):

   * gdbtk should  be used  with  the  switch `--emacs_gdbtk'.   It
     provides a  nice backtrace window, as well as a tasks window. You
     can click interactively on both of  them, and Emacs will display
     the source  file on the correct line.

   * ddd (Data Display Debugger) should be used with the switches
     `--tty' and `--fullname'. Whenever you print a variable from
     Emacs, it will be displayed graphically in the data window.



File: ada-mode,  Node: Using non-standard file names,  Next: Working Remotely,  Prev: Debugging,  Up: Top

Using non-standard file names
*****************************

   By default, Emacs is configured to  use the GNAT style file names,
where file names are the package names,  and the extension for spec and
bodies are respectively `.ads' and `.adb'.

   If you  want to  use other  types of file  names, you will need to
modify your `.emacs' file.

   Adding new possible extensions is easy. Since Ada mode needs to know
how to  go from  the body  to the spec  (and back),  you always  have to
specify  both. A  function  is provided  with  Ada mode  to add  new
extensions.

   For instance, if your spec and bodies files are called `UNIT_s.ada'
and `UNIT_b.ada', respectively, you need to add the following to your
`.emacs' file:

     (ada-add-extensions "_s.ada" "_b.ada")

   Note that it is possible to redefine the extension, even if they
already exist, as in:

     (ada-add-extensions ".ads" "_b.ada")
     (ada-add-extensions ".ads" ".body")

   This simply means that whenever the  ada-mode will look for the body
for a file whose extension is  `.ads', it will take the first available
file  that ends  with  either `.adb'  (standard), `_b.ada'  or `.body'.

   If the filename is not the unit name, then things are a little more
complicated.  You then need to rewrite the function
`ada-make-filename-from-adaname' (see the file `ada-mode.el' for an
example).

Working Remotely
****************

   When  you work  on project  that  involve a  lot of  programmers, it
is generally the case that you will edit the files on your own
machine, but you want to compile, run and debug your application in
another buffer.

   Fortunately, here too Emacs provides a very convenient way to do
this.

Remote editing
==============

   First of  all, the files do  not need to  be on your machine.  Emacs
can edit any  remote file,  by doing transparent  FTP sessions  between
your machine and the remote machine that stores your files. This is a
special Emacs mode, called `ange-ftp'. To use it, you just have to use a
slightly different syntax when you open a file.

   For instance, if you want to  open the file `/work/foo.adb' on the
machine aleph.gnu.org, where you log in as qwe, you would simply do
this:

     C-x C-f /qwe@aleph.gnu.org:/work/foo.adb <RET>

i.e., use your name, the name of the machine and the name of the file.

   The first time, Emacs will ask  you for a password that it will
remember until you  close the current Emacs.  Even if the ftp  session
times out, you won't need to reenter your password.

   Every time you save the file, Emacs will upload it to the remote
machine transparently. No file is modified on the local machine.

Remote compiling
================

   If the  machine you  want to  compile on is  not the  one your
Emacs is running  on,  you can  set  the  variable  `remote_machine' in
the project file for your application.

   This  will force  Emacs  to issue  a  `rsh' command  for the
compilation, instead of  running it on  the local machine.
Unfortunately,  this won't work on Windows workstations, since this
protocol is not supported.

     If  your   `remote_machine'  is  aleph.gnu.org   and  the  standard
     compilation command is `cd /work/ && gnatmake foo', then Emacs will
     actually  issue  the  command  `rsh  aleph.gnu.org  'cd  /work/  &&
     gnatmake foo''.

   The advantage of using the  `remote_machine' variable is that it is
easier to change  that machine without having to  modify the compilation
command.

   Note that if you need to set up some environment variables before the
compilation, you need to insert a call to the appropriate initialization
script in the compilation command, for instance:

     build_cmd= initialization_script; cd /work/ && gnatmake foo

Remote running and debugging
============================

   This feature is not completely implemented yet.

   However, most of the time, you will be able to run your application
remotely simply by replacing it with a `rsh' call.  For instance, if
your command was `${main}', you could replace it with `rsh
aleph.gnu.org ${main}'.

   However, this would not work on vxworks, for instance, where `rsh'
is not supported.
