About PCL-CVS
*************

   PCL-CVS is a front-end to CVS versions 1.9 and later.  It concisely
shows the present status of a checked out module in an Emacs buffer and
provides single-key access to the most frequently used CVS commands.
For Emacs users accustomed to VC, PCL-CVS can be thought of as a
replacement for VC-dired (*note Dired under VC: (emacs)VC Dired Mode.)
specifically designed for CVS.

   PCL-CVS was originally written many years ago by Per Cederqvist who
proudly maintained it until January 1996, at which point he released the
beta version 2.0b2 and passed on the maintainership to Greg A Woods.
Development stayed mostly dormant for a few years during which version
2.0 never seemed to be able to leave the "beta" stage while a separate
XEmacs version was slowly splitting away.  In late 1998, Stefan Monnier
picked up development again, adding some major new functionality and
taking over the maintenance.

   As of Emacs 21, PCL-CVS is part of the standard Emacs distribution.

Contributors to PCL-CVS
=======================

   Contributions to the package are welcome.  I have limited time to
work on this project, but I will gladly add any code that you
contribute to me to this package (*note Bugs::).

   The following persons have made contributions to PCL-CVS.

   * Brian Berliner wrote CVS, together with some other contributors.
     Without his work on CVS this package would be useless...

   * Per Cederqvist wrote most of the otherwise unattributed functions
     in PCL-CVS as well as all the documentation.

   * Inge Wallin <inge@lysator.liu.se> wrote the skeleton of
     `pcl-cvs.texi', and gave useful comments on it.  He also wrote the
     files `elib-node.el' and `compile-all.el'.  The file `cookie.el'
     was inspired by Inge.

   * Linus Tolke <linus@lysator.liu.se> contributed useful comments on
     both the functionality and the documentation.

   * Jamie Zawinski <jwz@jwz.com> contributed `pcl-cvs-lucid.el', which
     was later renamed to `pcl-cvs-xemacs.el'.

   * Leif Lonnblad contributed RCVS support (since superceded by the new
     remote CVS support).

   * Jim Blandy <jimb@cyclic.com> contributed hooks to automatically
     guess CVS log entries from `ChangeLog' contents, and initial
     support of the new Cygnus / Cyclic remote CVS, as well as various
     sundry bug fixes and cleanups.

   * Jim Kingdon <kingdon@cyclic.com> contributed lots of fixes to the
     build and installation procedure.

   * Greg A. Woods <woods@weird.com> contributed code to implement the
     use of per-file diff buffers, and vendor join diffs with emerge and
     ediff, as well as various and sundry bug fixes and cleanups.

   * Greg Klanderman <greg.klanderman@alum.mit.edu> implemented
     toggling of marked files, setting of CVS command flags via prefix
     arguments, updated the XEmacs support, updated the manual, and
     fixed numerous bugs.

   * Stefan Monnier <monnier@cs.yale.edu> added a slew of other
     features and introduced even more new bugs.  If there's any bug
     left, you can be sure it's his.

   * Masatake YAMATO <masata-y@is.aist-nara.ac.jp> made a gracious
     contribution of his cvstree code to display a tree of tags which
     was later superseded by the new `cvs-status-mode'.

   Apart from these, a lot of people have sent us suggestions, ideas,
requests, bug reports and encouragement.  Thanks a lot!  Without you
there would be no new releases of PCL-CVS.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Installation,  Prev: Contributors,  Up: About PCL-CVS

Installation
============

   As mentioned above, PCL-CVS comes bundled with Emacs version 21.1 and
later.  If you're using Emacs 20, you can download an older version of
PCL-CVS from `ftp://flint.cs.yale.edu/pub/monnier/pcl-cvs'.  That
version also works on XEmacs.

   If you are running XEmacs 21.0 or later, PCL-CVS is available in
pre-compiled package form.  Please refer to the XEmacs manual for
instructions regarding package selection and installation.  Currently,
that PCL-CVS package also requires you to have installed the
`xemacs-base', `elib', and `dired' packages.

   If you have TeX installed at your site, you can make a typeset manual
from `pcl-cvs.texi'.

  1. If PCL-CVS came with the Emacs distribution, type `make
     pcl-cvs.dvi' in the `man' subdirectory of the Emacs source tree.

  2. Alternatively, run TeX by typing `texi2dvi pcl-cvs.texi'.

  3. Convert the resulting device independent file `pcl-cvs.dvi' to a
     form which your printer can output and print it.  If you have a
     PostScript printer, there is a program, `dvi2ps', which does.
     There is also a program which comes together with TeX, `dvips',
     which you can use.

Getting started
***************

   This document assumes that you know what CVS is, and that you at
least know the fundamental concepts of CVS.  If that is not the case,
you should read the CVS documentation.  Type `info -f cvs' or `man cvs'.

   PCL-CVS is only useful once you have checked out a module.  So before
you invoke it, you must have a copy of a module somewhere in the file
system.

   You can invoke PCL-CVS by typing `M-x cvs-examine <RET>'.  You can
also invoke it via the menu bar, under `Tools'.  Or, if you prefer, you
can also invoke PCL-CVS by simply visiting the CVS administrative
subdirectory of your module, with a prefix argument.  For example, to
invoke PCL-CVS in a separate frame, type `C-u C-x 5 f ~/my/project/CVS
<RET>'.

   The function `cvs-examine' will ask for a directory.  The command
`cvs -n update' will be run in that directory.  (It should contain
files that have been checked out from a CVS archive.)  The output from
`cvs' will be parsed and presented in a table in a buffer called
`*cvs*'.  It might look something like this:

     Repository : /usr/CVSroot
     Module     : test
     Working dir: /users/ceder/FOO/test
     
     
     In directory .:
                Need-Update            bar
                Need-Update            file.txt
                Modified               namechange
                Need-Update            newer
     In directory sub:
                Modified               ChangeLog
     
     --------------------- End ---------------------
     -- last cmd: cvs -f -z6 -n update -d -P --

   In this example, your repository is in `/usr/CVSroot' and CVS has
been run in the directory `/users/ceder/FOO/test'.  The three files
(`bar', `file.txt' and `newer') that are marked with `Need-Update' have
been changed by someone else in the CVS repository.  Two files
(`namechange' and `sub/ChangeLog') have been modified locally, and need
to be checked in.

   You can move the cursor up and down in the buffer with `C-n' and
`C-p' or `n' and `p'.  If you press `c' on one of the `Modified' files,
that file will be checked in to the CVS repository. *Note Committing
changes::.  You can also press `O' to update any of the files that are
marked `Need-Update'.  You can also run `M-x cvs-update <RET>' (bound
to `M-u' in the `*cvs*' buffer) to update all the files.

   You can then press `=' to easily get a `diff' between your modified
file and the base version that you started from, or you can press `l'
to get the output from `cvs log'.  Many more such commands are
available simply by pressing a key (*note Getting info about files::).


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Buffer contents,  Next: Selected files,  Prev: Getting started,  Up: Top

Buffer contents
***************

   The display contains several columns, some of which are optional.
These columns are, from left to right:

   * Optionally, the head revision of the file.  This is the latest
     version found in the repository.  It might also contain (instead
     of the head revision) a sub status which typically gives further
     information about how we got to the current state, for example
     `patched', `merged', ...

   * An asterisk when the file is "marked" (*note Selected files::).

   * The actual status of the file wrt the repository.  See below.

   * Optionally, the base revision of the file.  This is the version
     which the copy in your working directory is based upon.

   * The file name.


   The `file status' field can have the following values:

`Modified'
     The file is modified in your working directory, and there was no
     modification to the same file in the repository.  This status can
     have the following substatus:

    `merged'
          The file was modified in your working directory, and there
          were modifications in the repository as well, but they were
          merged successfully, without conflict, in your working
          directory.

`Conflict'
     A conflict was detected while trying to merge your changes to FILE
     with changes from the repository.  FILE (the copy in your working
     directory) is now the output of the `rcsmerge' command on the two
     versions; an unmodified copy of your file is also in your working
     directory, with the name `.#FILE.VERSION', where VERSION is the
     RCS revision that your modified file started from.  *Note Viewing
     differences::, for more details.

     A conflict can also come from a disagreement on the existence of
     the file rather than on its content.  This case is indicated by
     the following possible substatus:

    `removed'
          The file is locally removed but a new revision has been
          committed to the repository by someone else.

    `added'
          The file is locally added and has also been added to the
          repository by someone else.

    `modified'
          The file is locally modified but someone else has removed it
          from the repository.

`Added'
     The file has been added by you, but it still needs to be checked
     in to the repository.

`Removed'
     The file has been removed by you, but it still needs to be checked
     in to the repository.  You can resurrect it by typing `a' (*note
     Adding and removing files::).

`Unknown'
     A file that was detected in your directory, but that neither
     appears in the repository, nor is present on the list of files
     that CVS should ignore.

`Up-to-date'
     The file is up to date with respect to the version in the
     repository.  This status can have a substatus of:

    `added'
          You have just added the file to the repository.

    `updated'
          The file was brought up to date with respect to the
          repository.  This is done for any file that exists in the
          repository but not in your source, and for files that you
          haven't changed but are not the most recent versions
          available in the repository.

    `patched'
          The file was brought up to date with respect to the remote
          repository by way of fetching and applying a patch to the
          file in your source.  This is equivalent to `updated' except
          that CVS decided to use a hopefully more efficient method.

    `committed'
          You just committed the file.

`Need-Update'
     Either a newer version than the one in your source is available in
     the repository and you have not modified your checked out version,
     or the file exists in the repository but not in your source.  Use
     `cvs-mode-update' bound to `O' to update the file.

`Need-Merge'
     You have modified the checked out version of the file, and a newer
     version is available in the repository.  A merge will take place
     when you run a `cvs-update'.

`Missing'
     The file has been unexpectedly removed from your working directory
     although it has not been `cvs remove'd.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Selected files,  Next: Commands,  Prev: Buffer contents,  Up: Top

Selected files
**************

   Many of the commands work on the current set of "selected" files
which can be either the set of marked files (if any file is marked and
marks are no ignored) or whichever file or directory the cursor is on.

   If a directory is selected but the command cannot be applied to a
directory, then it will be applied to the set of files under this
directory which are in the `*cvs*' buffer.

   Furthermore, each command only operates on a subset of the selected
files, depending on whether or not the command is "applicable" to each
file (based on the file's status).  For example, `cvs-mode-commit' is
not applicable to a file whose status is `Need-Update'.  If it should
happen that PCL-CVS guesses the applicability wrong, you can override
it with the special prefix `cvs-mode-force-command' normally bound to
`M-f' (and file a bug report).  The applicability rule can be slightly
changed with `cvs-allow-dir-commit' and `cvs-force-dir-tag'.

   By default, marks are always in effect (you may change this,
however, by setting the variable `cvs-default-ignore-marks') except for
the commands that `tag' or `diff' a file (which can be changed with the
variable `cvs-invert-ignore-marks').

   In addition, you may use the special prefix `cvs-mode-toggle-marks'
normally bound to <T> to toggle the use of marks for the following
command.

   This scheme might seem a little complicated, but once one gets used
to it, it is quite powerful.

   For commands to mark and unmark files, see *Note Marking files::.

Entering PCL-CVS
================

   Most commands in PCL-CVS require that you have a `*cvs*' buffer.
The commands that you use to get one are listed below.  For each, a
`cvs' process will be run, the output will be parsed by PCL-CVS, and
the result will be printed in the `*cvs*' buffer (see *Note Buffer
contents::, for a description of the buffer's contents).

`M-x cvs-update'
     Run a `cvs update' command.  You will be asked for the directory
     in which the `cvs update' will be run.

`M-x cvs-examine'
     Run a `cvs -n update' command.  This is identical to the previous
     command, except that it will only check what needs to be done but
     will not change anything.  You will be asked for the directory in
     which the `cvs -n update' will be run.

`M-x cvs-status'
     Run a `cvs status' command.  You will be asked for the directory
     in which the `cvs status' will be run.

`M-x cvs-checkout'
     Run a `cvs checkout' command.  You will be asked for the directory
     in which the `cvs update' will be run and the module to be checked
     out.

`M-x cvs-quickdir'
     Populate the `*cvs*' buffer by just looking at the `CVS/Entries'
     files.  This is very much like `cvs-examine' except that it does
     not access the CVS repository, which is a major advantage when the
     repository is far away.  But of course, it will not be able to
     detect when a file needs to be updated or merged.

   The first four of those commands are also reachable from the menu bar
under `Tools->PCL-CVS'.  Finally, an alternative way is to visit the
CVS administrative subdirectory in your work area with a simple prefix
argument.  For example `C-u C-x C-f ~/my/work/CVS <RET>'.  This by
default runs `cvs-quickdir' but the specific behavior can be changed
with `cvs-dired-action' and `cvs-dired-use-hook'.

   By default, the commands above will descend recursively into
subdirectories.  You can avoid that behavior by including `-l' in the
flags for the command.  These flags can be set by giving a prefix
argument to the command (e.g., by typing `C-u M-x cvs-update <RET> -l
<RET>').


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Setting flags,  Next: Updating the buffer,  Prev: Entering PCL-CVS,  Up: Commands

Setting flags for CVS commands
==============================

   This section describes the convention used by nearly all PCL-CVS
commands for setting optional flags sent to CVS.  A single `C-u' prefix
argument is used to cause the command to prompt for flags to be used
for the current invocation of the command only.  Two `C-u' prefix
arguments are used to prompt for flags which will be set permanently,
for the current invocation and all that follow, until the flags are
changed, or unless temporary flags are set which override them.

   Perhaps an example or two is in order.  Say you are about to add a
binary file to the repository, and want to specify the flags `-kb' to
`cvs add'.  You can type `C-u a -kb <RET>', enter the description, and
the file will be added.  Subsequent `cvs add' commands will use the
previously prevailing flags.

   As a second example, say you are about to perform a diff and want to
see the result in unified diff format, i.e. you'd like to pass the flag
`-u' to both `cvs diff' and `diff'.  You'd also like all subsequent
diffs to use this flag.  You can type `C-u C-u = -u <RET>' and the diff
will be performed, and the default flags will be set to `("-u")'.  You
can of course override this flag for a single diff by using a single
`C-u' prefix argument.

   In addition to this, some commands can take "special prefix"
arguments.  These work as follows: When called with a `C-u' prefix, the
user is prompted for a new value of the special prefix and the special
prefix is activated for the next command.  When called without the `C-u'
prefix, the special prefix is re-activated (with the same value as last
time) for the next command.  Calling the prefix command again when it's
already activated deactivates it.  Calling it with the `C-u C-u' prefix
activates it for all subsequent commands until you deactivate it
explicitly.  The special prefixes are:

`T'
     Toggles whether or not marks will be active in the next command.

`b'
     Provide the next command with a branch (can be any version
     specifier) to work on.

`B'
     Secondary branch argument.  Only meaningful if `b' is also used.
     It can be used to provide a second branch argument to
     `cvs-mode-diff' or to `cvs-mode-update'.

`M-f'
     Forces the next command to apply to every selected file rather
     than only to the ones PCL-CVS thinks are relevant.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Updating the buffer,  Next: Movement commands,  Prev: Setting flags,  Up: Commands

Updating the `*cvs*' buffer
===========================

   The following commands can be used from within the `*cvs*' buffer to
update the display:

`M-u'
     Runs the command `cvs-update'.

`M-e'
     Runs the command `cvs-examine'.

`M-s'
     Runs the command `cvs-status'.

   In addition to the above commands which operate on the whole module,
you can run the equivalent CVS command on just a subset of the
files/directories with these keys:

`O'
     Runs `cvs-mode-update' on the selected files.  When run on the
     top-level directory, this is equivalent to `M-u'.

`e'
     Runs `cvs-mode-examine' on the selected files.  When run on the
     top-level directory, this is equivalent to `M-e'.

`s'
     Runs `cvs-mode-status' on the selected files.  When run on the
     top-level directory, this is equivalent to `M-s', except that CVS
     output will be shown in a `*cvs-info*' buffer that will be put in
     `cvs-status-mode'.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Movement commands,  Next: Marking files,  Prev: Updating the buffer,  Up: Commands

Movement Commands
=================

   You can use most normal Emacs commands to move forward and backward
in the buffer.  Some keys are rebound to functions that take advantage
of the fact that the buffer is a PCL-CVS buffer:

`<SPC>'
`n'
     These keys move the cursor one file forward, towards the end of the
     buffer (`cvs-mode-next-line').

`p'
     This key moves one file backward, towards the beginning of the
     buffer (`cvs-mode-previous-line').

Marking files
=============

   PCL-CVS works on a set of "selected files" (*note Selected files::).
You can mark and unmark files with these commands:

`m'
     This marks the file that the cursor is positioned on.  If the
     cursor is positioned on a directory all files in that directory
     are marked.  (`cvs-mode-mark').

`u'
     Unmark the file that the cursor is positioned on. If the cursor is
     on a directory, all files in that directory are unmarked.
     (`cvs-mode-unmark').

`M'
     Mark _all_ files in the buffer (`cvs-mode-mark-all-files').

`M-<DEL>'
     Unmark _all_ files (`cvs-mode-unmark-all-files').

`<DEL>'
     Unmark the file on the previous line, and move point to that line
     (`cvs-mode-unmark-up').

`<%>'
     Mark all files matching a regular expression
     (`cvs-mode-mark-matching-files').

`<T>'
     Toggle use of marks for the next command (`cvs-mode-toggle-marks').


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Committing changes,  Next: Editing files,  Prev: Marking files,  Up: Commands

Committing changes
==================

   Committing changes basically works as follows:

  1. After having selected the files you want to commit, you type either
     `c' or `C' which brings up a special buffer `*cvs-commit*'.

  2. You type in the log message describing the changes you're about to
     commit (*note Log Edit Mode::).

  3. When you're happy with it, you type `C-c C-c' to do the actual
     commit.

   There's no hidden state, so you can abort the process or pick it up
again at any time.

   The set of files actually committed is really decided only during the
very last step, which is a mixed blessing.  It allows you to go back and
change your mind about which files to commit, but it also means that you
might inadvertently change the set of selected files.  To reduce the
risk of error, `C-c C-c' will ask for confirmation if the set of
selected files has changed between the first step and the last.  You can
change this last detail with `log-edit-confirm'.

   As for the difference between `c' (i.e. `cvs-mode-commit') and `C'
(i.e. `cvs-mode-commit-setup') is that the first gets you straight to
`*cvs-commit*' without erasing it or changing anything to its content,
while the second first erases `*cvs-commit*' and tries to initialize it
with a sane default (it does that by either using a template provided
by the CVS administrator or by extracting a relevant log message from a
`ChangeLog' file).

   If you are editing the files in your Emacs, an automatic
`revert-buffer' will be performed.  (If the file contains `$Id: pcl-cvs,v 1.1.1.2 2002/09/10 23:32:32 jevans Exp $'
keywords, `cvs commit' will write a new file with the new values
substituted.  The auto-revert makes sure that you get them into your
buffer).  The revert will not occur if you have modified your buffer,
or if `cvs-auto-revert' is set to `nil'.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Editing files,  Next: Getting info about files,  Prev: Committing changes,  Up: Commands

Editing files
=============

   There are currently three commands that can be used to find a file
(that is, load it into a buffer and start editing it there).  These
commands work on the line that the cursor is situated at.  They always
ignore any marked files.

`f'
     Find the file that the cursor points to (`cvs-mode-find-file').  If
     the cursor points to a directory, run `dired' on that directory;
     *note (emacs)Dired::.

`o'
     Like `f', but use another window
     (`cvs-mode-find-file-other-window').

`A'
     Invoke `add-change-log-entry-other-window' to edit a `ChangeLog'
     file.  The `ChangeLog' file will be found in the directory of the
     file the cursor points to, or in a parent of that directory.
     (`cvs-mode-add-change-log-entry-other-window').


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Getting info about files,  Next: Adding and removing files,  Prev: Editing files,  Up: Commands

Getting info about files
========================

`l'
     Call the command `cvs-mode-log' which runs `cvs log' on all
     selected files, and show the result in a temporary buffer
     `*cvs-info*' (*note Log View Mode::).

`s'
     Call the command `cvs-mode-status' which runs `cvs status' on all
     selected files, and show the result in a temporary buffer
     `*cvs-info*'.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Adding and removing files,  Next: Undoing changes,  Prev: Getting info about files,  Up: Commands

Adding and removing files
=========================

   The following commands are available to make it easy to add fuiles to
and remove them from the CVS repository.

`a'
     Add all selected files.  This command can be used on `Unknown'
     files (*note Buffer contents::).  The status of the file will
     change to `Added', and you will have to use `c' (`cvs-mode-commit'
     *note Committing changes::), to really add the file to the
     repository.

     This command can also be used on `Removed' files (before you commit
     them) to resurrect them.

     The command that is run is `cvs-mode-add'.

`r'
     This command removes the selected files (after prompting for
     confirmation).  The files are deleted from your directory and
     (unless the status was `Unknown'; *note Buffer contents::) they
     will also be `cvs remove'd.  If the files' status was `Unknown'
     they will disappear from the buffer.  Otherwise their status will
     change to `Removed', and you must use `c' (`cvs-mode-commit',
     *note Committing changes::) to commit the removal.

     The command that is run is `cvs-mode-remove-file'.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Undoing changes,  Next: Removing handled entries,  Prev: Adding and removing files,  Up: Commands

Undoing changes
===============

`U'
     If you have modified a file, and for some reason decide that you
     don't want to keep the changes, you can undo them with this
     command.  It works by removing your working copy of the file and
     then getting the latest version from the repository
     (`cvs-mode-undo-local-changes'.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Removing handled entries,  Next: Ignoring files,  Prev: Undoing changes,  Up: Commands

Removing handled entries
========================

`x'
     This command allows you to remove all entries that you have
     processed.  More specifically, the lines for `Up-to-date' files
     (*note Buffer contents::) are removed from the buffer.  If a
     directory becomes empty the heading for that directory is also
     removed.  This makes it easier to get an overview of what needs to
     be done.

     `x' invokes `cvs-mode-remove-handled'.  If
     `cvs-auto-remove-handled' is set to non-`nil', this will
     automatically be performed after every commit.

`C-k'
     This command can be used for lines that `cvs-mode-remove-handled'
     would not delete, but that you want to delete
     (`cvs-mode-acknowledge').


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Ignoring files,  Next: Viewing differences,  Prev: Removing handled entries,  Up: Commands

Ignoring files
==============

`i'
     Arrange so that CVS will ignore the selected files.  The file
     names are added to the `.cvsignore' file in the corresponding
     directory.  If the `.cvsignore' file doesn't exist, it will be
     created.

     The `.cvsignore' file should normally be added to the repository,
     but you could ignore it as well, if you like it better that way.

     This runs `cvs-mode-ignore'.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Viewing differences,  Next: Invoking Ediff,  Prev: Ignoring files,  Up: Commands

Viewing differences
===================

`='
`d ='
     Display a `cvs diff' between the selected files and the version
     that they are based on. (`cvs-mode-diff').

`d b'
     If CVS finds a conflict while merging two versions of a file
     (during a `cvs update', *note Updating the buffer::) it will save
     the original file in a file called `.#FILE.VERSION' where FILE is
     the name of the file, and VERSION is the revision number that FILE
     was based on.

     With the `d b' command you can run a `diff' on the files
     `.#FILE.VERSION' and `FILE'.

`d h'
     Display a `cvs diff' between the selected files and the head
     revision in the repository (the most recent version on the current
     branch) (`cvs-mode-diff-head').

`d v'
     Display a `cvs diff' between the selected files and the head
     revision of the vendor branch in the repository.
     (`cvs-mode-diff-vendor').

   By default, `diff' commands ignore the marks.  This can be changed
with `cvs-invert-ignore-marks'.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Invoking Ediff,  Next: Updating files,  Prev: Viewing differences,  Up: Commands

Running ediff
=============

`d e'
     This uses `ediff' (or `emerge', depending on
     `cvs-idiff-imerge-handlers') to allow you to view diffs.  If a
     prefix argument is given, PCL-CVS will prompt for a revision
     against which the diff should be made, else the default will be to
     use the BASE revision.

`d E'
     This command use `ediff' (or `emerge', see above) to allow you to
     do an interactive 3-way merge.

     *Note:*  When the file status is `Conflict', CVS has already
     performed a merge.  The resulting file is not used in any way if
     you use this command.  If you use the `q' command inside `ediff'
     (to successfully terminate a merge) the file that CVS created will
     be overwritten.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Updating files,  Next: Tagging files,  Prev: Invoking Ediff,  Up: Commands

Updating files
==============

`O'
     Update all selected files with status `Need-update' by running
     `cvs update' on them.  (`cvs-mode-update').


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Tagging files,  Next: Miscellaneous commands,  Prev: Updating files,  Up: Commands

Tagging files
=============

`t'
     Tag all selected files by running `cvs tag' on them
     (`cvs-mode-tag').  It's usually preferable to tag a directory at a
     time.  Rather than selecting all files (which too often doesn't
     select all files but only the few that are displayed), clear the
     selection with `M-DEL' (`cvs-mode-unmark-all-files'), position the
     cursor on the directory you want to tag and hit `t'.

   By default, `tag' commands ignore the marks.  This can be changed
with `cvs-invert-ignore-marks'.  Also, by default `tag' can only be
applied to directories, see `cvs-force-dir-tag' if you want to change
this behavior.


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Miscellaneous commands,  Prev: Tagging files,  Up: Commands

Miscellaneous commands
======================

`M-x cvs-mode-byte-compile-files'
     Byte compile all selected files that end in `.el'.

`M-x cvs-mode-delete-lock'
     This command deletes the lock files that the `*cvs*' buffer
     informs you about.  You should normally never have to use this
     command, since CVS tries very carefully to always remove the lock
     files itself.

     You can only use this command when a message in the `*cvs*' buffer
     tells you so.  You should wait a while before using this command
     in case someone else is running a `cvs' command.

     Also note that this only works if the repository is local.

`?'
`h'
     Show a summary of common command key bindings in the echo area
     (`cvs-help').

`q'
     Quit PCL-CVS, killing the `*cvs*' buffer (`cvs-mode-quit').


File: pcl-cvs,  Node: Log Edit Mode,  Next: Log View Mode,  Prev: Commands,  Up: Top

Editing a Log Message
*********************

   Buffers for entering/editing log messages for changes which are about
to be committed are put into Log Edit mode.

   Sometimes the log buffer contains default text when you enter it,
typically the last log message entered.  If it does, mark and point are
set around the entire contents of the buffer so that it is easy to kill
the contents of the buffer with `C-w'.

   If you work by writing entries in the `ChangeLog' (*note
(emacs)Change Log::) and then commit the change under revision control,
you can generate the Log Edit text from the ChangeLog using `C-a C-a'
(`log-edit-insert-changelog').  This looks for entries for the file(s)
concerned in the top entry in the ChangeLog and uses those paragraphs
as the log text.  This text is only inserted if the top entry was made
under your user name on the current date.  *Note (emacs)Change Logs and
VC::, for the opposite way of working--generating ChangeLog entries
from the revision control log.

   In the Log Edit buffer, `C-c C-f' (`M-x log-edit-show-files') shows
the list of files to be committed in case you need to check that.

   When you have finished editing the log message, type `C-c C-c' to
exit the buffer and commit the change.

Browsing a Log of Changes
*************************

   Log View mode provides a few useful commands for navigating revision
control log output.  It is used for the output buffers of both
`cvs-mode-log' and `vc-print-log'.

   In this mode, `n' goes to the next message and `p' goes to the
previous message and `N' and `P' go to the next and previous files,
respectively, in multi-file output.  With a numeric prefix argument,
these commands move that many messages of files.

Customization
*************

   If you have an idea about any customization that would be handy but
isn't present in this list, please tell me!  For info on how to reach
me, see *Note Bugs::.

`cvs-auto-remove-handled'
     If this variable is set to any non-`nil' value,
     `cvs-mode-remove-handled' will be called every time you check in
     files, after the check-in is ready.  *Note Removing handled
     entries::.

`cvs-auto-remove-directories'
     If this variable is set to any non-`nil' value, directories that do
     not contain any files to be checked in will not be listed in the
     `*cvs*' buffer.

`cvs-auto-revert'
     If this variable is set to any non-`nil' value any buffers you have
     that visit a file that is committed will be automatically reverted.
     This variable defaults to `t'. *Note Committing changes::.

`cvs-update-prog-output-skip-regexp'
     The `-u' flag in the `modules' file can be used to run a command
     whenever a `cvs update' is performed (see `cvs(5)').  This regexp
     is used to search for the last line in that output.  It is
     normally set to `$'.  That setting is only correct if the command
     outputs nothing.  Note that PCL-CVS will get very confused if the
     command outputs _anything_ to `stderr'.

`cvs-cvsroot'
     This variable can be set to override `CVSROOT'.  It should be a
     string.  If it is set, then every time a `cvs' command is run, it
     will be called as `cvs -d CVS-CVSROOT...'.  This can be useful if
     your site has several repositories.

`log-edit-require-final-newline'
     When you enter a log message by typing into the
     `*cvs-commit-message*' buffer, PCL-CVS normally automatically
     inserts a trailing newline, unless there already is one.  This
     behavior can be controlled via
     `cvs-commit-buffer-require-final-newline'.  If it is `t' (the
     default behavior), a newline will always be appended.  If it is
     `nil', newlines will never be appended.  Any other value causes
     PCL-CVS to ask the user whenever there is no trailing newline in
     the commit message buffer.

`log-edit-changelog-full-paragraphs'
     If this variable is non-`nil', include full `ChangeLog' paragraphs
     in the CVS log created by `cvs-mode-changelog-commit'.  This may
     be set in the local variables section of a `ChangeLog' file, to
     indicate the policy for that `ChangeLog'.

     A "`ChangeLog' paragraph" is a bunch of log text containing no
     blank lines; a paragraph usually describes a set of changes with a
     single purpose, but perhaps spanning several functions in several
     files.  Changes in different paragraphs are unrelated.

     You could argue that the CVS log entry for a file should contain
     the full `ChangeLog' paragraph mentioning the change to the file,
     even though it may mention other files, because that gives you the
     full context you need to understand the change.  This is the
     behavior you get when this variable is set to `t', the default.

     On the other hand, you could argue that the CVS log entry for a
     change should contain only the text for the changes which occurred
     in that file, because the CVS log is per-file.  This is the
     behavior you get when this variable is set to `nil'.

`cvs-sort-ignore-file'
     If this variable is set to any non-`nil' value, the `.cvsignore'
     file will always be sorted whenever you use `cvs-mode-ignore' to
     add a file to it.  This option is on by default.

   PCL-CVS adds a few extra features, including menus, mouse bindings,
and fontification the `*cvs*' buffer.  The faces defined for
fontification are listed below:

`cvs-header-face'

`cvs-filename-face'
     used to highlight file names.

`cvs-unknown-face'
     used to highlight the status of files which are `Unknown'.

`cvs-handled-face'
     used to highlight the status of files which are handled and need
     no further action.

`cvs-need-action-face'
     used to highlight the status of files which still need action.

`cvs-marked-face'
     used to highlight the marked file indicator (`*').
