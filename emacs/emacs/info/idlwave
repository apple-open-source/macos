Introduction
************

   IDLWAVE is a package to support editing command files for the
Interactive Data Language (IDL), and for running IDL as an inferior
shell.  It also can be used for WAVE/CL command files, but the support
for these is limited.  Note that this package has nothing to do with the
Interface Definition Language as part of the Common Object Request
Broker Architecture (CORBA).

   IDLWAVE is the successor to the `idl.el' and `idl-shell.el' files
written by Chris Chase.  The modes and files had to be renamed because
of a name space conflict with CORBAs `idl-mode', defined in Emacs in
the file `cc-mode.el'.  If you have been using the old files, check
*Note Upgrading from idl.el:: for information on how to switch.

   IDLWAVE consists of two parts: A major mode for editing command files
(`idlwave-mode') and a mode to allow running the IDL program as an
inferior shell (`idlwave-shell-mode').  Both modes work closely
together and form a complete development environment.

   Here is a brief summary of what IDLWAVE does.

   * Code indentation and formatting.

   * Font-lock support on three levels.

   * Display of calling sequence and keywords of more than 1000 IDL
     routines and any routines in your local IDL library.

   * Name space conflict search.

   * Fast context-sensitive online help.

   * Context sensitive completion of routine names and keywords.

   * Insertion of code templates.

   * Actions to enforce coding standards during typing.

   * Block structure check.

   * Support for `imenu' (Emacs) and `func-menu' (XEmacs).

   * Documentation support.

   * Running IDL as inferior process.

   * Shell with history search, command line editing and completion.

   * Compilation, execution and debugging of programs directly from the
     source buffer.

   * Examining expressions with a mouse click.

   Here are a number of screenshots showing IDLWAVE in action.

   * XEmacs 21.1 with formatted and fontified code
     (http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~dominik/Tools/idlwave/font-lock.gif)

   * XEmacs 21.1 displaying routine info

   In this manual, each section contains a list of user options related
to the subject.  Don't be confused by the shear number of options
available - in most cases the default settings are just fine.  The
variables are listed here to make sure you know where to look if you
want to change things.  For a full description of what a particular
variable does and how to configure it, see the documentation string of
that variable.  Some configuration examples are also given in the
appendix.

Getting Started (Tutorial)
**************************

Lession I: Development Cycle
============================

   The purpose of this tutorial is to guide you through a very basic
development cycle with IDLWAVE.  We will type a simple program into a
buffer and use the shell to compile, debug and run this program.  On the
way we will use the most important commands in IDLWAVE.  Note however
that there is much more funtionality available in IDLWAVE than we cover
here, and it will pay off greatly if eventually you go further and read
the whole manual.

   I assume that you have access to Emacs or XEmacs with the full
IDLWAVE package including online help (*note Installation::).  I also
assume that you are familiar with Emacs and can read the nomenclature
of key presses in Emacs (in particular, `C' stands for <CONTROL> and
`M' for <META> (often the <ALT> key carries this functionality)).

   Open a new source file by typing

     C-x C-f tutorial.pro <RET>

   A buffer for this file will pop up, and it should be in IDLWAVE mode.
You can see this by looking at the mode line, just below the editing
window.  Also, the menu bar should contain entries `IDLWAVE' and
`Debug'.

   Now cut-and-paste the following program, also available as
`tutorial.pro' in the IDLWAVE distribution.

     function daynr,d,m,y
       ;; compute a sequence number for a date
       ;; works 1901-2099.
       if y lt 100 then y = y+1900
       if m le 2 then delta = 1 else delta = 0
       m1 = m + delta*12 + 1
       y1 = y * delta
       return, d + floor(m1*30.6)+floor(y1*365.25)+5
     end
     
     function weekday,day,month,year
       ;; compute weekday number for date
       nr = daynr(day,month,year)
       return, nr mod 7
     end
     
     pro plot_wday,day,month
       ;; Plot the weekday of a date in the first 10 years of this century.
       years = 2000,+indgen(10)
       wdays = intarr(10)
       for i=0,n_elements(wdays)-1 do begin
          wdays[i] =  weekday(day,month,years[i])
       end
       plot,years,wdays,YS=2,YT="Wday (0=sunday)"
     end

   The indentation probably looks funny, since it's different from the
settings you use, so use the <TAB> key in each line to automatically
line it up (or more quickly _select_ the entire buffer with `C-x h'
followed by `M-C-\').  Notice how different syntactical elements are
highlighted in different colors, if you have set up support for
font-lock.

   Let's check out two particular editing features of IDLWAVE.  Place
the cursor after the `end' statement of the `for' loop and press <SPC>.
IDLWAVE blinks back to the beginning of the block and changes the
generic `end' to the specific `endfor' automatically.  Now place the
cursor in any line you would like to split into two and press
`M-<RET>'.  The line is split at the cursor position, with the
continuation `$' and indentation all taken care of.  Use `C-/' to undo
the last change.

   The procedure `plot_wday' is supposed to plot the weekday of a given
date for the first 10 years of the 21st century.  I have put in a few
bugs which we are going to fix now.

   First, let's launch the IDLWAVE shell.  You do this with the command
`C-c C-s'.  The Emacs window will split and display IDL running in a
shell interaction buffer.  Type a few commands like `print,!PI' to
convince yourself that you can work there like in an xterminal, or the
IDLDE.  Use the arrow keys to cycle through your command history.  Are
we having fun now?

   Now go back to the source window and type `C-c C-d C-c' to compile
the program.  If you watch the shell buffer, you see that IDLWAVE types
`.run tutorial.pro' for you.  But the compilation fails because there
is a comma in the line `years=...'.  The line with the error is
highlighted and the cursor positioned at the error, so remove the comma
(you should only need to hit Delete!).  Compile again, using the same
keystrokes as before.  Notice that the file is saved for you.  This
time everything should work fine, and you should see the three routines
compile.

   Now we want to use the command to plot the weekdays for January 1st.
We could type the full command ourselves, but why do that?  Go back to
the shell window, type `plot_' and hit <TAB>.  After a bit of a delay
(while IDLWAVE initializes its routine info database), the window will
split to show all procedures it knows starting with that string, and
`plot_wday' should be one of them.  Saving the buffer was enough to
tell IDLWAVE about this new routine.  Click with the middle mouse
button on `plot_wday' and it will be copied to the shell buffer, or if
you prefer, add `w' to `plot_' to make it unambiguous, hit <TAB>, and
the full routine name will be completed.  Now provide the two arguments:

     plot_wday,1,1

   and press <RET>.  This fails with an error message telling you the
`YT' keyword to plot is ambiguous.  What are the allowed keywords
again?  Go back to the source window and put the cursor into the `plot'
line, and press `C-c ?'.  This pops up the routine info window for the
plot routine, which contains a list of keywords, and the argument list.
Oh, we wanted `YTITLE'.  Fix that up.  Recompile with `C-c C-d C-c'.
Jump back into the shell with `C-c C-s', press the <UP> arrow to recall
the previous command and execute again.

   This time we get a plot, but it is pretty ugly - the points are all
connected with a line.  Hmm, isn't there a way for `plot' to use
symbols instead?  What was that keyword?  Position the cursor on the
plot line after a comma (where you'd normally type a keyword), and hit
`M-<Tab>'.  A long list of plot's keywords appears.  Aha, there it is,
`PSYM'.  Middle click to insert it.  An `=' sign is included for you
too.  Now what were the values of `PSYM' supposed to be?  With the
cursor on or after the keyword, press `M-?' for online help
(alternatively, you could have right clicked on the colored keyword
itself in the completion list).  The online help window will pop up
showing the documentation for the `PYSM' keyword.  Ok, let's use
diamonds=4.  Fix this, recompile (you know the command by now: `C-c C-d
C-c', go back to the shell (if it's vanished, you know the command to
recall it by now: `C-c C-s') and execute again.  Now things look pretty
good.

   Lets try a different day - how about April fool's day?

     plot_wday,1,4

   Oops, this looks very wrong.  All April fool's days cannot be
Fridays!  We've got a bug in the program, perhaps in the `daynr'
function.  Lets put a breakpoint on the last line there.  Position the
cursor on the `return, d+...' line and press `C-c C-d C-b'.  IDL sets a
breakpoint (as you see in the shell window), and the line is
highlighted in some way.  Back to the shell buffer, re-execute the
previous command.  IDL stops at the line with the breakpoint.  Now hold
down the SHIFT key and click with the middle mouse button on a few
variables there: `d', `y', `m', `y1', etc.  Maybe `d' isn't the correct
type.  CONTROL-SHIFT middle-click on it for help.  Well, it's an
integer, so that's not the problem.  Aha, `y1' is zero, but it should
be the year, depending on delta.  Shift click `delta' to see that it's
0.  Below, we see the offending line: `y1=y*delta...' the
multiplication should have been a minus sign!  So fix the line to

     y1 = y - delta

   Now remove all breakpoints: `C-c C-d C-a'.  Recompile and rerun the
command.  Everything should now work fine.  How about those leap years?
Change the code to plot 100 years and see that every 28 years, the
sequence of weekdays repeats.

Lession II: Customization
=========================

   Emacs is probably the most customizable piece of software available,
and it would be a shame if you did not make use of this and adapt
IDLWAVE to your own preferences.  Customizing Emacs or IDLWAVE means
that you have to set Lisp variables in the `.emacs' file in your home
directory.  This looks scary to many people because of all the
parenthesis.  However, you can just cut and paste the examples given
here and work from there.

   Lets first use a boolean variable.  These are variables which you
turn on or off, much like a checkbox. A value of `t' means on, a value
of `nil' means off.  Copy the following line into your `.emacs' file,
exit and restart Emacs.

     (setq idlwave-reserved-word-upcase t)

   When this option is turned on, each reserved word you type into an
IDL source buffer will be converted to upper case when you press <SPC>
or <RET> right after the word.  Try it out!  `if' changes to `IF',
`begin' to `BEGIN'.  If you don't like this behavior, remove the option
again from your `.emacs' file.

   Now I bet you have your own indentation preferences for IDL code.
For example, I like to indent the main block of an IDL program a bit,
different from the conventions used by RSI.  Also, I'd like to use only
3 spaces as indentation between `BEGIN' and `END'.  Try the following
lines in `.emacs'

     (setq idlwave-main-block-indent 2)
     (setq idlwave-block-indent 3)
     (setq idlwave-end-offset -3)

   Restart Emacs, take the program we developed in the first part of
this tutorial and re-indent it with `C-c h' and `M-C-\'.  You probably
want to keep these lines in `.emacs', with values adjusted to your
likings.  If you want to get more information about any of these
variables, type, e.g., `C-h v idlwave-main-block-indent <RET>'.  To
find which variables can be customized, look for items marked `User
Option:' in the manual.

   If you cannot wrap your head around this Lisp stuff, there is
another, more user-friendly way to customize all the IDLWAVE variables.
You can access it through the IDLWAVE menu in one of the `.pro'
buffers, option `Customize->Browse IDLWAVE Group'. Here you'll be
presented with all the various variables grouped into categories.  You
can navigate the hierarchy (e.g. Idlwave Code Formatting->Idlwave Main
Block Indent), read about the variables, change them, and `Save for
Future Sessions'.  Few of these variables need customization, but you
can exercise considerable control over IDLWAVE's functionality with
them.

   Many people I talk to find the key bindings used for the debugging
commands too long and complicated.  Do I always have to type `C-c C-d
C-c' to get a single simple command?  Due to Emacs rules and
conventions I cannot make better bindings by default, but you can.
First, there is a way to assign all debugging commands in a single sweep
to other combinations.  The only problem is that we have to use
something which Emacs does not need for other important commands.  A
good option is to execute debugging commands by holding down <CONTROL>
and <SHIFT> while pressing a single character: `C-S-b' for setting a
breakpoint, `C-S-c' for compiling the current source file, `C-S-a' for
deleting all breakpoints.  You can have this with

     (setq idlwave-shell-debug-modifiers '(shift control))

   If you have a special keyboard with for example a <HYPER> key, you
could use

     (setq idlwave-shell-debug-modifiers '(hyper))

   instead to get compilation on `H-c'.

   You can also assign specific commands to function keys.  This you
must do in the _mode-hook_, a special function which is run when a new
buffer gets set up.  Keybindings can only be done when the buffer
exists.  The possibilities for key customization are endless.  Here we
set function keys f5-f8 to common debugging commands.

     ;; First for the source buffer
     (add-hook 'idlwave-mode-hook
        (lambda ()
         (local-set-key [f5] 'idlwave-shell-break-here)
         (local-set-key [f6] 'idlwave-shell-clear-current-bp)
         (local-set-key [f7] 'idlwave-shell-cont)
         (local-set-key [f8] 'idlwave-shell-clear-all-bp)))
     ;; Then for the shell buffer
     (add-hook 'idlwave-shell-mode-hook
        (lambda ()
         (local-set-key [f5] 'idlwave-shell-break-here)
         (local-set-key [f6] 'idlwave-shell-clear-current-bp)
         (local-set-key [f7] 'idlwave-shell-cont)
         (local-set-key [f8] 'idlwave-shell-clear-all-bp)))

Lession III: Library Catalog
============================

   We have already used the routine info display in the first part of
this tutorial.  This was the key `C-c ?' which displays information
about the IDL routine near the cursor position.  Wouldn't it be nice to
have the same available for your own library routines and for the huge
amount of code in major extension libraries like JHUPL or the IDL-Astro
library?  To do this, you must give IDLWAVE a chance to study these
routines first.  We call this _Building the library catalog_.

   From the IDLWAVE entry in the menu bar, select `Routine Info/Select
Catalog Directories'.  If necessary, start the shell first with `C-c
C-s' (*note Starting the Shell::).  IDLWAVE will find out about the IDL
`!PATH' variable and offer a list of directories on the path.  Simply
select them all (or whichever you want) and click on the `Scan&Save'
button.  Then go for a cup of coffee while IDLWAVE collects information
for each and every IDL routine on your search path.  All this
information is written to the file `.idlcat' in your home directory and
will from now one be automatically loaded whenever you use IDLWAVE.
Try to use routine info (`C-c ?') or completion (`M-<TAB>') while on
any routine or partial routine name you know to be located in the
library.  E.g., if you have scanned the IDL-Astro library:

         a=readf<M-<TAB>>

   expands to `readfits('.  Then try

         a=readfits(<C-c ?>

   and you get:

     Usage:    Result = READFITS(filename, header, heap)
     ...

   I hope you made it until here.  Now you are set to work with IDLWAVE.
On the way you will want to change other things, and to learn more about
the possibilities not discussed in this short tutorial.  Read the
manual, look at the documentation strings of interesting variables (with
`C-h v idlwave<-variable-name> <RET>') and ask the remaining questions
on `comp.lang.idl-pvwave'.

Code Indentation
----------------

   Like all Emacs programming modes, IDLWAVE performs code indentation.
The <TAB> key indents the current line relative to context.  <LFD>
insert a newline and indents the new line.  The indentation is governed
by a number of variables.

   To re-indent a larger portion of code (e.g. when working with
foreign code written with different conventions), use `M-C-\'
(`indent-region') after marking the relevant code.  Useful marking
commands are `C-x h' (the entire file) or `M-C-h' (the current
subprogram). *Note Actions::, for information how to impose additional
formatting conventions on foreign code.

 - User Option: idlwave-main-block-indent (`0')
     Extra indentation for the main block of code.  That is the block
     between the FUNCTION/PRO statement and the END statement for that
     program unit.

 - User Option: idlwave-block-indent (`5')
     Extra indentation applied to block lines.  If you change this, you
     probably also want to change `idlwave-end-offset'.

 - User Option: idlwave-end-offset (`-4')
     Extra indentation applied to block END lines.  A value equal to
     negative `idlwave-block-indent' will make END lines line up with
     the block BEGIN lines.

 - User Option: idlwave-continuation-indent (`2')
     Extra indentation applied to continuation lines and inside
     unbalanced parenthesis.


File: idlwave,  Node: Comment Indentation,  Next: Continuation Lines,  Prev: Code Indentation,  Up: Code Formatting

Comment Indentation
-------------------

   In IDL, lines starting with a `;' are called _comment lines_.
Comment lines are indented as follows:

`;;;'   The indentation of lines starting with three semicolons remains
        unchanged.
`;;'    Lines starting with two semicolons are indented like the
        surrounding code.
`;'     Lines starting with a single semicolon are indent to a minimum
        column.

The indentation of comments starting in column 0 is never changed.

 - User Option: idlwave-no-change-comment
     The indentation of a comment starting with this regexp will not be
     changed.

 - User Option: idlwave-begin-line-comment
     A comment anchored at the beginning of line.

 - User Option: idlwave-code-comment
     A comment that starts with this regexp is indented as if it is a
     part of IDL code.


File: idlwave,  Node: Continuation Lines,  Next: Syntax Highlighting,  Prev: Comment Indentation,  Up: Code Formatting

Continuation Lines and Filling
------------------------------

   In IDL, a newline character terminates a statement unless preceded
by a `$'.  If you would like to start a continuation line, use
`M-<RET>' which calls the command `idlwave-split-line'.  It inserts a
`$' to indicate that the following line is a continuation of the
current line, terminates the line with a newline and indents the new
line.  The command `M-<RET>' can also be used in the middle of a line
to split the line at that point.  When used inside a long string
constant, the string is split with the `+' concatenation operator.

   When filling comment paragraphs, IDLWAVE overloads the normal filling
functions and uses a function which creates hanging paragraphs as they
are customary in the IDL routine headers.  When `auto-fill-mode' is
turned on (toggle with `C-c C-a'), comments will be auto-filled.  If
the first line of a paragraph is matched by
`idlwave-hang-indent-regexp', subsequent lines are indented to after
the position of this match, as in the following example.

     ; INPUTS:
     ; x - an array containing
     ;     lots of interesting numbers.
     ;
     ; y - another variable where
     ;     a hanging paragraph is used
     ;     to describe it.

   You also refill a comment paragraph with `M-q'.

 - User Option: idlwave-fill-comment-line-only (`t')
     Non-`nil' means auto fill will only operate on comment lines.

 - User Option: idlwave-auto-fill-split-string (`t')
     Non-`nil' means auto fill will split strings with the IDL `+'
     operator.

 - User Option: idlwave-split-line-string (`t')
     Non-`nil' means `idlwave-split-line' will split strings with `+'.

 - User Option: idlwave-hanging-indent (`t')
     Non-`nil' means comment paragraphs are indented under the hanging
     indent given by `idlwave-hang-indent-regexp' match in the first
     line of the paragraph.

 - User Option: idlwave-hang-indent-regexp
     Regular expression matching the position of the hanging indent in
     the first line of a comment paragraph.

 - User Option: idlwave-use-last-hang-indent (`nil')
     Non-`nil' means use last match on line for `idlwave-indent-regexp'.

Syntax Highlighting
-------------------

   Highlighting of keywords, comments, strings etc. can be accomplished
with `font-lock'.  If you are using `global-font-lock-mode' (on Emacs),
or have `font-lock' turned on in any other buffer in XEmacs, it should
also automatically work in IDLWAVE buffers.  If not, you can enforce it
with the following line in your `.emacs'

     (add-hook 'idlwave-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)

   IDLWAVE supports 3 levels of syntax highlighting.  The variable
`font-lock-maximum-decoration' determines which level is selected.

 - User Option: idlwave-default-font-lock-items
     Items which should be fontified on the default fontification level
     2.


File: idlwave,  Node: Routine Info,  Next: Online Help,  Prev: Code Formatting,  Up: The IDLWAVE Major Mode

Routine Info
============

   IDL defines more than one thousand procedures, functions and object
methods.  This large command set makes it difficult to remember the
calling sequence and keywords of a command.  IDLWAVE contains a list of
all builtin routines with calling sequences and keywords(1).  It also
scans Emacs buffers and library files for routine definitions and
queries the IDLWAVE-Shell for the properties of modules currently
compiled under the shell.  This information is updated automatically.
If you think the information is not up-to-date, use `C-c C-i'
(`idlwave-update-routine-info') to enforce a global update.

   To display the information about a routine, press `C-c ?' which
calls the command `idlwave-routine-info'.  When the current cursor
position is on the name or in the argument list of a procedure or
function, information will be displayed about the routine.  For example,
consider the cursor positions in the following line

     plot,x,alog(x+5*sin(x) + 2),
       1  2   3   4   5  6  7    8

   On positions 1,2 and 8, information about the `plot' procedure will
be shown.  On positions 3,4, and 7, the `alog' function will be
described, while positions 5 and 6 will select the `sin' function.
When you ask for routine information about an object method, and the
method exists in several classes, IDLWAVE queries for the class of the
object.

   The description displayed contains the calling sequence, the list of
keywords and the source location of this routine.  It looks like this:

     Usage:    XMANAGER, NAME, ID
     Keywords: BACKGROUND CATCH CLEANUP EVENT_HANDLER GROUP_LEADER
               JUST_REG MODAL NO_BLOCK
     Source:   SystemLib   [CSB] /soft1/idl53/lib/xmanager.pro

   If a definition of this routine exists in several files accessible to
IDLWAVE, several `Source' lines will point to the different files.
This may indicate that your routine is shadowing a library routine,
which may or may not be what you want (*note Load-Path Shadows::).  The
information about the calling sequence and the keywords is derived from
the first source listed.  Library routines can only be supported if you
have scanned the local IDL library (*note Library Catalog::).  The
source entry consists of a _source category_, a set of _flags_ and the
path to the _source file_.  The following categories exist:

System      A system routine, but we do not know if it is Builtin or
            SystemLib.  When the system library has bee scanned (*note
            Library Catalog::), this category will automatically split
            into the next two.
Builtin     A builtin routine with no source code available.
SystemLib   A library routine in the official lib directory `!DIR/lib'.
Obsolete    A library routine in the official lib directory
            `!DIR/lib/obsolete'.
Library     A file on IDL's search path `!PATH'.
Other       Any other file not known to be on the search path.
Unresolved  The shell lists this routine as unresolved.

   You can define additional categories based on the file name and path
with the variable `idlwave-special-lib-alist'.

   The flags `[CSB]' indicate if the file is known to IDLWAVE from the
library catalog (`[C--]', *note Library Catalog::), from the Shell
(`[-S-]') or from an Emacs buffer (`[--B]').  Combinations are
possible.  If a file contains multiple definitions of the same routine,
the file name will be prefixed with `(Nx)' where `N' is the number of
definitions.

   Some of the text in the `*Help*' buffer will be active (it
highlights when you move the mouse over it).  Clicking on these items
will have the following effects:

Usage       If online help is installed, a click with the _right_ mouse
            button on the Usage: line will access the help for the
            routine (*note Online Help::).
Keyword     Online help about keywords is also available with the
            _right_ mouse button.  Clicking on a keyword with the
            _middle_ mouse button will insert this keyword in the buffer
            from where `idlwave-routine-info' was called.  Holding down
            <SHIFT> while clicking also adds the initial `/'.
Source      Clicking with the _middle_ mouse button on a `Source' line
            finds the source file of the routine and visits it in
            another window.  Another click on the same line switches
            back to the buffer from which `C-c ?' was called.  If you
            use the _right_ mouse button, the source will not be visited
            by a buffer, but displayed in the online help window.
Classes     The Classes line is only included in the routine info window
            if the current class inherits from other classes.  You can
            click with the _middle_ mouse button to display routine info
            about the current method in other classes on the inheritance
            chain.

 - User Option: idlwave-resize-routine-help-window (`t')
     Non-`nil' means, resize the Routine-info `*Help*' window to fit
     the content.

 - User Option: idlwave-special-lib-alist
     Alist of regular expressions matching special library directories.

 - User Option: idlwave-rinfo-max-source-lines (`5')
     Maximum number of source files displayed in the Routine Info

Online Help
===========

   For IDL system routines, RSI provides extensive documentation.
IDLWAVE can access an ASCII version of this documentation very quickly
and accurately.  This is _much_ faster than using the IDL online help
application, also because usually IDLWAVE gets you to the right place in
the docs directly, without additional browsing and scrolling.  For this
online help to work, you need an ASCII version of the IDL documentation
which is not part of the standard IDLWAVE distribution.  The required
files can be downloaded from the maintainers webpage
(http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~dominik/Tools/idlwave).  As the text is
extracted from PDF files, the formatting of the help text is good for
normal text, but graphics and multiline equations will not be well
represented.  See also *Note Documentation Scan::.

   For routines which are not documented in the IDL manual (for example
your own routines), the source code is used as help text.  If the
requested information can be found in a (more or less) standard DocLib
file header, IDLWAVE shows the header.  Otherwise the routine definition
statement (`pro'/`function') is shown.

   In any IDL program, press `M-?' (`idlwave-context-help') or click
with `S-Mouse-3' to access context sensitive online help.  The
following locations are recognized as context:

Routine name       The name of a routine (function, procedure, method).
Keyword Parameter  Keyword parameter of a routine.
System Variable    System variable like `!DPI'.
IDL Statement      Like `PRO', `REPEAT', or `COMPILE_OPT'.
Class name         Class name in `OBJ_NEW' call.
Executive Command  Executive command like `.RUN'.  Mostly useful in the
                   shell.
Default            The routine that would be selected for routine info
                   display.

   Note that the `OBJ_NEW' function is special in that the help
displayed depends on the cursor position: If the cursor is on the
`OBJ_NEW', this function is described.  If it is on the class name
inside the quotes, the documentation for the class is pulled up.  If the
cursor is _after_ the class name, anywhere in the argument list, the
documentation for the corresponding `Init' method and its keywords is
targeted.

Apart from source buffers, there are two more places from which online
help can be accessed.

   * Online help for routines and keywords can be accessed through the
     Routine Info display.  Click with `Mouse-3' on an item to see the
     corresponding help (*note Routine Info::).

   * When using completion and Emacs pops up a window with possible
     completions, clicking with `Mouse-3' on a completion item invokes
     help on that item (*note Completion::).

In both cases, a blue face indicates that the item is documented in the
IDL manual.

   The help window is normally displayed in a separate frame.  The
following commands can be used to navigate inside the help system.

`<SPACE>'   Scroll forward one page.
`<RET>'     Scroll forward one line.
`<DEL>'     Scroll back one page.
`n, p'      Browse to the next or previous topic (in physical sequence).
`b, f'      Move back and forward through the help topic history.
`c'         Clear the history.
`Mouse-2'   Follow a link.  Active links are displayed in a different
            font.  Items under See Also are active, and classes have
            links to their methods and back.
`o'         Open a topic.  The topic can be selected with completion.
`*'         Load the whole help file into Emacs, for global text
            searches.
`q'         Kill the help window.


When the help text is a source file, the following commands are also
available.
`h'         Jump to DocLib Header of the routine whose source is
            displayed as help.
`H'         Jump to the first DocLib Header in the file.
`.' (Dot)   Jump back and forth between the routine definition (the
            `pro'/`function' statement) and the description of the help
            item in the DocLib header.
`F'         Fontify the buffer like source code.  See the variable
            `idlwave-help-fontify-source-code'.

 - User Option: idlwave-help-directory
     The directory where idlw-help.txt and idlw-help.el are stored.

 - User Option: idlwave-help-use-dedicated-frame (`t')
     Non-nil means, use a separate frame for Online Help if possible.

 - User Option: idlwave-help-frame-parameters
     The frame parameters for the special Online Help frame.

 - User Option: idlwave-max-popup-menu-items (`20')
     Maximum number of items per pane in pop-up menus.

 - User Option: idlwave-extra-help-function
     Function to call for help if the normal help fails.

 - User Option: idlwave-help-fontify-source-code (`nil')
     Non-nil means, fontify source code displayed as help.

 - User Option: idlwave-help-source-try-header (`t')
     Non-nil means, try to find help in routine header when displaying
     source file.

 - User Option: idlwave-help-link-face
     The face for links to IDLWAVE online help.

 - User Option: idlwave-help-activate-links-agressively (`t')
     Non-`nil' means, make all possible links in help window active.


File: idlwave,  Node: Completion,  Next: Routine Source,  Prev: Online Help,  Up: The IDLWAVE Major Mode

Completion
==========

   IDLWAVE offers completion for class names, routine names and
keywords.  As in many programming modes, completion is bound to
`M-<TAB>'.  Completion uses the same internal information as routine
info, so when necessary it can be updated with `C-c C-i'
(`idlwave-update-routine-info').

   The completion function is context sensitive and figures out what to
complete at point.  Here are example lines and what `M-<TAB>' would try
to complete when the cursor is on the position marked with a `*'.

     plo*                    Procedure
     x = a*                  Function
     plot,xra*               Keyword of `plot' procedure
     plot,x,y,/x*            Keyword of `plot' procedure
     plot,min(*              Keyword of `min' function
     obj -> a*               Object method (procedure)
     a(2,3) = obj -> a*      Object method (function)
     x = obj_new('IDL*       Class name
     x = obj_new('MyCl',a*   Keyword to `Init' method in class `MyCl'
     pro A*                  Class name
     pro *                   Fill in `Class::' of first method in this file
     !v*                     System variable
     !version.t*             Structure tag of system variable
     self.g*                 Class structure tag in methods

   If the list of completions is too long to fit in the `*Completions*'
window, the window can be scrolled by pressing `M-<TAB>' repeatedly.
Online help (if installed) for each possible completion is available by
clicking with `Mouse-3' on the item.  Items for which system online
help (from the IDL manual) is available will be displayed in a
different font.  For other items, the corresponding source code or
DocLib header is available as help text.

   The case of the completed words is determined by what is already in
the buffer.  When the partial word being completed is all lower case,
the completion will be lower case as well.  If at least one character is
upper case, the string will be completed in upper case or mixed case.
The default is to use upper case for procedures, functions and keywords,
and mixed case for object class names and methods, similar to the
conventions in the IDL manuals.  These defaults can be changed with the
variable `idlwave-completion-case'.

 - User Option: idlwave-completion-case
     Association list setting the case (UPPER/lower/Capitalized/...) of
     completed words.

 - User Option: idlwave-completion-force-default-case (`nil')
     Non-`nil' means, completion will always honor the settings in
     `idlwave-completion-case'.  When nil (the default), lower case
     strings will be completed to lower case.

 - User Option: idlwave-complete-empty-string-as-lower-case (`nil')
     Non-`nil' means, the empty string is considered lower case for
     completion.

 - User Option: idlwave-keyword-completion-adds-equal (`t')
     Non-`nil' means, completion automatically adds `=' after completed
     keywords.

 - User Option: idlwave-function-completion-adds-paren (`t')
     Non-`nil' means, completion automatically adds `(' after completed
     function.  A value of `2' means, also add the closing parenthesis
     and position cursor between the two.

 - User Option: idlwave-completion-restore-window-configuration (`t')
     Non-`nil' means, restore window configuration after successful
     completion.

 - User Option: idlwave-highlight-help-links-in-completion (`t')
     Non-nil means, highlight completions for which system help is
     available.

Object Method Completion and Class Ambiguity
............................................

   An object method is not uniquely determined without the object's
class.  Since the class part is usually omitted in the source code,
IDLWAVE considers all available methods in all classes as possible
completions of an object method name.  For keywords, the combined
keywords of the current method in all available classes will be
considered.  In the `*Completions*' buffer, the classes allowed for
each completion will be shown next to the item (see option
`idlwave-completion-show-classes').  As a special case, the class of an
object called `self' object is always the class of the current routine.
All classes it inherits from are considered as well where appropriate.

   You can also call `idlwave-complete' with a prefix arg: `C-u
M-<TAB>'.  IDLWAVE will then prompt you for the class in order to
narrow down the number of possible completions.  The variable
`idlwave-query-class' can be configured to make this behavior the
default (not recommended).  After you have specified the class for a
particular statement (e.g. when completing the method), IDLWAVE can
remember it for the rest of the editing session.  Subsequent
completions in the same statement (e.g. keywords) can then reuse this
class information.  Remembering the class works by placing a text
property in the object operator `->'.  This is not enabled by default -
the variable `idlwave-store-inquired-class' can be used to turn it on.

 - User Option: idlwave-support-inheritance (`t')
     Non-`nil' means, treat inheritance with completion, online help
     etc.

 - User Option: idlwave-completion-show-classes (`1')
     Non-`nil' means, show classes in `*Completions*' buffer when
     completing object methods and keywords.

 - User Option: idlwave-completion-fontify-classes (`t')
     Non-`nil' means, fontify the classes in completions buffer.

 - User Option: idlwave-query-class (`nil')
     Association list governing query for object classes during
     completion.

 - User Option: idlwave-store-inquired-class (`nil')
     Non-`nil' means, store class of a method call as text property on
     `->'.

 - User Option: idlwave-class-arrow-face
     Face to highlight object operator arrows `->' which carry a class
     text property.

Routine Source
==============

   Apart from clicking on a Source: line in the routine info window,
there is also another way to find the source file of a routine.  The
command `C-c C-v' (`idlwave-find-module') asks for a module name,
offering the same default as `idlwave-routine-info' would have used.
In the minibuffer, specify a complete routine name (including the class
part).  IDLWAVE will display the source file in another window.

   Since getting the source of a routine into a buffer is so easy with
IDLWAVE, too many buffers visiting different IDL source files are
sometimes created.  The special command `C-c C-k'
(`idlwave-kill-autoloaded-buffers') can be used to remove these buffers.


File: idlwave,  Node: Resolving Routines,  Next: Code Templates,  Prev: Routine Source,  Up: The IDLWAVE Major Mode

Resolving Routines
==================

   The key sequence `C-c =' calls the command `idlwave-resolve' and
sends the line `RESOLVE_ROUTINE, 'ROUTINE_NAME'' to IDL in order to
resolve (compile) it.  The default routine to be resolved is taken from
context, but you get a chance to edit it.

   `idlwave-resolve' is one way to get a library module within reach of
IDLWAVE's routine info collecting functions.  A better way is to scan
(parts of) the library (*note Library Catalog::).  Routine info on
library modules will then be available without the need to compile the
modules first, and even without a running shell.

   *Note Sources of Routine Info::, for in-depth information where
IDLWAVE collects data about routines, and how to update this
information.


File: idlwave,  Node: Code Templates,  Next: Actions,  Prev: Resolving Routines,  Up: The IDLWAVE Major Mode

Code Templates
==============

   IDLWAVE can insert IDL code templates into the buffer.  For a few
templates, this is done with direct key bindings:

`C-c C-c'   `CASE' statement template
`C-c C-f'   `FOR' loop template
`C-c C-r'   `REPEAT' loop template
`C-c C-w'   `WHILE' loop template

   Otherwise, special abbreviations are used.  Emacs abbreviations are
expanded by typing text into the buffer and pressing <SPC> or <RET>.
The special abbreviations used to insert code templates all start with
a `\' (the backslash).  Here are a few examples of predefined
abbreviations.   For a full list, use `M-x idlwave-list-abbrevs'.

`\pr'       `PROCEDURE' template
`\fu'       `FUNCTION' template
`\c'        `CASE' statement template
`\f'        `FOR' loop template
`\r'        `REPEAT' loop template
`\w'        `WHILE' loop template
`\i'        `IF' statement template
`\elif'     `IF-ELSE' statement template
`\b'        `BEGIN'

   The templates are expanded in upper or lower case, depending upon the
variables `idlwave-abbrev-change-case' and
`idlwave-reserved-word-upcase'.

 - User Option: idlwave-abbrev-start-char (`"\"')
     A single character string used to start abbreviations in abbrev
     mode.

 - User Option: idlwave-abbrev-move (`t')
     Non-`nil' means the abbrev hook can move point, e.g. to end up
     between the parenthesis of a function call.

   _Actions_ are special commands which are executed automatically
while you write code in order to check the structure of the program or
to enforce coding standards.  Most actions which have been implemented
in IDLWAVE are turned off by default, assuming that the average user
wants her code the way she writes it.  But if you are a lazy typist and
want your code to adhere to certain standards, they can be helpful.

   Action can be applied in three ways:

   * Some actions are applied directly while typing.  For example,
     pressing `=' can run a check to make sure that this operator is
     surrounded by spaces and insert these spaces if necessary.
     Pressing <SPC> after a reserved word can call a command to change
     the word to upper case.

   * When a line is re-indented with <TAB>, actions can be applied to
     the entire line.  To enable this, the variable `idlwave-do-actions'
     must be non-`nil'.

   * Action can also be applied to a larger piece of code, e.g. in
     order to convert foreign code to your own style.  To do this, mark
     the relevant part of the code and execute `M-x
     expand-region-abbrevs'.  Useful marking commands are `C-x h' (the
     entire file) or `M-C-h' (the current subprogram). *Note Code
     Indentation::, for information how to adjust the indentation of
     the code.

 - User Option: idlwave-do-actions (`nil')
     Non-`nil' means performs actions when indenting.

* Menu:

* Block Boundary Check::        Is the END correct
* Padding Operators::           Enforcing space around `=' etc
* Case Changes::                Enforcing upper case keywords


File: idlwave,  Node: Block Boundary Check,  Next: Padding Operators,  Prev: Actions,  Up: Actions

Block Boundary Check
--------------------

   Whenever you type an `END' statement, IDLWAVE finds the
corresponding start of the block and the cursor blinks back to that
location for a second.  If you have typed a specific `END', like
`ENDIF' or `ENDCASE', you get a warning if that kind of END does not
match the type of block it terminates.

   Set the variable `idlwave-expand-generic-end' in order to have all
generic `END' statements automatically expanded to a specific type.
You can also type `C-c ]' to close the current block by inserting the
appropriate `END' statement.

 - User Option: idlwave-show-block (`t')
     Non-`nil' means point blinks to block beginning for
     `idlwave-show-begin'.

 - User Option: idlwave-expand-generic-end (`t')
     Non-`nil' means expand generic END to ENDIF/ENDELSE/ENDWHILE etc.

 - User Option: idlwave-reindent-end (`t')
     Non-nil means re-indent line after END was typed.


File: idlwave,  Node: Padding Operators,  Next: Case Changes,  Prev: Block Boundary Check,  Up: Actions

Padding Operators
-----------------

   Some operators can be automatically surrounded by spaces.  This can
happen when the operator is typed, or also later when the line is
indented.  IDLWAVE contains this setting for the operators `&', `<',
`>', `,', `=', and `->'(1), but the feature is turned off by default.
If you want to turn it on, customize the variables
`idlwave-surround-by-blank' and `idlwave-do-actions'.  You can also
define similar actions for other operators by using the function
`idlwave-action-and-binding' in the mode hook.  For example, to enforce
space padding of the `+' and `*' operators, try this in `.emacs'

     (add-hook 'idlwave-mode-hook
       (lambda ()
          (setq idlwave-surround-by-blank t)  ; Turn this type of actions on
          (idlwave-action-and-binding "*" '(idlwave-surround 1 1))
          (idlwave-action-and-binding "+" '(idlwave-surround 1 1))))

 - User Option: idlwave-surround-by-blank (`nil')
     Non-`nil' means, enable `idlwave-surround'.  If non-nil, `=', `<',
     `>', `&', `,', `->' are surrounded with spaces by
     `idlwave-surround'.

 - User Option: idlwave-pad-keyword (`t')
     Non-`nil' means pad `=' for keywords like assignments.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Operators longer than one character can only be padded during
line indentation.


File: idlwave,  Node: Case Changes,  Prev: Padding Operators,  Up: Actions

Case Changes
------------

   Actions can be used to change the case of reserved words or expanded
abbreviations by customizing the variables `idlwave-abbrev-change-case'
and `idlwave-reserved-word-upcase'.  If you want to change the case of
additional words automatically, put something like the following into
your `.emacs' file:

     (add-hook 'idlwave-mode-hook
       (lambda ()
          ;;  Capitalize system vars
          (idlwave-action-and-binding idlwave-sysvar '(capitalize-word 1) t)
          ;;  Capitalize procedure name
          (idlwave-action-and-binding "\\<\\(pro\\|function\\)\\>[ \t]*\\<"
                                      '(capitalize-word 1) t)
          ;;  Capitalize common block name
          (idlwave-action-and-binding "\\<common\\>[ \t]+\\<"
                                      '(capitalize-word 1) t)))

   For more information, see the documentation string for the function
`idlwave-action-and-binding'.

 - User Option: idlwave-abbrev-change-case (`nil')
     Non-`nil' means all abbrevs will be forced to either upper or lower
     case.  Legal values are `nil', `t', and `down'.

 - User Option: idlwave-reserved-word-upcase (`nil')
     Non-`nil' means, reserved words will be made upper case via abbrev
     expansion.

Documentation Header
====================

   The command `C-c C-h' inserts a standard routine header into the
buffer, with the usual fields for documentation.  One of the keywords is
`MODIFICATION HISTORY' under which the changes to a routine can be
recorded.  The command `C-c C-m' jumps to the `MODIFICATION HISTORY' of
the current routine or file and inserts the user name with a timestamp.

 - User Option: idlwave-file-header

Motion Commands
===============

   IDLWAVE supports both `Imenu' and `Func-menu', two packages which
make it easy to jump to the definitions of functions and procedures in
the current file.

   Several commands allow to move quickly through the structure of an
IDL program.  These are

`C-M-a'     Beginning of subprogram
`C-M-e'     End of subprogram
`C-c {'     Beginning of block (stay inside the block)
`C-c }'     End of block (stay inside the block)
`M-C-n'     Forward block (on same level)
`M-C-p'     Backward block (on same level)
`M-C-d'     Down block (enters a block)
`M-C-u'     Backward up block (leaves a block)

The IDLWAVE Shell
*****************

   The IDLWAVE shell is an Emacs major mode which allows to run the IDL
program as an inferior process of Emacs.  It can be used to work with
IDL interactively, to compile and run IDL programs in Emacs buffers and
to debug these programs.  The IDLWAVE shell uses `comint', an Emacs
packages which handles the communication with the IDL program.
Unfortunately IDL for Windows and MacOS does not allow the interaction
with Emacs(1), so the IDLWAVE shell only works under GNU and Unix.

* Menu:

* Starting the Shell::          How to launch IDL as a subprocess
* Using the Shell::             Interactively working with the Shell
* Debugging IDL Programs::      Compilation/Debugging

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Please inform the maintainer if you come up with a way to make
the IDLWAVE shell work on these systems.


File: idlwave,  Node: Starting the Shell,  Next: Using the Shell,  Prev: The IDLWAVE Shell,  Up: The IDLWAVE Shell

Starting the Shell
==================

   The IDLWAVE shell can be started with the command `M-x
idlwave-shell'.  In `idlwave-mode' the function is bound to `C-c C-s'.
It creates a buffer `*idl*' which is used to interact with the shell.
If the shell is already running, `C-c C-s' will simple switch to the
shell buffer.  The command `C-c C-l'
(`idlwave-shell-recenter-shell-window') displays the shell window
without selecting it.

   In order to create a separate frame for the IDLWAVE shell buffer,
call `idlwave-shell' with a prefix argument: `C-u C-c C-s' or `C-u C-c
C-l'.  If you always want a dedicated frame for the shell window,
configure the variable `idlwave-shell-use-dedicated-frame'.

   The shell can also be started automatically when another command
tries to send a command to it.  To enable auto start, set the variable
`idlwave-shell-automatic-start' to `t'.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-explicit-file-name
     This is the command to run IDL.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-command-line-options
     A list of command line options for calling the IDL program.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-prompt-pattern
     Regexp to match IDL prompt at beginning of a line.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-process-name
     Name to be associated with the IDL process.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-automatic-start
     Non-`nil' means attempt to invoke idlwave-shell if not already
     running.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-initial-commands
     Initial commands, separated by newlines, to send to IDL.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-use-dedicated-frame (`nil')
     Non-`nil' means, IDLWAVE should use a special frame to display
     shell buffer.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-frame-parameters
     The frame parameters for a dedicated idlwave-shell frame.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-temp-pro-prefix
     The prefix for temporary IDL files used when compiling regions.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-mode-hook
     Hook for customizing `idlwave-shell-mode'.

Using the Shell
===============

   The IDLWAVE shell works in the same fashion as other shell modes in
Emacs.  It provides command history, command line editing and job
control.  The <UP> and <DOWN> arrows cycle through the input history
just like in an X terminal(1).  Here is a list of commonly used
commands.

<UP>      Cycle backwards in input history
<DOWN>    Cycle forwards in input history
`M-p'     Cycle backwards in input history _matching input_
`M-n'     Cycle forwards in input history _matching input_
`M-r'     Previous input matching a regexp
`M-s'     Next input that matches a regexp
`return'  Send input or copy line to current prompt
`C-c C-a' Beginning of line; skip prompt
`C-c C-u' Kill input to beginning of line
`C-c C-w' Kill word before cursor
`C-c C-c' Send ^C
`C-c C-z' Send ^Z
`C-c C-\' Send ^\
`C-c C-o' Delete last batch of process output
`C-c C-r' Show last batch of process output
`C-c C-l' List input history

   In addition to these standard `comint' commands,
`idlwave-shell-mode' provides many of the commands which simplify
writing IDL code, including abbreviations, online help, and completion.
See *Note Routine Info:: and *Note Online Help:: and *Note Completion::
for more information on these commands.

`<TAB>'   Completion of file names, routine names and keywords
          (`idlwave-shell-complete')
`M-<TAB>' Same as <TAB>
`C-c ?'   Routine Info display (`idlwave-routine-info')
`M-?'     IDL online help on routine
          (`idlwave-routine-info-from-idlhelp')
`C-c C-i' Update routine info from buffers and shell
          (`idlwave-update-routine-info')
`C-c C-v' Find the source file of a routine (`idlwave-find-module')
`C-c ='   Compile a library routine (`idlwave-resolve')

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-arrows-do-history (`t')
     Non-`nil' means <UP> and <DOWN> arrows move through command
     history like xterm.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-file-name-chars
     The characters allowed in file names, as a string.  Used for file
     name completion.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-graphics-window-size
     Size of IDL graphics windows popped up by special IDLWAVE command.

   IDLWAVE works in line input mode: You compose a full command line,
using all the power Emacs gives you to do this.  When you press <RET>,
the whole line is sent to IDL.  Sometimes it is necessary to send single
characters (without a newline), for example when an IDL program is
waiting for single character input with the `GET_KBRD' function.  You
can send a single character to IDL with the command `C-c C-x'
(`idlwave-shell-send-char').  When you press `C-c C-y'
(`idlwave-shell-char-mode-loop'), IDLWAVE runs a blocking loop which
accepts characters and immediately sends them to IDL.  The loop can be
exited with `C-g'.  It terminates also automatically when the current
IDL command is finished.  Check the documentation of the two variables
described below for a way to make IDL programs trigger automatic
switches of the input mode.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-use-input-mode-magic (`nil')
     Non-nil means, IDLWAVE should check for input mode spells in
     output.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-input-mode-spells
     The three regular expressions which match the magic spells for
     input modes.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This is different from normal Emacs/Comint behavior, but more
like an xterm.  If you prefer the default comint functionality, check
the variable `idlwave-shell-arrows-do-history'.


File: idlwave,  Node: Debugging IDL Programs,  Prev: Using the Shell,  Up: The IDLWAVE Shell

Debugging IDL Programs
======================

   Programs can be compiled, run, and debugged directly from the source
buffer in Emacs.  The IDLWAVE shell installs key bindings both in the
shell buffer and in all IDL code buffers of the current Emacs session.
On Emacs versions which support this, it also installs a debugging
toolbar.  The display of the toolbar can be toggled with `C-c C-d C-t'
(`idlwave-shell-toggle-toolbar').

   The debugging key bindings are by default on the prefix key `C-c
C-d', so for example setting a breakpoint is done with `C-c C-d C-b',
compiling a source file with `C-c C-d C-c'.  If you find this too much
work you can choose a combination of modifier keys which is not used by
other commands.  For example, if you write in `.emacs'

     (setq idlwave-shell-debug-modifiers '(control shift))

   a breakpoint can be set by pressing `b' while holding down `shift'
and `control' keys, i.e. `C-S-b'.  Compiling a source file will be on
`C-S-c', deleting a breakpoint `C-S-d' etc.  In the remainder of this
chapter we will assume that the `C-c C-d' bindings are active, but each
of these bindings will have an equivalent single-keypress shortcut with
the modifiers given in the `idlwave-shell-debug-modifiers' variable.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-prefix-key (`C-c C-d')
     The prefix key for the debugging map
     `idlwave-shell-mode-prefix-map'.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-activate-prefix-keybindings (`t')
     Non-`nil' means, debug commands will be bound to the prefix key,
     like `C-c C-d C-b'.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-debug-modifiers (`nil')
     List of modifier keys to use for binding debugging commands in the
     shell and in source buffers.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-use-toolbar (`t')
     Non-`nil' means, use the debugging toolbar in all IDL related
     buffers.

* Menu:

* Compiling Programs::          Compiling buffers under the shell
* Breakpoints and Stepping::    Deciding where to stop and look
* Examining Variables::         What is the value now?


File: idlwave,  Node: Compiling Programs,  Next: Breakpoints and Stepping,  Prev: Debugging IDL Programs,  Up: Debugging IDL Programs

Compiling Programs
------------------

   In order to compile the current buffer under the IDLWAVE shell, press
`C-c C-d C-c' (`idlwave-save-and-run').  This first saves the current
buffer and then send the command `.run path/to/file' to the shell.  You
can also execute `C-c C-d C-c' from the shell buffer, in which case the
most recently compiled buffer will be saved and re-compiled.

   When developing or debugging a program, it is often necessary to
execute the same command line many times.  A convenient way to do this
is `C-c C-d C-y' (`idlwave-shell-execute-default-command-line').  This
command first resets IDL from a state of interrupted execution by
closing all files and returning to the main interpreter level.  Then a
default command line is send to the shell.  To edit the default command
line, call `idlwave-shell-execute-default-command-line' with a prefix
argument: `C-u C-c C-d C-y'.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-mark-stop-line (`t')
     Non-`nil' means, mark the source code line where IDL is currently
     stopped.  The value decides about the preferred method.  Legal
     values are `nil', `t', `arrow', and `face'.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-overlay-arrow (`">"')
     The overlay arrow to display at source lines where execution halts.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-stop-line-face
     The face which highlights the source line where IDL is stopped.


File: idlwave,  Node: Breakpoints and Stepping,  Next: Examining Variables,  Prev: Compiling Programs,  Up: Debugging IDL Programs

Breakpoints and Stepping
------------------------

   You can set breakpoints and step through a program with IDLWAVE.
Setting a breakpoint in the current line of the source buffer is done
with `C-c C-d C-b' (`idlwave-shell-break-here').  With a prefix arg of
1, the breakpoint gets a `/ONCE' keyword, meaning that it will be
deleted after first use.  With a numeric prefix greater than one, the
breakpoint will only be active the `nth' time it is hit.  To clear the
breakpoint in the current line, use `C-c C-d C-d'
(`idlwave-clear-current-bp').  To clear all breakpoints, use `C-c C-d
C-a' (`idlwave-clear-all-bp').  Breakpoint lines are highlighted in the
source code.

   Once the program has stopped somewhere, you can step through it.
Here is a summary of the breakpoint and stepping commands:

`C-c C-d C-b'     Set breakpoint (`idlwave-shell-break-here')
`C-c C-d C-i'     Set breakpoint in function named here
                  (`idlwave-shell-break-in')
`C-c C-d C-d'     Clear current breakpoint
                  (`idlwave-shell-clear-current-bp')
`C-c C-d C-a'     Clear all breakpoints (`idlwave-shell-clear-all-bp')
`C-c C-d C-s'     Step, into function calls (`idlwave-shell-step')
`C-c C-d C-n'     Step, over function calls (`idlwave-shell-stepover')
`C-c C-d C-k'     Skip one statement (`idlwave-shell-skip')
`C-c C-d C-u'     Continue to end of block (`idlwave-shell-up')
`C-c C-d C-m'     Continue to end of function (`idlwave-shell-return')
`C-c C-d C-o'     Continue past end of function (`idlwave-shell-out')
`C-c C-d C-h'     Continue to line at cursor position
                  (`idlwave-shell-to-here')
`C-c C-d C-r'     Continue execution to next breakpoint
                  (`idlwave-shell-cont')
`C-c C-d C-up'    Show higher level in calling stack
                  (`idlwave-shell-stack-up')
`C-c C-d C-down'  Show lower level in calling stack
                  (`idlwave-shell-stack-down')

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-mark-breakpoints (`t')
     Non-`nil' means, mark breakpoints in the source file buffers.  The
     value indicates the preferred method.  Legal values are `nil',
     `t', `face', and `glyph'.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-breakpoint-face
     The face for breakpoint lines in the source code if
     `idlwave-shell-mark-breakpoints' has the value `face'.


File: idlwave,  Node: Examining Variables,  Prev: Breakpoints and Stepping,  Up: Debugging IDL Programs

Examining Variables
-------------------

   When execution is stopped you can examine the values of variables.
The command `C-c C-d C-p' prints the expression at point, while `C-c
C-d ?' shows help on this expression.  The expression at point is an
array expression or a function call, or the contents of a pair of
parenthesis.  The selected expression becomes highlighted in the source
code for a short time.  Calling the above commands with a prefix
argument will prompt for an expression instead of using the one at
point.

   It is very convenient to click with the mouse on expressions to
retrieve their value.  Expression printing is also bound to `S-Mouse-2'
and expression help to `C-S-Mouse-2'.  I.e. you need to hold down
<SHIFT> and <CONTROL> while clicking with the mouse.

   Printing of expressions also works on higher levels of the calling
stack.  This means that you can examine the values of variables and
expressions inside the routine which called the current routine etc.
Use the commands `C-c C-d C-<UP>' (`idlwave-shell-stack-up') and `C-c
C-d C-<DOWN>' (`idlwave-shell-stack-down') or the corresponding toolbar
buttons to move through the calling stack.  The mode line of the shell
window will indicate the routine and the calling stack level which
define the context for printing expressions.  The following
restrictions apply for all levels except the current:

   * Array expressions must use the `[ ]' index delimiters.  Identifiers
     with a `( )' will be interpreted as function calls.

   * Printing values of expressions on higher levels of the calling
     stack uses the _unsupported_ IDL routine `ROUTINE_NAMES', which may
     or may not be available in future versions of IDL.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-expression-face
     The face for `idlwave-shell-expression-overlay'.  Allows you to
     choose the font, color and other properties for the expression
     printed by IDL.

 - User Option: idlwave-shell-print-expression-function (`nil')
     A function to handle special display of evaluated expressions.

Installing IDLWAVE
==================

   IDLWAVE is part of Emacs 21.1 and later.  It is also an XEmacs
package and can be installed from the XEmacs ftp site
(ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/packages/) with the normal package
management system on XEmacs 21.  These pre-installed versions should
work out-of-the-box.  However, the files needed for online help are not
distributed with XEmacs/Emacs and have to be installed separately(1)
(*note Installing Online Help::).

   You can also download IDLWAVE and install it yourself from the
maintainers webpage
(http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~dominik/Tools/idlwave).  Follow the
instructions in the INSTALL file.

Installing Online Help
======================

   If you want to use the online help display, two additional files (an
ASCII version of the IDL documentation and a topics/code file) must be
installed.  These files can also be downloaded from the maintainers
webpage (http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~dominik/Tools/idlwave).  You
need to place the files somewhere on your system and tell IDLWAVE where
they are with

Upgrading from the old `idl.el' file
====================================

   If you have been using the old `idl.el' and `idl-shell.el' files and
would like to use IDLWAVE, you need to update your customization in
`.emacs'.

  1. Change all variable and function prefixes from `idl-' to
     `idlwave-'.

  2. Remove the now invalid `autoload' and `auto-mode-alist' forms
     pointing to the `idl.el' and `idl-shell.el' files.  Install the
     new autoload forms.

  3. If you have been using the hook function recommended in earlier
     versions to get a separate frame for the IDL shell, remove that
     command from your `idlwave-shell-mode-hook'.  Instead, set the
     variable `idlwave-shell-use-dedicated-frame' with
          (setq idlwave-shell-use-dedicated-frame t)

  4. The key sequence `M-<TAB>' no longer inserts a TAB character.
     Like in many other Emacs modes, `M-<TAB>' now does completion.
     Inserting a TAB has therefore been moved to `C-<TAB>'.  On a
     character based terminal you can also use `C-c <SPC>'.

Sources of Routine Info
***********************

   In *Note Routine Info:: and *Note Completion:: it was shown how
IDLWAVE displays the calling sequence and keywords of routines, and how
it completes routine names and keywords.  For these features to work,
IDLWAVE must know about the accessible routines.

* Menu:

Routine Definitions
===================

   Routines which can be used in an IDL program can be defined in
several places:

  1. _Builtin routines_ are defined inside IDL itself.  The source code
     of such routines is not accessible to the user.

  2. Routines _part of the current program_ are defined in a file which
     is explicitly compiled by the user.  This file may or may not be
     located on the IDL search path.

  3. _Library routines_ are defined in special files which are located
     somewhere on IDL's search path.  When a library routine is called
     for the first time, IDL will find the source file and compile it
     dynamically.

  4. External routines written in other languages (like Fortran or C)
     can be called with `CALL_EXTERNAL', linked into IDL via
     `LINKIMAGE', or included as dynamically loaded modules (DLMs).
     Currently IDLWAVE cannot provide routine info and completion for
     external routines.


File: idlwave,  Node: Routine Information Sources,  Next: Library Catalog,  Prev: Routine Definitions,  Up: Sources of Routine Info

Routine Information Sources
===========================

   In oder to know about as many routines as possible, IDLWAVE will do
the following to collect information:

  1. It has a _builtin list_ with the properties of the builtin IDL
     routines.  IDLWAVE 4.7 is distributed with a list of 1287 routines
     and 5724 keywords, reflecting IDL version 5.4.  This list has been
     created by scanning the IDL manuals and is stored in the file
     `idlw-rinfo.el'.  *Note Documentation Scan::, for information how
     to regenerate this file for new versions of IDL.

  2. It _scans_ all _buffers_ of the current Emacs session for routine
     definitions.  This is done automatically when routine information
     or completion is first requested by the user.  Each new buffer and
     each buffer which is saved after making changes is also scanned.
     The command `C-c C-i' (`idlwave-update-routine-info') can be used
     at any time to rescan all buffers.

  3. If you have an IDLWAVE-Shell running as inferior process of the
     current Emacs session, IDLWAVE will _query the shell_ for compiled
     routines and their arguments.  This happens automatically when
     routine information or completion is first requested by the user,
     and each time an Emacs buffer is compiled with `C-c C-d C-c'.  The
     command `C-c C-i' (`idlwave-update-routine-info') can be used to
     ask the shell again at any time.

  4. IDLWAVE can scan all or selected library files and store the
     result in a file which will be automatically loaded just like
     `idlw-rinfo.el'. *Note Library Catalog::, for information how to
     scan library files.

 - User Option: idlwave-scan-all-buffers-for-routine-info (`t')
     Non-`nil' means, scan all buffers for IDL programs when updating
     info.

 - User Option: idlwave-query-shell-for-routine-info (`t')
     Non-`nil' means query the shell for info about compiled routines.

 - User Option: idlwave-auto-routine-info-updates
     Controls under what circumstances routine info is updated
     automatically.


File: idlwave,  Node: Library Catalog,  Next: Load-Path Shadows,  Prev: Routine Information Sources,  Up: Sources of Routine Info

Library Catalog
===============

   IDLWAVE can extract routine information from library modules and
store that information in a file.  To do this, the variable
`idlwave-libinfo-file' needs to contain the path to a file in an
existing directory (the default is `"~/.idlcat.el"').  Since the file
will contain lisp code, its name should end in `.el'.  Under Windows
and MacOS, you also need to specify the search path for IDL library
files in the variable `idlwave-library-path', and the location of the
IDL directory (the value of the `!DIR' system variable) in the variable
`idlwave-system-directory'.  Under Unix and GNU, these values will be
automatically inferred from an IDLWAVE shell.

   The command `M-x idlwave-create-libinfo-file' can then be used to
scan library files.  It brings up a widget in which you can select some
or all directories on the search path.  If you only want to have routine
and completion info of some libraries, it is sufficient to scan those
directories.  However, if you want IDLWAVE to detect possible name
conflicts with routines defined in other libraries, the whole pass
should be scanned.

   After selecting directories, click on the `[Scan & Save]' button in
the widget to scan all files in the selected directories and write the
resulting routine information into the file `idlwave-libinfo-file'.  In
order to update the library information from the same directories, call
the command `idlwave-update-routine-info' with a double prefix argument:
`C-u C-u C-c C-i'.  This will rescan files in the previously selected
directories, write an updated version of the libinfo file and rebuild
IDLWAVEs internal lists.

   A note of caution:  Depending on your local installation, the IDL
library can be very large.  Parsing it for routine information will take
time and loading this information into Emacs can require a significant
amount of memory.  However, having this information available will be a
great help.

 - User Option: idlwave-libinfo-file
     File for routine information of the IDL library.

 - User Option: idlwave-library-path
     IDL library path for Windows and MacOS.  Not needed under GNU and
     Unix.

 - User Option: idlwave-system-directory
     The IDL system directory for Windows and MacOS.  Not needed under
     GNU and Unix.

 - User Option: idlwave-special-lib-alist
     Alist of regular expressions matching special library directories.


File: idlwave,  Node: Load-Path Shadows,  Next: Documentation Scan,  Prev: Library Catalog,  Up: Sources of Routine Info

Load-Path Shadows
=================

   IDLWAVE can compile a list of routines which are defined in several
different files.  Since one definition will hide (shadow) the others
depending on which file is compiled first, such multiple definitions are
called "load-path shadows".  IDLWAVE has several routines to scan for
load path shadows.  The output is placed into the special buffer
`*Shadows*'.  The format of the output is identical to the source
section of the routine info buffer (*note Routine Info::).  The
different definitions of a routine are listed in the sequence of
_likelyhood of use_.  So the first entry will be most likely the one
you'll get if an unsuspecting command uses that routine.  Before
listing shadows, you should make sure that routine info is up-to-date by
pressing `C-c C-i'.  Here are the different routines:

`M-x idlwave-list-buffer-load-path-shadows'
     This commands checks the names of all routines defined in the
     current buffer for shadowing conflicts with other routines
     accessible to IDLWAVE.  The command also has a key binding: `C-c
     C-b'

`M-x idlwave-list-shell-load-path-shadows'.
     Checks all routines compiled under the shell for shadowing.  This
     is very useful when you have written a complete application.  Just
     compile the application, use `RESOLVE_ALL' to compile any routines
     used by your code, update the routine info inside IDLWAVE with
     `C-c C-i' and then check for shadowing.

`M-x idlwave-list-all-load-path-shadows'
     This command checks all routines accessible to IDLWAVE for
     conflicts.

   For these commands to work properly you should have scanned the
entire load path, not just selected directories.  Also, IDLWAVE should
be able to distinguish between the system library files (normally
installed in `/usr/local/rsi/idl/lib') and any site specific or user
specific files.  Therefore, such local files should not be installed
inside the `lib' directory of the IDL directory.  This is of course
also advisable for many other reasons.

   Users of Windows and MacOS also must set the variable
`idlwave-system-directory' to the value of the `!DIR' system variable
in IDL.  IDLWAVE appends `lib' to the value of this variable and
assumes that all files found on that path are system routines.

   Another way to find out if a specific routine has multiple
definitions on the load path is routine info display (*note Routine
Info::).


File: idlwave,  Node: Documentation Scan,  Prev: Load-Path Shadows,  Up: Sources of Routine Info

Documentation Scan
==================

   IDLWAVE derives it knowledge about system routines from the IDL
manuals.  The file `idlw-rinfo.el' contains the routine information for
the IDL system routines.  The Online Help feature of IDLWAVE requires
ASCII versions of some IDL manuals to be available in a specific format
(`idlw-help.txt'), along with an Emacs-Lisp file `idlw-help.el' with
supporting code and pointers to the ASCII file.

   All 3 files can be derived from the IDL documentation.  If you are
lucky, the maintainer of IDLWAVE will always have access to the newest
version of IDL and provide updates.  The IDLWAVE distribution also
contains the Perl program `get_rinfo' which constructs these files by
scanning selected files from the IDL documentation.  Instructions on
how to use `get_rinfo' are in the program itself.

Configuration Examples
**********************

Question: So now you have all these complicated configuration options
in your package, but which ones do _you_ as the maintainer actually set
in your own configuration?

Answer: Hardly any.  As the maintainer, I set the default of most
options to what I think is best.  However, the default settings do not
turn on features which

   - are not self-evident (i.e. too magic) when used by an unsuspecting
     user

   - are too intrusive

   - will not work properly on all Emacs installations out there

   - break with widely used standards.

To see what I mean, here is the _entire_ configuration I have in my
`.emacs':

     (setq idlwave-shell-debug-modifiers '(control shift)
           idlwave-store-inquired-class t
           idlwave-shell-automatic-start t
           idlwave-main-block-indent 2
           idlwave-help-dir "~/lib/emacs/idlwave"
           idlwave-special-lib-alist '(("/idl-astro/" . "AstroLib")
                                       ("/jhuapl/" . "JHUAPL-Lib")
                                       ("/dominik/lib/idl/" . "MyLib")))

   However, if you are an Emacs power-user and want IDLWAVE to work
completely differently, the options allow you to change almost every
aspect of it.  Here is an example of a much more extensive configuration
of IDLWAVE.  To say it again - this is not what I recommend, but the
user is King!

     ;;; Settings for IDLWAVE mode
     
     (setq idlwave-block-indent 3)           ; Indentation settings
     (setq idlwave-main-block-indent 3)

         (idlwave-auto-fill-mode 0)           ; Turn off auto filling
         ;;
         ;; Pad with 1 space (if -n is used then make the
         ;; padding a minimum of n spaces.)  The defaults use -1
         ;; instead of 1.

         (idlwave-action-and-binding "<" '(idlwave-surround 1 1))
         (idlwave-action-and-binding ">" '(idlwave-surround 1 1 '(?-)))
         (idlwave-action-and-binding "&" '(idlwave-surround 1 1))
         ;;
         ;; Only pad after comma and with exactly 1 space
         (idlwave-action-and-binding "," '(idlwave-surround nil 1))
         (idlwave-action-and-binding "&" '(idlwave-surround 1 1))
         ;;
         ;; Pad only after `->', remove any space before the arrow
         (idlwave-action-and-binding "->"  '(idlwave-surround 0 -1 nil 2))
         ;;;
         ;; Set some personal bindings

         (local-set-key "," 'self-insert-command)

         ))
