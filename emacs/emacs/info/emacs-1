Distribution
************

   GNU Emacs is "free software"; this means that everyone is free to
use it and free to redistribute it on certain conditions.  GNU Emacs is
not in the public domain; it is copyrighted and there are restrictions
on its distribution, but these restrictions are designed to permit
everything that a good cooperating citizen would want to do.  What is
not allowed is to try to prevent others from further sharing any version
of GNU Emacs that they might get from you.  The precise conditions are
found in the GNU General Public License that comes with Emacs and also
appears following this section.

   One way to get a copy of GNU Emacs is from someone else who has it.
You need not ask for our permission to do so, or tell any one else; just
copy it.  If you have access to the Internet, you can get the latest
distribution version of GNU Emacs by anonymous FTP; see the file
`etc/FTP' in the Emacs distribution for more information.

   You may also receive GNU Emacs when you buy a computer.  Computer
manufacturers are free to distribute copies on the same terms that
apply to everyone else.  These terms require them to give you the full
sources, including whatever changes they may have made, and to permit
you to redistribute the GNU Emacs received from them under the usual
terms of the General Public License.  In other words, the program must
be free for you when you get it, not just free for the manufacturer.

   You can also order copies of GNU Emacs from the Free Software
Foundation on CD-ROM.  This is a convenient and reliable way to get a
copy; it is also a good way to help fund our work.  (The Foundation has
always received most of its funds in this way.)  An order form is
included in the file `etc/ORDERS' in the Emacs distribution, and on our
web site in <http://www.gnu.org/order/order.html>.  For further
information, write to

     Free Software Foundation
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330
     Boston, MA  02111-1307 USA
     USA

   The income from distribution fees goes to support the foundation's
purpose: the development of new free software, and improvements to our
existing programs including GNU Emacs.

   If you find GNU Emacs useful, please *send a donation* to the Free
Software Foundation to support our work.  Donations to the Free
Software Foundation are tax deductible in the US.  If you use GNU Emacs
at your workplace, please suggest that the company make a donation.  If
company policy is unsympathetic to the idea of donating to charity, you
might instead suggest ordering a CD-ROM from the Foundation
occasionally, or subscribing to periodic updates.
