Viper Specials
==============

   Viper extends Vi with a number of useful features.  This includes
various search functions, histories of search strings, Ex commands,
insertions, and Vi's destructive commands.  In addition, Viper supports
file name completion and history, completion of Ex commands and
variables, and many other features.  Some of these features are
explained in detail elsewhere in this document.  Other features are
explained here.

`(viper-buffer-search-enable)'

`viper-buffer-search-char nil'
     Enable buffer search.  Explicit call to
     `viper-buffer-search-enable' sets `viper-buffer-search-char' to
     `g'.  Alternatively, the user can set `viper-buffer-search-char'
     in `.viper' to a key sequence to be used for buffer search.  There
     is no need to call `viper-buffer-search-enable' in that case.

`viper-toggle-search-style'
     This function, bound to `C-c /', lets one toggle case-sensitive and
     case-insensitive search, and also switch between plain vanilla
     search and search via regular expressions.  Without the prefix
     argument, the user is asked which mode to toggle.  With prefix
     argument 1, this toggles case-sensitivity.  With prefix argument
     2, regular expression/vanilla search will be toggled.

     However, we found that the most convenient way to toggle these
     options is to bind a Vi macro to bind `//' to toggles case
     sensitivity and to `///' to toggles vanilla search.  Thus, quickly
     hitting `/' twice will switch Viper from case sensitive search to
     case-insensitive.  Repeating this once again will restore the
     original state.  Likewise, quickly hitting `/' three times will
     switch you from vanilla-style search to search via regular
     expressions.  If you hit something other than `/' after the first
     `/' or if the second `/' doesn't follow quickly enough, then Viper
     will issue the usual prompt `/' and will wait for input, as usual
     in Vi.  If you don't like this behavior, you can "unrecord" these
     macros in your `~/.viper' file.  For instance, if you don't like
     the above feature, put this in `~/.viper':
          (viper-set-searchstyle-toggling-macros 'undefine)

`Vi-isms in Emacs state'
     Some people find it useful to use the Vi-style search key, `/', to
     invoke search in modes which Viper leaves in emacs-state.  These
     modes are: `dired-mode', `mh-folder-mode', `gnus-group-mode',
     `gnus-summary-mode', `Info-mode', and `Buffer-menu-mode' (more may
     be added in the future).  So, in the above modes, Viper binds `/'
     so that it will behave Vi-style.  Furthermore, in those major
     modes, Viper binds `:' to invoke ex-style commands, like in
     vi-state.  And, as described above, `//' and `///' get bound to
     Vi-style macros that toggle case-insensitivity and regexp-search.

     If you don't like these features--which I don't really
     understand--you can unbind `/' and `:' in
     `viper-dired-modifier-map' (for Dired) or in
     `viper-slash-and-colon-map', for other modes.

     To unbind the macros `//' and `///' for a major mode where you
     feel they are undesirable, execute
     `viper-set-emacs-state-searchstyle-macros' with a non-nil
     argument.  This can be done either interactively, by supplying a
     prefix argument, or by placing
          (viper-set-emacs-state-searchstyle-macros 'undefine)
     in the hook to the major mode (e.g., `dired-mode-hook').  *Note Vi
     Macros::, for more information on Vi macros.

`viper-heading-start'

`viper-heading-end'
     Regular Expressions for `[[' and `]]'.  Note that Emacs defines
     Regexps for paragraphs and sentences.  *Note Paragraphs and
     Sentences: (emacs)Paragraphs, for details.

`M-x viper-set-expert-level'
     Change your user level interactively.

`viper-smart-suffix-list  '("" "tex" "c" "cc" "el" "p")'
     Viper supports Emacs-style file completion when it prompts the
     user for a file name.  However, in many cases, the same directory
     may contain files with identical prefix but different suffixes,
     e.g., prog.c, prog.o, paper.tex, paper.dvi.  In such cases,
     completion will stop at the `.'.  If the above variable is a list
     of strings representing suffixes, Viper will try these suffixes in
     the order listed and will check if the corresponding file exists.

     For instance, if completion stopped at `paper.' and the user typed
     <RET>, then Viper will check if the files `paper.', `paper.tex',
     `paper.c', etc., exist.  It will take the first such file.  If no
     file exists, Viper will give a chance to complete the file name by
     typing the appropriate suffix.  If `paper.' was the intended file
     name, hitting return will accept it.

     To turn this feature off, set the above variable to `nil'.

`viper-insertion-ring-size  14'
     Viper remembers what was previously inserted in Insert and Replace
     states.  Several such recent insertions are kept in a special ring
     of strings of size `viper-insertion-ring-size'.  If you enter
     Insert or Replace state you can reinsert strings from this ring by
     typing `C-c M-p' or `C-c M-n'.  The former will search the ring in
     the direction of older insertions, and the latter will search in
     the direction of newer insertions.  Hitting `C-c M-p' or `C-c M-n'
     in succession will undo the previous insertion from the ring and
     insert the next item on the ring.  If a larger ring size is
     needed, change the value of the above variable in the `~/.viper'
     file.

     Since typing these sequences of keys may be tedious, it is
     suggested that the user should bind a function key, such as `f31',
     as follows:
          (define-key viper-insert-global-user-map [f31]
                      'viper-insert-prev-from-insertion-ring)
     This binds `f31' (which is usually `R11' on a Sun workstation) to
     the function that inserts the previous string in the insertion
     history.  To rotate the history in the opposite direction, you can
     either bind an unused key to
     `viper-insert-next-from-insertion-ring' or hit any digit (1 to 9)
     then `f31'.

     One should not bind the above functions to `M-p' or `M-n', since
     this will interfere with the Minibuffer histories and, possibly,
     other major modes.

`viper-command-ring-size  14'
     Viper keeps track of the recent history of destructive commands,
     such as `dw', `i', etc.  In Vi state, the most recent command can
     be re-executed by hitting ``.'', as in Vi.  However, repeated
     typing `C-c M-p' will cause Viper to show the previous destructive
     commands in the minibuffer.  Subsequent hitting ``.'' will execute
     the command that was displayed last.  The key `C-c M-n' will cycle
     through the command history in the opposite direction.  Since
     typing `C-c M-p' may be tedious, it is more convenient to bind an
     appropriate function to an unused function key on the keyboard and
     use that key.  For instance, the following
          (define-key viper-vi-global-user-map [f31]
                      'viper-prev-destructive-command)
     binds the key `f31' (which is usually `R11' on a Sun workstation)
     to the function that searches the command history in the direction
     of older commands.  To search in the opposite direction, you can
     either bind an unused key to `viper-next-destructive-command' or
     hit any digit (1 to 9) then `f31'.

     One should not bind the above functions to `M-p' or `M-n', since
     this will interfere with the Minibuffer histories and, possibly,
     other major modes.

`viper-minibuffer-vi-face  'viper-minibuffer-vi-face'

`viper-minibuffer-insert-face  'viper-minibuffer-insert-face'

`viper-minibuffer-emacs-face  'viper-minibuffer-emacs-face'
     These faces control the appearance of the minibuffer text in the
     corresponding Viper states.  You can change the appearance of
     these faces through Emacs' customization widget, which is
     accessible through the menubar.

     Viper is located in this widget under the _Emulations_
     customization subgroup of the _Editing_ group.  All Viper faces
     are grouped together in Viper's _Highlighting_ customization
     subgroup.

     Note that only the text you type in is affected by the above faces.
     Prompts and Minibuffer messages are not affected.

     Purists who do not like adornments in the minibuffer can always
     zap them by putting
          (copy-face 'default 'viper-minibuffer-vi-face)
          (copy-face 'default 'viper-minibuffer-insert-face)
          (copy-face 'default 'viper-minibuffer-emacs-face)
     in the `~/.viper' file or through the customization widget, as
     described above.  However, in that case, the user will not have any
     indication of the current Viper state in the minibuffer.  (This is
     important if the user accidentally switches to another Viper state
     by typing <ESC> or `C-z').

`M-x viper-go-away'
     Make Viper disappear from the face of your running Emacs instance.
     If your fingers start aching again, `M-x viper-mode' might save
     your day.

`M-x toggle-viper-mode'
     Toggle Viperization of Emacs on and off.

   Viper provides some support for multi-file documents and programs.
If a document consists of several files we can designate one of them as
a master and put the following at the end of that file:
     ;;; Local Variables:
     ;;; eval: (viper-setup-master-buffer "file1" "file2" "file3" "file4")
     ;;; End:

where `file1' to `file4' are names of files related to the master file.
Next time, when the master file is visited, the command
`viper-setup-master-buffer' will be evaluated and the above files will
be associated with the master file.  Then, the new Ex command
`:RelatedFile' (abbr. `:R') will display files 1 to 4 one after
another, so you can edit them.  If a file is not in any Emacs buffer, it
will be visited.  The command `PreviousRelatedFile' (abbr., `:P') goes
through the file list in the opposite direction.

   These commands are akin to `:n' and `:N', but they allow the user to
focus on relevant files only.

   Note that only the master file needs to have the aforementioned
block of commands.  Also, ";;;" above can be replaced by some other
markers.  Semicolon is good for Lisp programs, since it is considered a
comment designator there.  For LaTeX, this could be "%%%", and for C the
above block should be commented out.

   Even though these commands are sometimes useful, they are no
substitute for the powerful _tag table_ facility of Emacs.  Viper's
`:tag' command in a primitive interface to Emacs tags.  *Note Tags:
(emacs)Tags, for more information on tags.

   The following two commands are normally bound to a mouse click and
are part of Viper.  They work only if Emacs runs as an application
under X Windows (or under some other window system for which a port of
GNU Emacs 20 is available).  Clicking the mouse when Emacs is invoked
in an Xterm window (using `emacs -nw') will do no good.

`viper-mouse-search-key  (meta shift 1)'
     This variable controls the _mouse-search_ feature of Viper.  The
     default value states that holding Meta and Shift keys while
     clicking mouse button 1 should initiate search for a region under
     the mouse pointer (defined below).  This command can take a prefix
     argument, which indicates the occurrence of the pattern to search
     for.

     Note: while loading initially, Viper binds this mouse action only
     if it is not already bound to something else.  If you want to use
     the mouse-search feature, and the `Meta-Shift-Mouse-1' mouse
     action is already bound to something else, you can rebind the
     mouse-search feature by setting `viper-mouse-search-key' to
     something else in your `~/.viper' file:
          (setq viper-mouse-search-key '(meta 1))
     This would bind mouse search to the action invoked by pressing the
     Meta key and clicking mouse button 1.  The allowed values of
     `viper-mouse-search-key' are lists that contain a mouse-button
     number (1,2, or 3) and any combination of the words `control',
     `meta', and `shift'.

     If the requested mouse action (e.g., (meta 1)) is already taken
     for other purposes then you have to confirm your intention by
     placing the following command in `~/.viper' after setting
     `viper-mouse-search-key':
          (viper-bind-mouse-search-key 'force)

     You can also change this setting interactively, through the
     customization widget of Emacs (choose option "Customize.Customize
     Group" from the menubar).

     The region that is chosen as a pattern to search for is determined
     as follows.  If search is invoked via a single click, Viper
     chooses the region that lies between the beginning of the "word"
     under the pointer ("word" is understood in Vi sense) and the end
     of that word.  The only difference with Vi's words is that in Lisp
     major modes `-' is considered an alphanumeric symbol.  This is
     done for the convenience of working with Lisp symbols, which often
     have an `-' in them.  Also, if you click on a non-alphanumeric
     character that is not a word separator (in Vi sense) then this
     character will also be considered alphanumeric, provided that it is
     adjacent (from either side) to an alphanumeric character.  This
     useful feature gives added control over the patterns selected by
     the mouse click.

     On a double-click, the region is determined by the beginning of
     the current Vi's "Word" (i.e., the largest non-separator chunk of
     text) and the End of that "Word" (as determined by the `E'
     command).

     On a triple-click, the region consists of the entire line where
     the click occurred with all leading and trailing spaces and tabs
     removed.

`viper-mouse-insert-key (meta shift 2)'
     This variable controls the _mouse-insert_ feature of Viper.  The
     above default value states that holding Meta and Shift keys while
     clicking mouse button 2 should insert the region surrounding the
     mouse pointer.  The rules defining this region are the same as for
     mouse-search.  This command takes an optional prefix argument,
     which indicates how many such regions to snarf from the buffer and
     insert.  (In case of a triple-click, the prefix argument is
     ignored.)

     Note: while loading initially, Viper binds this mouse action only
     if it not already bound to something else.  If you want to use
     this feature and the default mouse action is already bound, you
     can rebind mouse-insert by placing this command in `~/.viper':
          (setq viper-mouse-insert-key '(meta 2))
     If you want to bind mouse-insert to an action even if this action
     is already taked for other purposes in Emacs, then you should add
     this command to `~/.viper', after setting `viper-mouse-insert-key':
          (viper-bind-mouse-insert-key 'force)

     This value can also be changed via the Emacs customization widget
     at the menubar.

`viper-multiclick-timeout'
     This variable controls the rate at which double-clicking must
     occur for the purpose of mouse search and mouse insert.  By
     default, this is set to `double-click-time' in Emacs and to
     `mouse-track-multi-click-time' milliseconds in XEmacs.

   Note: The above functions search and insert in the selected window of
the latest active frame.  This means that you can click in another
window or another frame and have search or insertion done in the frame
and window you just left.  This lets one use these functions in a
multi-frame configuration.  However, this may require some getting used
to.  For instance, if you are typing in a frame, A, and then move the
mouse to frame B and click to invoke mouse search, search (or
insertion) will be performed in frame A.  To perform search/insertion
in frame B, you will first have to shift focus there, which doesn't
happen until you type a character or perform some other action in frame
B--mouse search doesn't shift focus.

   If you decide that you don't like the above feature and always want
search/insertion be performed in the frame where the click occurs, don't
bind (and unbind, if necessary) `viper-mouse-catch-frame-switch' from
the mouse event it is bound to.

   Mouse search is integrated with Vi-style search, so you can repeat
it with `n' and `N'.  It should be also noted that, while
case-sensitivity of search in Viper is controlled by the variable
`viper-case-fold-search', the case of mouse search is controlled by the
Emacs variable `case-fold-search', which may be set differently from
`viper-case-fold-search'.  Therefore, case-sensitivity of mouse search
may be different from that of the usual Vi-style search.

   Finally, if the way Viper determines the word to be searched for or
to be inserted is not what you want, there is a variable,
`viper-surrounding-word-function', which can be changed to indicate
another function for snarfing words out of the buffer.  The catch is
that you will then have to write such a function and make it known to
your Emacs.  The function `viper-surrounding-word' in `viper.el' can be
used as a guiding example.

Vi Macros
=========

   Viper supports much enhanced Vi-style macros and also facilitates
the use of Emacs-style macros.  To define a temporary macro, it is
generally more convenient to use Emacs keyboard macro facility.  Emacs
keyboard macros are usually defined anonymously, and the latest macro
can be executed by typing `C-x e' (or `*', if Viper is in Vi state).
If you need to use several temporary macros, Viper lets you save them
to a register (a lowercase letter); such macros can then be executed by
typing `@a' in Vi state (if a macro was previously saved in register
`a').  *Note Macros and Registers::, for details.

   If, however, you need to use a macro regularly, it must be given a
permanent name and saved.  Emacs manual explains how to do this, but
invocation of named Emacs macros is quite different from Vi's.  First,
invocation of permanent Emacs macros takes time because of the extra
keys.  Second, binding such macros to function keys, for fast access,
hogs valuable real estate on the keyboard.

   Vi-style macros are better in that respect, since Vi lets the user
overload the meaning of key sequences: keys typed in fast succession
are treated specially, if this key sequence is bound to a macro.

   Viper provides keyboard macros through the usual Ex commands, `:map'
and `:map!'.  Vi-style macros are much more powerful in Viper than they
are in the original Vi and in other emulators.  This is because Viper
implements an enhanced vi-style interface to the powerful Emacs
keyboard macro facility.

   First, any Emacs command can be executed while defining a macro, not
just the Vi commands.  In particular, the user can invoke Emacs
commands via `M-x command-name' or by pressing various function keys on
the keyboard.  One can even use the mouse, although this is usually not
useful and is not recommended (and macros defined with the use of the
mouse cannot be saved in command history and in the startup file, for
future use).

   Macros defined by mixing Vi and Emacs commands are represented as
vectors.  So, don't be confused when you see one (usually through the
history of Ex commands).  For instance, if `gg' is defined by typing
`l', the up-arrow key and `M-x next-line', its definition will look as
follows in Emacs:

     [l up (meta x) n e x t - l i n e return]

   Second, Viper macros are defined in a WYSIWYG style.  This means that
commands are executed as you type them, so you can see precisely what is
being defined.  Third, macros can be bound to arbitrary sequences of
keys, not just to printable keys.  For instance, one can define a macro
that will be invoked by hitting `f3' then `f2' function keys.  (The keys
`delete' and `backspace' are excluded; also, a macro invocation
sequence can't start with <ESC>.  Some other keys, such as `f1' and
`help', can't be bound to macros under Emacs, since they are bound in
`key-translation-map', which overrides any other binding the user gives
to keys.  In general, keys that have a binding in `key-translation-map'
can't be bound to a macro.)

   Fourth, in Viper, one can define macros that are specific to a given
buffer, a given major mode, or macros that are defined for all buffers.
In fact, the same macro name can have several different definitions:
one global, several definitions for various major modes, and
definitions for various specific buffers.  Buffer-specific definitions
override mode-specific definitions, which, in turn, override global
definitions.

   As if all that is not enough, Viper (through its interface to Emacs
macros) lets the user define keyboard macros that ask for confirmation
or even prompt the user for input and then continue.  To do this, one
should type `C-x q' (for confirmation) or `C-u C-x q' (for prompt).
For details, *note Customization: (emacs)Kbd Macro Query.

   When the user finishes defining a macro (which is done by typing
`C-x)' -- a departure from Vi), you will be asked whether you want this
macro to be global, mode-specific, or buffer-specific.  You will also be
given a chance to save the macro in your `~/.viper' file.  This is the
easiest way to save a macro and make it permanently available.  If you
work your startup files with bare hands, here is how Viper saves the
above macro so that it will be available in Viper's Insert state (and
Replace state) in buffer `my-buf' only:

     (viper-record-kbd-macro "gg" 'insert-state
            [l up (meta x) n e x t - l i n e return]
            "my-buf")

To do the same for Vi state and all buffers with the major mode
`cc-mode', use:

     (viper-record-kbd-macro "gg" 'vi-state
            [l up (meta x) n e x t - l i n e return]
            'cc-mode)

Both macro names and macro definitions are vectors of symbols that
denote keys on the keyboard.  Some keys, like `\', ` ', or digit-keys
must be escaped with a backslash.  Modified keys are represented as
lists.  For instance, holding Meta and Control and pressing `f4' is
represented as `(control meta f4)'.  If all members of a vectors are
printable characters (or sequences, such as `\e', `\t', for <ESC> and
<TAB>), then they can also be represented as strings:

     (viper-record-kbd-macro "aa" 'vi-state  "aaa\e"  "my-buffer")

Thus, typing `aa' fast in Vi state will switch Viper to Insert state
(due to the first `a'), insert `aa', and then it will switch back to Vi
state.  All this will take effect only in the buffer named `my-buffer'.

   Note that the last argument to `viper-record-kbd-macro' must be
either a string (a buffer name), a symbol representing a major mode, or
`t'; the latter says that the macro is to be defined for all buffers
(which is how macros are defined in original Vi).

   For convenience, Viper also lets you define Vi-style macros in its
Emacs state.  There is no Ex command, like `:map' and `:map!' for doing
this, but the user can include such a macro in the `~/.viper' file.  The
only thing is that the `viper-record-kbd-macro' command should specify
`emacs-state' instead of `vi-state' or `insert-state'.

   The user can get rid of a macro either by using the Ex commands
`:unmap' and `:unmap!' or by issuing a call to
`viper-unrecord-kbd-macro'.  The latter is more powerful, since it can
delete macros even in `emacs-state'.  However,
`viper-unrecord-kbd-macro' is usually needed only when the user needs
to get rid of the macros that are already predefined in Viper.  The
syntax is:
     (viper-unrecord-kbd-macro macro state)

The second argument must be `vi-state', `insert-state', or
`emacs-state'.  The first argument is a name of a macro.  To avoid
mistakes in specifying names of existing macros, type `M-x
viper-describe-kbd-macros' and use a name from the list displayed by
this command.

   If an error occurs during macro definition, Emacs aborts the
process, and it must be repeated.  This is analogous to Vi, except that
in Vi the user doesn't know there is an error until the macro is
actually run.  All that means that in order for a definition to be
successful, the user must do some simple planning of the process in
advance, to avoid errors.  For instance, if you want to map `gg' to
`llll' in Vi state, you must make sure that there is enough room on the
current line.  Since `l' moves the cursor forward, it may signal an
error on reaching the end of line, which will abort the definition.

   These precautions are necessary only when defining macros; they will
help avoid the need to redo the job.  When macros are actually run, an
error during the execution will simply terminate the current execution
(but the macro will remain mapped).

   A macro name can be a string of characters or a vector of keys.  The
latter makes it possible to define macros bound to, say, double-hits on
a function key, such as `up' or `f13'.  This is very useful if you run
out of function keys on your keyboard; it makes Viper macro facility a
_keyboard doubler_, so to speak.

   Elsewhere (*Note Key Bindings::, for details), we review the
standard Emacs mechanism for binding function keys to commands.  For
instance,

     (global-set-key [f13] 'repeat-complex-command)

binds the key f13 to the Emacs function that repeats the last minibuffer
command.  Under Viper, however, you may still use this key for
additional purposes, if you bind, say, a double-hitting action for that
key to some other function.  Emacs doesn't allow the user to do that,
but Viper does this through its keyboard macro facility.  To do this,
type `:map ' first.  When you are asked to enter a macro name, hit f13
twice, followed by <RET> or <SPC>.

   Emacs will now start the mapping process by actually executing Vi
and Emacs commands, so that you could see what will happen each time the
macro is executed.  Suppose now we wanted to bind the key sequence `f13
f13' to the command `eval-last-sexp'.  To accomplish this, we can type
`M-x eval-last-sexp' followed by `C-x )'.  If you answer positively to
Viper's offer to save this macro in `~/.viper' for future uses, the
following will be inserted in that file:

     (viper-record-kbd-macro [f16 f16] 'vi-state
              [(meta x) e v a l - l a s t - s e x p]
              'lisp-interaction-mode)

   To illustrate the above point, Viper provides two canned macros,
which, by default, are bound to `[f12 \1]' and `[f12 \2]' (invoked by
typing `f12' then `1' and `2', respectively).  These macros are useful
shortcuts to Viper's command ring history.  The first macro will
execute the second-last destructive command (the last one is executed
by `.', as usual).  The second macro executes the third-last command.

   If you need to go deeper into the command history, you will have to
use other commands, as described earlier in this section; or you can
bind, say, `f12 \3' like this:

     (viper-record-kbd-macro [f12 \3] 'vi-state
                           [(meta x) r e p e a t - f r o m - h i s t o r y]
                           t)

   Note that even though the macro uses the function key `f12', the key
is actually free and can still be bound to some Emacs function via
`define-key' or `global-set-key'.

   Viper allows the user to define macro names that are prefixes of
other macros.  For instance, one can define `[[' and `[[[[' to be
macros.  If you type the exact sequence of such keys and then pause,
Viper will execute the right macro.  However, if you don't pause and,
say, type `[[[[text' then the conflict is resolved as follows.  If only
one of the key sequences, `[[' or `[[[[' has a definition applicable to
the current buffer, then, in fact, there is no conflict and the right
macro will be chosen.  If both have applicable definitions, then the
first one found will be executed.  Usually this is the macro with a
shorter name.  So, in our case, `[[[[text' will cause the macro `[[' to
be executed twice and then the remaining keys, `t e x t', will be
processed.

   When defining macros using `:map' or `:map!', the user enters the
actually keys to be used to invoke the macro.  For instance, you should
hit the actual key `f6' if it is to be part of a macro name; you do
_not_ write `f 6'.  When entering keys, Viper displays them as strings
or vectors (e.g., `"abc"' or `[f6 f7 a]').  The same holds for
unmapping.  Hitting <TAB> while typing a macro name in the `:unmap' or
`:unmap!' command will cause name completion.  Completions are
displayed as strings or vectors.  However, as before, you don't
actually type `"', `[', or `]' that appear in the completions.  These
are meta-symbols that indicate whether the corresponding macro name is a
vector or a string.

   One last difference from Vi: Vi-style keyboard macros cannot be
defined in terms of other Vi-style keyboard macros (but named Emacs
macros are OK).  More precisely, while defining or executing a macro,
the special meaning of key sequences (as Vi macros) is ignored.  This
is because it is all too easy to create an infinite loop in this way.
Since Viper macros are much more powerful than Vi's it is impossible to
detect such loops.  In practice, this is not really a limitation but,
rather, a feature.

   We should also note that Vi macros are disabled in the Minibuffer,
which helps keep some potential troubles away.

   The rate at which the user must type keys in order for them to be
recognized as a timeout macro is controlled by the variable
`viper-fast-keyseq-timeout', which defaults to 200 milliseconds.

   For the most part, Viper macros defined in `~/.viper' can be shared
between X and TTY modes.  The problem with TTY may be that the function
keys there generate sequences of events instead of a single event (as
under a window system).  Emacs maps some of these sequences back to the
logical keys (e.g., the sequences generated by the arrow keys are
mapped to `up', `left', etc.).  However, not all function keys are
mapped in this way.  Macros that are bound to key sequences that
contain such unmapped function keys have to be redefined for TTY's (and
possibly for every type of TTY you may be using).  To do this, start
Emacs on an appropriate TTY device and define the macro using `:map',
as usual.

   Finally, Viper provides a function that conveniently displays all
macros currently defined.  To see all macros along with their
definitions, type `M-x viper-describe-kbd-macros'.

Groundwork
==========

   The VI command set is based on the idea of combining motion commands
with other commands.  The motion command is used as a text region
specifier for other commands.  We classify motion commands into "point
commands" and "line commands".

   The point commands are:

     `h', `l', `0',  `$', `w', `W', `b', `B', `e', `E', `(', `)', `/',
     `?', ``', `f', `F', `t', `T', `%', `;', `,', `^'

   The line commands are:

     `j', `k', `+', `-', `H', `M', `L', `{', `}', `G', `'',  `[[',
     `]]', `[]'

Text Deletion Commands (*note Deleting Text::), Change commands (*note
Changing Text::), even Shell Commands (*note Shell Commands::) use
these commands to describe a region of text to operate on.

   Viper adds two region descriptors, `r' and `R'.  These describe the
Emacs regions (*note Basics::), but they are not movement commands.

   The command description uses angle brackets `<>' to indicate
metasyntactic variables, since the normal conventions of using simple
text can be confusing with Viper where the commands themselves are
characters.  Watch out where `<' shift commands and `<count>' are
mentioned together!!!

   `<move>' refers to the above movement commands, and `<a-z>' refers
to registers or textmarkers from `a' to `z'.  Note that the `<move>'
is described by full move commands, that is to say they will take
counts, and otherwise behave like normal move commands.  `<address>'
refers to Ex line addresses, which include

`. <No address>'
     Current line

`.+n .-n'
     Add or subtract for current line

`number'
     Actual line number, use `.=' to get the line number

`'<a-z>'
     Textmarker

`$'
     Last line

`x,y'
     Where x and y are one of the above

`%'
     For the whole file, same as (1,$).

`/<pat>/'
`?<pat>?'
     Next or previous line with pattern <pat>.

     Note that the pattern is allowed to contain newline character
     (inserted as `C-qC-j').  Therefore, one can search for patterns
     that span several lines.

   Note that `%' is used in Ex commands `:e' and `:r <shell-cmd>' to
mean current file.  If you want a `%' in your command, it must be
escaped as `\%'. Note that `:w' and the regular `:r <file>' command
doesn't support the meta symbols `%' and `#', because file history is a
better mechanism.  Similarly, `#' expands to the previous file.  The
previous file is the first file in `:args' listing.  This defaults to
previous window in the VI sense if you have one window only.

Others like `<args> -- arguments', `<cmd> -- command' etc.  should be
fairly obvious.

Common characters referred to include:

`<sp>'
     Space

`<ht>'
     Tab

`<lf>'
     Linefeed

`<esc>'
     Escape

`<cr>'
     Return, Enter

   We also use `word' for alphanumeric/non-alphanumeric words, and
`WORD' for whitespace delimited words.  `char' refers to any ASCII
character, `CHAR' to non-whitespace character.  Brackets `[]' indicate
optional parameters; `<count>' also optional, usually defaulting to 1.
Brackets are elided for `<count>' to eschew obfuscation.

   Viper's idea of Vi's words is slightly different from Vi.  First,
Viper words understand Emacs symbol tables.  Therefore, all symbols
declared to be alphanumeric in a symbol table can automatically be made
part of the Viper word.  This is useful when, for instance, editing
text containing European, Cyrillic, Japanese, etc., texts.

   Second, Viper lets you depart from Vi's idea of a word by changing
the a syntax preference via the customization widget (the variable
`viper-syntax-preference') or by executing
`viper-set-syntax-preference' interactively.

   By default, Viper syntax preference is `reformed-vi', which means
that Viper considers only those symbols to be part of a word that are
specified as word-symbols by the current Emacs syntax table (which may
be different for different major modes) plus the underscore symbol `_',
minus the symbols that are not considered words in Vi (e.g., `,',;,
etc.), but may be considered as word-symbols by various Emacs major
modes.  Reformed-Vi works very close to Vi, and it also recognizes
words in other alphabets.  Therefore, this is the most appropriate mode
for editing text and is likely to fit all your needs.

   You can also set Viper syntax preference to `strict-vi', which would
cause Viper to view all non-English letters as non-word-symbols.

   You can also specify `emacs' as your preference, which would make
Viper use exactly the same notion of a word as Emacs does.  In
particular, the underscore may not be part of a word in some major
modes.

   Finally, if `viper-syntax-preference' is set to `extended', Viper
words would consist of characters that are classified as alphanumeric
_or_ as parts of symbols.  This is convenient for editing programs.

   `viper-syntax-preference' is a local variable, so it can have
different values for different major modes.  For instance, in
programming modes it can have the value `extended'.  In text modes
where words contain special characters, such as European (non-English)
letters, Cyrillic letters, etc., the value can be `reformed-vi' or
`emacs'.  If you consider using different syntactic preferences for
different major modes, you should execute, for example,

     (viper-set-syntax-preference nil "extended")

   in the appropriate major mode hooks.

   The above discussion concerns only the movement commands.  In regular
expressions, words remain the same as in Emacs.  That is, the
expressions `\w', `\>', `\<', etc., use Emacs' idea of what is a word,
and they don't look into the value of variable
`viper-syntax-preference'.  This is because Viper avoids changing
syntax tables in order to not thwart the various major modes that set
these tables.

   The usual Emacs convention is used to indicate Control Characters,
i.e C-h for Control-h.  _Do not confuse this to mean the separate
characters C - h!!!_ The `^' is itself, never used to indicate a
Control character.

   Finally, we note that Viper's Ex-style commands can be made to work
on the current Emacs region.  This is done by typing a digit argument
before `:'.  For instance, typing `1:' will propmt you with something
like _:123,135_, assuming that the current region starts at line 123 and
ends at line 135.  There is no need to type the line numbers, since
Viper inserts them automatically in front of the Ex command.

-------

   Emacs mark is referred to in the region specifiers `r' and `R'.
*Note Emacs Preliminaries::, and *Note Basics::, for explanation.  Also
see *Note Mark: (emacs)Mark, for an explanation of the Emacs mark ring.

`m<a-z>'
     Mark the current file and position with the specified letter.

`m .'
     Set the Emacs mark (*note Emacs Preliminaries::) at point.

`m ^'
     Set the Emacs mark (*note Emacs Preliminaries::) back to where it
     was last set with the `m.' command. This is useful when you set
     the mark with `m.', but then some other command (such as `L' or
     `G') changes it in a way that you didn't like.

`m <'
     Set the Emacs mark at beginning of buffer.

`m >'
     Set the Emacs mark at end of buffer.

`m ,'
     Jump to the Emacs mark.

`:mark <char>'
     Mark position with text marker named <char>.  This is an Ex
     command.

`:k <char>'
     Same as `:mark'.

```'
     Exchange point and mark.

`'''
     Exchange point and mark and go to the first CHAR on line.

     Show contents of textmarker.

`]<a-z>'
     Show contents of register.

`<count>  .'
     Repeat previous command <count> times.  For destructive commands
     as well as undo.

`f1 1 and f1 2'
     While `.' repeats the last destructive command, these two macros
     repeat the second-last and the third-last destructive commands.
     *Note Vi Macros::, for more information on Vi macros.

`C-c M-p and C-c M-n'
     In Vi state, these commands help peruse the history of Vi's
     destructive commands.  Successive typing of `C-c M-p' causes Viper
     to search the history in the direction of older commands, while
     hitting `C-c M-n' does so in reverse order.  Each command in the
     history is displayed in the Minibuffer.  The displayed command can
     then be executed by typing ``.''.

     Since typing the above sequences of keys may be tedious, the
     functions doing the perusing can be bound to unused keyboard keys
     in the `~/.viper' file.  *Note Viper Specials::, for details.

Deleting Text
-------------

   There is one difference in text deletion that you should be aware
of.  This difference comes from Emacs and was adopted in Viper because
we find it very useful.  In Vi, if you delete a line, say, and then
another line, these two deletions are separated and are put back
separately if you use the `p' command.  In Emacs (and Viper), successive
series of deletions that are _not interrupted_ by other commands are
lumped together, so the deleted text gets accumulated and can be put
back as one chunk.  If you want to break a sequence of deletions so
that the newly deleted text could be put back separately from the
previously deleted text, you should perform a non-deleting action,
e.g., move the cursor one character in any direction.

`<count>  x'
     Delete <count> chars under and after the cursor.

`<count>  X'
     Delete <count> chars before the cursor.

`<count>  d<move>'
     Delete from point to endpoint of <count><move>.

`<count>  dd'
     Delete <count> lines.

`D'
     The rest of the line.

`<count>  <<move>'
     Shift the lines described by <count><move> one shiftwidth to the
     left (layout!).

`<count>  <<'
     Shift <count> lines one shiftwidth to the left.
