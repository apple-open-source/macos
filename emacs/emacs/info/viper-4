Changing Text
-------------

`<count>  r<char>'
     Replace <count> chars by <char> - no <esc>.

`<count>  R'
     Overwrite the rest of the line, appending change COUNT - 1 times.

`<count>  s'
     Substitute <count> chars.

`<count>  S'
     Change <count> lines.

`<count>  c<move>'
     Change from begin to endpoint of <count><move>.

`<count>  cc'
     Change <count> lines.

`<count>  C'
     The rest of the line and <count> - 1 next lines.

`<count>  =<move>'
     Reindent the region described by move.

`<count>  ~'
     Switch lower and upper cases.

`<count>  J'
     Join <count> lines (default 2).

`:[x,y]s/<pat>/<repl>/<f>'
     Substitute (on lines x through y) the pattern <pat> (default the
     last pattern) with <repl>.  Useful flags <f> are `g' for `global'
     (i.e. change every non-overlapping occurrence of <pat>) and `c' for
     `confirm' (type `y' to confirm a particular substitution, else `n'
     ).  Instead of `/' any punctuation CHAR unequal to <space> <tab>
     and <lf> can be used as delimiter.

     In Emacs, `\&' stands for the last matched expression, so
     `s/[ab]+/\&\&/' will double the string matched by `[ab]'.  Viper
     doesn't treat `&' specially, unlike Vi: use `\&' instead.

     Note: _The newline character (inserted as `C-qC-j') can be used in
     <repl>_.

`:[x,y]copy [z]'
     Copy text between `x' and `y' to the position after `z'.

`:[x,y]t [z]'
     Same as `:copy'.

`:[x,y]move [z]'
     Move text between `x' and `y' to the position after `z'.

`&'
     Repeat latest Ex substitute command, e.g.  `:s/wrong/right'.

`C-c /'
     Toggle case-sensitive search.  With prefix argument, toggle
     vanilla/regular expression search.

`#c<move>'
     Change upper-case characters in the region to lower-case.

`#C<move>'
     Change lower-case characters in the region to upper-case.

`#q<move>'
     Insert specified string at the beginning of each line in the region

`C-c M-p and C-c M-n'
     In Insert and Replace states, these keys are bound to commands
     that peruse the history of the text previously inserted in other
     insert or replace commands.  By repeatedly typing `C-c M-p' or
     `C-c M-n', you will cause Viper to insert these previously used
     strings one by one.  When a new string is inserted, the previous
     one is deleted.

     In Vi state, these keys are bound to functions that peruse the
     history of destructive Vi commands.  *Note Viper Specials::, for
     details.

File and Buffer Handling
========================

   In all file handling commands, space should be typed before entering
the file name.  If you need to type a modifier, such as `>>' or `!',
don't put any space between the command and the modifier.

   Note that many Ex commands, e.g., `:w', accept command arguments. The
effect is that the command would start acting on the current region. For
instance, if the current region spans the lines 11 through 22, then if
you type `1:w' you would see `:11,22w' in the minibuffer.

`:q'
     Quit buffer except if modified.

`:q!'
     Quit buffer without checking.  In Viper, these two commands are
     identical.  Confirmation is required if exiting modified buffers
     that visit files.

`:suspend'

`:stop'
     Suspend Viper

`:[x,y] w'
     Write the file.  Viper makes sure that a final newline is always
     added to any file where this newline is missing.  This is done by
     setting Emacs variable `require-final-newline' to `t'.  If you
     don't like this feature, use `setq-default' to set
     `require-final-newline' to `nil'.  This must be done in `.viper'
     file.

`:[x,y] w <name>'
     Write to the file <name>.

`:[x,y] w>> <name>'
     Append the buffer to the file <name>.  There should be no space
     between `w' and `>>'.  Type space after the `>>' and see what
     happens.

`:w! <name>'
     Overwrite the file <name>.  In Viper, `:w' and `:w!' are identical.
     Confirmation is required for writing to an existing file (if this
     is not the file the buffer is visiting) or to a read-only file.

`:x,y w <name>'
     Write lines x through y to the file <name>.

`:wq'
     Write the file and kill buffer.

`:r <file> [<file> ...]'
     Read file into a buffer, inserting its contents after the current
     line.

`:xit'
     Same as `:wq'.

`:Write'
`:W'
     Save all unsaved buffers, asking for confirmation.

`:WWrite'
`:WW'
     Like `W', but without asking for confirmation.

`ZZ'
     Save current buffer and kill it.  If user level is 1, then save
     all files and kill Emacs.  Killing Emacs is the wrong way to use
     it, so you should switch to higher user levels as soon as possible.

`:x [<file>]'
     Save and kill buffer.

`:x! [<file>]'
     `:w![<file>]' and `:q'.

`:pre'
     Preserve the file - autosave buffers.

`:rec'
     Recover file from autosave.

`:f'
     Print file name and lines.

`:cd [<dir>]'
     Set the working directory to <dir> (default home directory).

`:pwd'
     Print present working directory.

`:e [+<cmd>] <files>'
     Edit files.  If no filename is given, edit the file visited by the
     current buffer.  If buffer was modified or the file changed on
     disk, ask for confirmation.  Unlike Vi, Viper allows `:e' to take
     multiple arguments.  The first file is edited the same way as in
     Vi.  The rest are visited in the usual Emacs way.

`:e! [+<cmd>] <files>'
     Re-edit file.  If no filename, re-edit current file.  In Viper,
     unlike Vi, `e!' is identical to `:e'.  In both cases, the user is
     asked to confirm if there is a danger of discarding changes to a
     buffer.

`:q!'
     Quit Vi without writing.

`C-^'
     Edit the alternate (normally the previous) file.

`:rew'
     Obsolete

`:args'
     List files not shown anywhere with counts for next

`:n [count]  [+<cmd>] [<files>]'
     Edit <count> file, or edit files.  The count comes from `:args'.

`:N [count] [+<cmd>] [<files>]'
     Like `:n', but the meaning of the variable EX-CYCLE-OTHER-WINDOW
     is reversed.

`:b'
     Switch to another buffer.  If EX-CYCLE-OTHER-WINDOW is `t', switch
     in another window.  Buffer completion is supported.  The variable
     VIPER-READ-BUFFER-FUNCTION controls which function is actually
     used to read the buffer name. The default is `read-buffer', but
     better alternatives are also available in Emacs (e.g.,
     `iswitchb-read-buffer').

`:B'
     Like `:b', but the meaning of EX-CYCLE-OTHER-WINDOW is reversed.

`:<address>r <name>'
     Read the file <name> into the buffer after the line <address>.

`v, V, C-v'
     Edit a file in current or another window, or in another frame.
     File name is typed in Minibuffer.  File completion and history are
     supported.


File: viper,  Node: Mapping,  Next: Shell Commands,  Prev: File and Buffer Handling,  Up: Commands

Mapping
=======

`:map <string>'
     Start defining a Vi-style keyboard macro.  For instance, typing
     `:map www' followed by `:!wc %' and then typing `C-x )' will cause
     `www' to run wc on current file (Vi replaces `%' with the current
     file name).

`C-x )'
     Finish defining a keyboard macro.  In Viper, this command
     completes the process of defining all keyboard macros, whether
     they are Emacs-style or Vi-style.  This is a departure from Vi,
     needed to allow WYSIWYG mapping of keyboard macros and to permit
     the use of function keys and arbitrary Emacs functions in the
     macros.

`:unmap <string>'
     Deprive <string> of its mappings in Vi state.

`:map! <string>'
     Map a macro for Insert state.

`:unmap! <string>'
     Deprive <string> of its mapping in Insert state (see `:unmap').

`@<a-z>'
     In Vi state, execute the contents of register as a command.

`@@'
     In Vi state, repeat last register command.

`@#'
     In Vi state, begin keyboard macro.  End with @<a-z>.  This will
     put the macro in the proper register.  Register will be
     automatically down-cased.  *Note Macros and Registers::, for more
     info.

`@!<a-z>'
     In Vi state, yank anonymous macro to register

`*'
     In Vi state, execute anonymous macro (defined by C-x( and C-x )).

`C-x e'
     Like `*', but works in all Viper states.

`#g<move>'
     Execute the last keyboard macro for each line in the region.
     *Note Macros and Registers::, for more info.

`[<a-z>'
     Show contents of textmarker.

`]<a-z>'
     Show contents of register.


File: viper,  Node: Shell Commands,  Next: Options,  Prev: Mapping,  Up: Commands

Shell Commands
==============

   The symbol `%' is used in Ex shell commands to mean current file.  If
you want a `%' in your command, it must be escaped as `\%'.  However if
`%' is the first character, it stands as the address for the whole file.
Similarly, `#' expands to the previous file.  The previous file is the
first file in `:args' listing.  This defaults to the previous file in
the VI sense if you have one window.

   Symbols `%' and `#' are also used in the Ex commands `:e' and `:r
<shell-cmd>'.  The commands `:w' and the regular `:r <file>' command
don't support these meta symbols, because file history is a better
mechanism.

`:sh'
     Execute a subshell in another window

`:[x,y]!<cmd>'
     Execute a shell <cmd> [on lines x through y; % is replace by
     current file, \% is changed to %

`:[x,y]!! [<args>]'
     Repeat last shell command [and append <args>].

`:!<cmd>'
     Just execute command and display result in a buffer.

`:!! <args>'
     Repeat last shell command and append <args>

`<count> !<move><cmd>'
     The shell executes <cmd>, with standard input the lines described
     by <count><move>, next the standard output replaces those lines
     (think of `cb', `sort', `nroff', etc.).

`<count> !!<cmd>'
     Give <count> lines as standard input to the shell <cmd>, next let
     the standard output replace those lines.

`:[x,y] w !<cmd>'
     Let lines x to y be standard input for <cmd> (notice the <sp>
     between `w' and `!').

`:<address>r !<cmd>'
     Put the output of <cmd> after the line <address> (default current).

`:<address>r <name>'
     Read the file <name> into the buffer after the line <address>
     (default current).

`:make'
     Run the make command in the current directory.

File: viper,  Node: Emacs Related Commands,  Prev: Options,  Up: Commands

Emacs Related Commands
======================

`C-\'
     Begin Meta command in Vi or Insert states.  Most often used as C-\
     x (M-x).

     Note: Emacs binds `C-\' to a function that offers to change the
     keyboard input method in the multilingual environment.  Viper
     overrides this binding.  However, it is still possible to switch
     the input method by typing `\ C-\' in the Vi command state and
     `C-z \ C-\' in the Insert state.  Or you can use the MULE menu on
     the menubar.

`C-z'
     In Insert and Replace states, prepare Viper to accept the next
     command and execute it as if Viper was in Vi state.  Then return
     to Insert state.

     In Vi state, switch to Emacs state; in Emacs state, switch to Vi
     state.

`C-c \'
     Switches to Vi state for the duration of a single command.  Then
     goes back to the original Viper state.  Works from Vi, Insert,
     Replace, and Emacs states.

`C-x0'
     Close Window

`C-x1'
     Close Other Windows

`C-x2'
     Split Window

`C-xo'
     Move among windows

`C-xC-f'
     Emacs find-file, useful in Insert state

`C-y'
     Put back the last killed text.  Similar to Vi's `p', but also
     works in Insert and Replace state.  This command doesn't work in
     Vi command state, since this binding is taken for something else.

`M-y'
     Undoes the last `C-y' and puts another kill from the kill ring.
     Using this command, you can try may different kills until you find
     the one you need.

Mouse-bound Commands
====================

   The following two mouse actions are normally bound to special search
and insert commands in of Viper:

`S-Mouse-1'
     Holding Shift and clicking mouse button 1 will initiate search for
     a region under the mouse pointer.  This command can take a prefix
     argument.  Note: Viper sets this binding only if this mouse action
     is not already bound to something else.  *Note Viper Specials::,
     for more information.

`S-Mouse-2'
     Holding Shift and clicking button 2 of the mouse will insert a
     region surrounding the mouse pointer.  This command can also take
     a prefix argument.  Note: Viper sets this binding only if this
     mouse action is not already bound to something else.  *Note Viper
