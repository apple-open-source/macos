Creating Citations
==================

 - User Option: reftex-bibfile-ignore-regexps
     List of regular expressions to exclude files in
     `\\bibliography{..}'.  File names matched by any of these regexps
     will not be parsed.  Intended for files which contain only
     `@string' macro definitions and the like, which are ignored by
     RefTeX anyway.

 - User Option: reftex-default-bibliography
     List of BibTeX database files which should be used if none are
     specified.  When `reftex-citation' is called from a document with
     neither a `\bibliography{...}' statement nor a `thebibliography'
     environment, RefTeX will scan these files instead.  Intended for
     using `reftex-citation' in non-LaTeX files.  The files will be
     searched along the BIBINPUTS or TEXBIB path.

 - User Option: reftex-sort-bibtex-matches
     Sorting of the entries found in BibTeX databases by
     reftex-citation.  Possible values:
          nil          Do not sort entries.
          author       Sort entries by author name.
          year         Sort entries by increasing year.
          reverse-year Sort entries by decreasing year.

 - User Option: reftex-cite-format
     The format of citations to be inserted into the buffer.  It can be
     a string, an alist or a symbol.  In the simplest case this is just
     the string `\cite{%l}', which is also the default.  See the
     definition of `reftex-cite-format-builtin' for more complex
     examples.

     If `reftex-cite-format' is a string, it will be used as the format.
     In the format, the following percent escapes will be expanded.

    `%l'
          The BibTeX label of the citation.

    `%a'
          List of author names, see also `reftex-cite-punctuation'.

    `%2a'
          Like %a, but abbreviate more than 2 authors like Jones et al.

    `%A'
          First author name only.

    `%e'
          Works like `%a', but on list of editor names. (`%2e' and `%E'
          work a well).

     It is also possible to access all other BibTeX database fields:

          %b booktitle     %c chapter        %d edition    %h howpublished
          %i institution   %j journal        %k key        %m month
          %n number        %o organization   %p pages      %P first page
          %r address       %s school         %u publisher  %t title
          %v volume        %y year
          %B booktitle, abbreviated          %T title, abbreviated

     Usually, only `%l' is needed.  The other stuff is mainly for the
     echo area display, and for `(setq reftex-comment-citations t)'.

     `%<' as a special operator kills punctuation and space around it
     after the string has been formatted.

     Beware that all this only works with BibTeX database files.  When
     citations are made from the `\bibitems' in an explicit
     `thebibliography' environment, only `%l' is available.

     If `reftex-cite-format' is an alist of characters and strings, the
     user will be prompted for a character to select one of the possible
     format strings.

     In order to configure this variable, you can either set
     `reftex-cite-format' directly yourself or set it to the _symbol_
     of one of the predefined styles.  The predefined symbols are those
     which have an association in the constant
     `reftex-cite-format-builtin')  E.g.: `(setq reftex-cite-format
     'natbib)'.

 - Hook: reftex-format-cite-function
     If non-`nil', should be a function which produces the string to
     insert as a citation.  Note that the citation format can also be
     changed with the variable `reftex-cite-format'.  The function will
     be called with two arguments, the CITATION-KEY and the
     DEFAULT-FORMAT (taken from `reftex-cite-format').  It should
     return the string to insert into the buffer.

 - User Option: reftex-comment-citations
     Non-`nil' means add a comment for each citation describing the full
     entry.  The comment is formatted according to
     `reftex-cite-comment-format'.

 - User Option: reftex-cite-comment-format
     Citation format used for commented citations.  Must _not_ contain
     `%l'.  See the variable `reftex-cite-format' for possible percent
     escapes.

 - User Option: reftex-cite-punctuation
     Punctuation for formatting of name lists in citations.  This is a
     list of 3 strings.
       1. normal names separator, like `, ' in Jones, Brown and Miller

       2. final names separator, like ` and '  in Jones, Brown and
          Miller

       3. The `et al.' string, like ` {\it et al.}' in Jones {\it et
          al.}

 - Normal Hook: reftex-select-bib-mode-hook
     Normal hook which is run when a selection buffer enters
     `reftex-select-bib-mode'.

 - Keymap: reftex-select-bib-map
     The keymap which is active in the citation-key selection process
     (*note Creating Citations::).


File: reftex,  Node: Options (Index Support),  Next: Options (Viewing Cross-References),  Prev: Options (Creating Citations),  Up: Options

Index Support
=============

 - User Option: reftex-support-index
     Non-`nil' means, index entries are parsed as well.  Index support
     is resource intensive and the internal structure holding the parsed
     information can become quite big.  Therefore it can be turned off.
     When this is `nil' and you execute a command which requires index
     support, you will be asked for confirmation to turn it on and
     rescan the document.

 - User Option: reftex-index-special-chars
     List of special characters in index entries, given as strings.
     These correspond to the `MakeIndex' keywords `(LEVEL ENCAP ACTUAL
     QUOTE ESCAPE)'.

 - User Option: reftex-index-macros
     List of macros which define index entries.  The structure of each
     entry is
          (MACRO INDEX-TAG KEY PREFIX EXCLUDE REPEAT)

     MACRO is the macro.  Arguments should be denoted by empty braces,
     as for example in `\index[]{*}'.  Use square brackets to denote
     optional arguments.  The star marks where the index key is.

     INDEX-TAG is a short name of the index.  `idx' and `glo' are
     reserved for the default index and the glossary.  Other indices can
     be defined as well.  If this is an integer, the Nth argument of the
     macro holds the index tag.

     KEY is a character which is used to identify the macro for input
     with `reftex-index'.  `?i', `?I', and `?g' are reserved for
     default index and glossary.

     PREFIX can be a prefix which is added to the KEY part of the index
     entry.  If you have a macro
     `\newcommand{\molec}[1]{#1\index{Molecules!#1}', this prefix
     should be `Molecules!'.

     EXCLUDE can be a function.  If this function exists and returns a
     non-nil value, the index entry at point is ignored.  This was
     implemented to support the (deprecated) `^' and `_' shortcuts in
     the LaTeX2e `index' package.

     REPEAT, if non-`nil', means the index macro does not typeset the
     entry in the text, so that the text has to be repeated outside the
     index macro.  Needed for `reftex-index-selection-or-word' and for
     indexing from the phrase buffer.

     The final entry may also be a symbol.  It must have an association
     in the variable `reftex-index-macros-builtin' to specify the main
     indexing package you are using.  Legal values are currently
          default         The LaTeX default - unnecessary to specify this one
          multind         The multind.sty package
          index           The index.sty package
          index-shortcut  The index.sty packages with the ^ and _ shortcuts.
                          Should not be used - only for old documents
     Note that AUCTeX sets these things internally for RefTeX as well,
     so with a sufficiently new version of AUCTeX, you should not set
     the package here.

 - User Option: reftex-index-default-macro
     The default index macro for `reftex-index-selection-or-word'.
     This is a list with `(MACRO-KEY DEFAULT-TAG)'.

     MACRO-KEY is a character identifying an index macro - see
     `reftex-index-macros'.

     DEFAULT-TAG is the tag to be used if the macro requires a TAG
     argument.  When this is `nil' and a TAG is needed, RefTeX will ask
     for it.  When this is the empty string and the TAG argument of the
     index macro is optional, the TAG argument will be omitted.

 - User Option: reftex-index-default-tag
     Default index tag.  When working with multiple indexes, RefTeX
     queries for an index tag when creating index entries or displaying
     a specific index.  This variable controls the default offered for
     these queries.  The default can be selected with <RET> during
     selection or completion.  Legal values of this variable are:
          nil        Do not provide a default index
          "tag"      The default index tag given as a string, e.g. "idx"
          last       The last used index tag will be offered as default

 - User Option: reftex-index-math-format
     Format of index entries when copied from inside math mode.  When
     `reftex-index-selection-or-word' is executed inside TeX math mode,
     the index key copied from the buffer is processed with this format
     string through the `format' function.  This can be used to add the
     math delimiters (e.g. `$') to the string.  Requires the
     `texmathp.el' library which is part of AUCTeX.

 - User Option: reftex-index-phrase-file-extension
     File extension for the index phrase file.  This extension will be
     added to the base name of the master file.

 - User Option: reftex-index-phrases-logical-and-regexp
     Regexp matching the `and' operator for index arguments in phrases
     file.  When several index arguments in a phrase line are separated
     by this operator, each part will generate an index macro.  So each
     match of the search phrase will produce _several_ different index
     entries.  Make sure this does no match things which are not
     separators.  This logical `and' has higher priority than the
     logical `or' specified in `reftex-index-phrases-logical-or-regexp'.

 - User Option: reftex-index-phrases-logical-or-regexp
     Regexp matching the `or' operator for index arguments in phrases
     file.  When several index arguments in a phrase line are separated
     by this operator, the user will be asked to select one of them at
     each match of the search phrase.  The first index arg will be the
     default.  A number key `1'-`9' must be pressed to switch to
     another.  Make sure this does no match things which are not
     separators.  The logical `and' specified in
     `reftex-index-phrases-logical-or-regexp' has higher priority than
     this logical `or'.

 - User Option: reftex-index-phrases-search-whole-words
     Non-`nil' means phrases search will look for whole words, not
     subwords.  This works by requiring word boundaries at the
     beginning and end of the search string.  When the search phrase
     already has a non-word-char at one of these points, no word
     boundary is required there.

 - User Option: reftex-index-phrases-case-fold-search
     Non-`nil' means, searching for index phrases will ignore case.

 - User Option: reftex-index-phrases-skip-indexed-matches
     Non-`nil' means, skip matches which appear to be indexed already.
     When doing global indexing from the phrases buffer, searches for
     some phrases may match at places where that phrase was already
     indexed.  In particular when indexing an already processed
     document again, this will even be the norm.  When this variable is
     non-`nil', RefTeX checks if the match is an index macro argument,
     or if an index macro is directly before or after the phrase.  If
     that is the case, that match will be ignored.

 - User Option: reftex-index-phrases-wrap-long-lines
     Non-`nil' means, when indexing from the phrases buffer, wrap lines.
     Inserting indexing commands in a line makes the line longer - often
     so long that it does not fit onto the screen.  When this variable
     is non-`nil', newlines will be added as necessary before and/or
     after the indexing command to keep lines short.  However, the
     matched text phrase and its index command will always end up on a
     single line.

 - User Option: reftex-index-phrases-sort-prefers-entry
     Non-`nil' means when sorting phrase lines, the explicit index entry
     is used. Phrase lines in the phrases buffer contain a search
     phrase, and sorting is normally based on these.  Some phrase lines
     also have an explicit index argument specified.  When this
     variable is non-`nil', the index argument will be used for sorting.

 - User Option: reftex-index-phrases-sort-in-blocks
     Non-`nil' means, empty and comment lines separate phrase buffer
     into blocks.  Sorting will then preserve blocks, so that lines are
     re-arranged only within blocks.

 - User Option: reftex-index-phrases-map
     Keymap for the Index Phrases buffer.

 - User Option: reftex-index-phrases-mode-hook
     Normal hook which is run when a buffer is put into
     `reftex-index-phrases-mode'.

 - User Option: reftex-index-section-letters
     The letters which denote sections in the index.  Usually these are
     all capital letters.  Don't use any downcase letters.  Order is not
     significant, the index will be sorted by whatever the sort function
     thinks is correct.  In addition to these letters, RefTeX will
     create a group `!' which contains all entries sorted below the
     lowest specified letter.  In the `*Index*' buffer, pressing any of
     these capital letters or `!' will jump to that section.

 - User Option: reftex-index-include-context
     Non-`nil' means, display the index definition context in the
     `*Index*' buffer.  This flag may also be toggled from the
     `*Index*' buffer with the `c' key.

 - User Option: reftex-index-follow-mode
     Non-`nil' means, point in `*Index*' buffer will cause other window
     to follow.  The other window will show the corresponding part of
     the document.  This flag can be toggled from within the `*Index*'
     buffer with the `f' key.

 - Keymap: reftex-index-map
     The keymap which is active in the `*Index*' buffer (*note Index
     Support::).

Viewing Cross-References
========================

 - User Option: reftex-view-crossref-extra
     Macros which can be used for the display of cross references.
     This is used when `reftex-view-crossref' is called with point in an
     argument of a macro.  Note that crossref viewing for citations,
     references (both ways) and index entries is hard-coded.  This
     variable is only to configure additional structures for which
     crossreference viewing can be useful.  Each entry has the structure
          (MACRO-RE SEARCH-RE HIGHLIGHT).
     MACRO-RE is matched against the macro.  SEARCH-RE is the regexp
     used to search for cross references.  `%s' in this regexp is
     replaced with with the macro argument at point.  HIGHLIGHT is an
     integer indicating which subgroup of the match should be
     highlighted.

 - User Option: reftex-auto-view-crossref
     Non-`nil' means, initially turn automatic viewing of crossref info
     on.  Automatic viewing of crossref info normally uses the echo
     area.  Whenever point is on the argument of a `\ref' or `\cite'
     macro, and no other message is being displayed, the echo area will
     display information about that cross reference.  You can also set
     the variable to the symbol `window'.  In this case a small
     temporary window is used for the display.  This feature can be
     turned on and of from the menu (Ref->Options).

 - User Option: reftex-idle-time
     Time (secs) Emacs has to be idle before automatic crossref display
     is done.

 - User Option: reftex-cite-view-format
     Citation format used to display citation info in the message area.
     See the variable `reftex-cite-format' for possible percent
     escapes.

 - User Option: reftex-revisit-to-echo
     Non-`nil' means, automatic citation display will revisit files if
     necessary.  When nil, citation display in echo area will only be
     active for cached echo strings (see `reftex-cache-cite-echo'), or
     for BibTeX database files which are already visited by a live
     associated buffers.

 - User Option: reftex-cache-cite-echo
     Non-`nil' means, the information displayed in the echo area for
     cite macros (see variable `reftex-auto-view-crossref') is cached
     and saved along with the parsing information.  The cache survives
     document scans.  In order to clear it, use `M-x reftex-reset-mode'.

Finding Files
=============

 - User Option: reftex-texpath-environment-variables
     List of specifications how to retrieve the search path for TeX
     files.  Several entries are possible.
        - If an element is the name of an environment variable, its
          content is used.

        - If an element starts with an exclamation mark, it is used as
          a command to retrieve the path.  A typical command with the
          kpathsearch library would be `"!kpsewhich -show-path=.tex"'.

        - Otherwise the element itself is interpreted as a path.
     Multiple directories can be separated by the system dependent
     `path-separator'.  Directories ending in `//' or `!!' will be
     expanded recursively.  See also `reftex-use-external-file-finders'.

 - User Option: reftex-bibpath-environment-variables
     List of specifications how to retrieve the search path for BibTeX
     files.  Several entries are possible.
        - If an element is the name of an environment variable, its
          content is used.

        - If an element starts with an exclamation mark, it is used as
          a command to retrieve the path.  A typical command with the
          kpathsearch library would be `"!kpsewhich -show-path=.bib"'.

        - Otherwise the element itself is interpreted as a path.
     Multiple directories can be separated by the system dependent
     `path-separator'.  Directories ending in `//' or `!!' will be
     expanded recursively.  See also `reftex-use-external-file-finders'.

 - User Option: reftex-file-extensions
     Association list with file extensions for different file types.
     This is a list of items, each item is like: `(TYPE . (DEF-EXT
     OTHER-EXT ...))'
          TYPE:       File type like `"bib"' or `"tex"'.
          DEF-EXT:    The default extension for that file type, like `".tex"' or `".bib"'.
          OTHER-EXT:  Any number of other legal extensions for this file type.
     When a files is searched and it does not have any of the legal
     extensions, we try the default extension first, and then the naked
     file name.

 - User Option: reftex-search-unrecursed-path-first
     Non-`nil' means, search all specified directories before trying
     recursion.  Thus, in a path `.//:/tex/', search first `./', then
     `/tex/', and then all subdirectories of `./'.  If this option is
     `nil', the subdirectories of `./' are searched before `/tex/'.
     This is mainly for speed - most of the time the recursive path is
     for the system files and not for the user files.  Set this to
     `nil' if the default makes RefTeX finding files with equal names
     in wrong sequence.

 - User Option: reftex-use-external-file-finders
     Non-`nil' means, use external programs to find files.  Normally,
     RefTeX searches the paths given in the environment variables
     `TEXINPUTS' and `BIBINPUTS' to find TeX files and BibTeX database
     files.  With this option turned on, it calls an external program
     specified in the option `reftex-external-file-finders' instead.
     As a side effect, the variables
     `reftex-texpath-environment-variables' and
     `reftex-bibpath-environment-variables' will be ignored.

 - User Option: reftex-external-file-finders
     Association list with external programs to call for finding files.
     Each entry is a cons cell `(TYPE . PROGRAM)'.  TYPE is either
     `"tex"' or `"bib"'.  PROGRAM is a string containing the external
     program to use with any arguments.  `%f' will be replaced by the
     name of the file to be found.  Note that these commands will be
     executed directly, not via a shell.  Only relevant when
     `reftex-use-external-file-finders' is non-`nil'.

Optimizations
=============

 - User Option: reftex-keep-temporary-buffers
     Non-`nil' means, keep buffers created for parsing and lookup.
     RefTeX sometimes needs to visit files related to the current
     document.  We distinguish files visited for
    PARSING
          Parts of a multifile document loaded when (re)-parsing the
          document.

    LOOKUP
          BibTeX database files and TeX files loaded to find a
          reference, to display label context, etc.  The created
     buffers can be kept for later use, or be thrown away immediately
     after use, depending on the value of this variable:

    `nil'
          Throw away as much as possible.

    `t'
          Keep everything.

    `1'
          Throw away buffers created for parsing, but keep the ones
          created for lookup.

     If a buffer is to be kept, the file is visited normally (which is
     potentially slow but will happen only once). If a buffer is to be
     thrown away, the initialization of the buffer depends upon the
     variable `reftex-initialize-temporary-buffers'.

 - User Option: reftex-initialize-temporary-buffers
     Non-`nil' means do initializations even when visiting file
     temporarily.  When `nil', RefTeX may turn off find-file hooks and
     other stuff to briefly visit a file. When `t', the full default
     initializations are done (`find-file-hook' etc.).  Instead of `t'
     or `nil', this variable may also be a list of hook functions to do
     a minimal initialization.

 - User Option: reftex-no-include-regexps
     List of regular expressions to exclude certain input files from
     parsing.  If the name of a file included via `\include' or
     `\input' is matched by any of the regular expressions in this
     list, that file is not parsed by RefTeX.

 - User Option: reftex-enable-partial-scans
     Non-`nil' means, re-parse only 1 file when asked to re-parse.
     Re-parsing is normally requested with a `C-u' prefix to many RefTeX
     commands, or with the `r' key in menus.  When this option is `t'
     in a multifile document, we will only parse the current buffer, or
     the file associated with the label or section heading near point
     in a menu.  Requesting re-parsing of an entire multifile document
     then requires a `C-u C-u' prefix or the capital `R' key in menus.

 - User Option: reftex-save-parse-info
     Non-`nil' means, save information gathered with parsing in files.
     The file `MASTER.rel' in the same directory as `MASTER.tex' is
     used to save the information.  When this variable is `t',
        - accessing the parsing information for the first time in an
          editing session will read that file (if available) instead of
          parsing the document.

        - exiting Emacs or killing a buffer in reftex-mode will cause a
          new version of the file to be written.

 - User Option: reftex-parse-file-extension
     File extension for the file in which parser information is stored.
     This extension is added to the base name of the master file.

 - User Option: reftex-allow-automatic-rescan
     Non-`nil' means, RefTeX may rescan the document when this seems
     necessary.  Applies (currently) only in rare cases, when a new
     label cannot be placed with certainty into the internal label list.

 - User Option: reftex-use-multiple-selection-buffers
     Non-`nil' means use a separate selection buffer for each label
     type.  These buffers are kept from one selection to the next and
     need not to be created for each use - so the menu generally comes
     up faster.  The selection buffers will be erased (and therefore
     updated) automatically when new labels in its category are added.
     See the variable `reftex-auto-update-selection-buffers'.

 - User Option: reftex-auto-update-selection-buffers
     Non-`nil' means, selection buffers will be updated automatically.
     When a new label is defined with `reftex-label', all selection
     buffers associated with that label category are emptied, in order
     to force an update upon next use.  When `nil', the buffers are left
     alone and have to be updated by hand, with the `g' key from the
     label selection process.  The value of this variable will only
     have any effect when `reftex-use-multiple-selection-buffers' is
     non-`nil'.

Fontification
=============

 - User Option: reftex-use-fonts
     Non-`nil' means, use fonts in label menu and on-the-fly help.
     Font-lock must be loaded as well to actually get fontified
     display.  After changing this option, a rescan may be necessary to
     activate it.

 - User Option: reftex-refontify-context
     Non-`nil' means, re-fontify the context in the label menu with
     font-lock.  This slightly slows down the creation of the label
     menu.  It is only necessary when you definitely want the context
     fontified.

     This option may have 3 different values:
    `nil'
          Never refontify.

    `t'
          Always refontify.

    `1'
          Refontify when necessary, e.g. with old versions of the
          x-symbol package.  The option is ignored when
     `reftex-use-fonts' is `nil'.

 - User Option: reftex-highlight-selection
     Non-`nil' means, highlight selected text in selection and `*toc*'
     buffers.  Normally, the text near the cursor is the _selected_
     text, and it is highlighted.  This is the entry most keys in the
     selection and `*toc*' buffers act on.  However, if you mainly use
     the mouse to select an item, you may find it nice to have
     mouse-triggered highlighting _instead_ or _as well_. The variable
     may have one of these values:

          nil      No highlighting.
          cursor   Highlighting is cursor driven.
          mouse    Highlighting is mouse driven.
          both     Both cursor and mouse trigger highlighting.

     Changing this variable requires to rebuild the selection and *toc*
     buffers to become effective (keys `g' or `r').

 - User Option: reftex-cursor-selected-face
     Face name to highlight cursor selected item in toc and selection
     buffers.  See also the variable `reftex-highlight-selection'.

 - User Option: reftex-mouse-selected-face
     Face name to highlight mouse selected item in toc and selection
     buffers.  See also the variable `reftex-highlight-selection'.

 - User Option: reftex-file-boundary-face
     Face name for file boundaries in selection buffer.

 - User Option: reftex-label-face
     Face name for labels in selection buffer.

 - User Option: reftex-section-heading-face
     Face name for section headings in toc and selection buffers.

 - User Option: reftex-toc-header-face
     Face name for the header of a toc buffer.

 - User Option: reftex-bib-author-face
     Face name for author names in bib selection buffer.

 - User Option: reftex-bib-year-face
     Face name for year in bib selection buffer.

 - User Option: reftex-bib-title-face
     Face name for article title in bib selection buffer.

 - User Option: reftex-bib-extra-face
     Face name for bibliographic information in bib selection buffer.

 - User Option: reftex-select-mark-face
     Face name for marked entries in the selection buffers.

 - User Option: reftex-index-header-face
     Face name for the header of an index buffer.

 - User Option: reftex-index-section-face
     Face name for the start of a new letter section in the index.

 - User Option: reftex-index-tag-face
     Face name for index names (for multiple indices).

Miscellaneous
=============

 - User Option: reftex-extra-bindings
     Non-`nil' means, make additional key bindings on startup.  These
     extra bindings are located in the users `C-c letter' map.  *Note
     Key Bindings::.

 - User Option: reftex-plug-into-AUCTeX
     Plug-in flags for AUCTeX interface.  This variable is a list of 5
     boolean flags.  When a flag is non-`nil', RefTeX will

          - supply labels in new sections and environments  (flag 1)
          - supply arguments for macros like `\label'         (flag 2)
          - supply arguments for macros like `\ref'           (flag 3)
          - supply arguments for macros like `\cite'          (flag 4)
          - supply arguments for macros like `\index'         (flag 5)

     You may also set the variable itself to t or nil in order to turn
     all options on or off, respectively.
     Supplying labels in new sections and environments applies when
     creating sections with `C-c C-s' and environments with `C-c C-e'.
     Supplying macro arguments applies when you insert such a macro
     interactively with `C-c <RET>'.
     See the AUCTeX documentation for more information.

 - User Option: reftex-revisit-to-follow
     Non-`nil' means, follow-mode will revisit files if necessary.
     When nil, follow-mode will be suspended for stuff in unvisited
     files.

 - User Option: reftex-allow-detached-macro-args
     Non-`nil' means, allow arguments of macros to be detached by
     whitespace.  When this is `t', the `aaa' in `\bbb [xxx] {aaa}'
     will be considered an argument of `\bb'.  Note that this will be
     the case even if `\bb' is defined with zero or one argument.

Keymaps and Hooks
=================

   RefTeX has the usual general keymap and load- and mode-hook.

 - Keymap: reftex-mode-map
     The keymap for RefTeX mode.

 - Normal Hook: reftex-load-hook
     Normal hook which is being run when loading `reftex.el'.

 - Normal Hook: reftex-mode-hook
     Normal hook which is being run when turning on RefTeX mode.

   Furthermore, the 4 modes used for referencing labels, creating
citations, the table of contents buffer and the phrases buffer have
their own keymaps and mode hooks.  See the respective sections.  There
are many more hooks which are described in the relevant sections about
options for a specific part of RefTeX.

Changes
*******

   Here is a list of recent changes to RefTeX.

Version 4.00
   * RefTeX has been split into several smaller files which are
     autoloaded on demand.

   * Index support, along with many new options.

   * The selection of keys for `\ref' and `\cite' now allows to select
     multiple items by marking entries with the `m' key.

   * Fancyref support.
    Version 4.01
   * New command `reftex-index-globally' to index a word in many places
     in the document.  Also available from the index buffer with `&'.

   * The first item in a `reftex-label-alist' entry may now also be a
     parser function to do non-standard parsing.

   * `reftex-auto-view-crossref' no longer interferes with
     `pop-up-frames' (patch from Stefan Monnier).
 Version 4.02
   * macros ending in `refrange' are considered to contain references.

   * Index entries made with `reftex-index-selection-or-word' in TeX
     math mode automatically get enclosing `$' to preserve math mode.
     See new option `reftex-index-math-format'.  Requires AUCTeX.
 Version 4.04
   * New option `reftex-index-default-tag' implements a default for
     queries.
 Version 4.06
   * `reftex-section-levels' can contain a function to compute the level
     of a sectioning command.

   * Multiple `thebibliography' environments recognized.
 Version 4.09
   * New option `reftex-toc-max-level' to limit the depth of the toc.
     New key binding `t' in the `*toc*' buffer to change this setting.

   * RefTeX maintaines an `Index Phrases' file in which phrases can be
     collected.  When the document is ready, RefTeX can search all
     these phrases and assist indexing all matches.

   * The variables `reftex-index-macros' and
     `reftex-index-default-macro' have changed their syntax slightly.
     The REPEAT parameter has move from the latter to the former.  Also
     calls to `reftex-add-index-macros' from AUCTeX style files need to
     be adapted.

   * The variable `reftex-section-levels' no longer contains the
     default stuff which has been moved to a constant.

   * Environments like theorems can be placed into the TOC by putting
     entries for `"begin{theorem}"' in `reftex-setion-levels'.
 Version 4.10
   * Renamed `reftex-vcr.el' to `reftex-dcr.el' because of conflict
     with `reftex-vars.el' on DOS machines.

   * New options `reftex-parse-file-extension' and
     `reftex-index-phrase-file-extension'.
 Version 4.11
   * Fixed bug which would parse `\Section' just like `\section'.
