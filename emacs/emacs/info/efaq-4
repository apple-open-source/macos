File: efaq,  Node: Terminal setup code works after Emacs has begun,  Next: Using function keys under X,  Prev: Invalid prefix characters,  Up: Key bindings

Why doesn't this [terminal or window-system setup] code work in my `.emacs' file, but it works just fine after Emacs starts up?
===============================================================================================================================

   During startup, Emacs initializes itself according to a given
code/file order.  If some of the code executed in your `.emacs' file
needs to be postponed until the initial terminal or window-system setup
code has been executed but is not, then you will experience this
problem (this code/file execution order is not enforced after startup).

   To postpone the execution of Emacs Lisp code until after terminal or
window-system setup, treat the code as a "lambda list" and set the
value of either the `term-setup-hook' or `window-setup-hook' variable
to this lambda function.  For example,

     (add-hook 'term-setup-hook
               (lambda ()
                (when (string-match "\\`vt220" (or (getenv "TERM") ""))
                  ;; Make vt220's "Do" key behave like M-x:
                  (global-set-key [do] 'execute-extended-command))))

   For information on what Emacs does every time it is started, see the
`lisp/startup.el' file.


File: efaq,  Node: Using function keys under X,  Next: Working with function and arrow keys,  Prev: Terminal setup code works after Emacs has begun,  Up: Key bindings

How do I use function keys under X?
===================================

   With Emacs 19, functions keys under X are bound like any other key.
*Note Binding keys to commands::, for details.


File: efaq,  Node: Working with function and arrow keys,  Next: X key translations for Emacs,  Prev: Using function keys under X,  Up: Key bindings

How do I tell what characters or symbols my function or arrow keys emit?
========================================================================

   Type `C-h c' then the function or arrow keys.  The command will
return either a function key symbol or character sequence (see the
Emacs on-line documentation for an explanation).  This works for other
keys as well.


File: efaq,  Node: X key translations for Emacs,  Next: Handling C-s and C-q with flow control,  Prev: Working with function and arrow keys,  Up: Key bindings

How do I set the X key "translations" for Emacs?
================================================

   Emacs is not written using the Xt library by default, so there are no
"translations" to be set.  (We aren't sure how to set such translations
if you do build Emacs with Xt; please let us know if you've done this!)

   The only way to affect the behavior of keys within Emacs is through
`xmodmap' (outside Emacs) or `define-key' (inside Emacs).  The
`define-key' command should be used in conjunction with the
`function-key-map' map.  For instance,

     (define-key function-key-map [M-<TAB>] [?\M-\t])

defines the `M-<TAB>' key sequence.


File: efaq,  Node: Handling C-s and C-q with flow control,  Next: Binding C-s and C-q,  Prev: X key translations for Emacs,  Up: Key bindings

How do I handle `C-s' and `C-q' being used for flow control?
============================================================

   `C-s' and `C-q' are used in the XON/XOFF flow control protocol.
This messes things up when you're using Emacs over a serial line,
because Emacs binds these keys to commands by default.  Because Emacs
won't honor them as flow control characters, too many of these
characters are not passed on and overwhelm output buffers.  Sometimes,
intermediate software using XON/XOFF flow control will prevent Emacs
from ever seeing `C-s' and `C-q'.

   Possible solutions:

   * Disable the use of `C-s' and `C-q' for flow control.

     You need to determine the cause of the flow control.

        - your terminal

          Your terminal may use XON/XOFF flow control to have time to
          display all the characters it receives.  For example, VT
          series terminals do this.  It may be possible to turn this
          off from a setup menu.  For example, on a VT220 you may
          select "No XOFF" in the setup menu.  This is also true for
          some terminal emulation programs on PCs.

          When you turn off flow control at the terminal, you will also
          need to turn it off at the other end, which might be at the
          computer you are logged in to or at some terminal server in
          between.

          If you turn off flow control, characters may be lost; using a
          printer connected to the terminal may fail.  You may be able
          to get around this problem by modifying the `termcap' entry
          for your terminal to include extra NUL padding characters.

        - a modem

          If you are using a dialup connection, the modems may be using
          XON/XOFF flow control.  It's not clear how to get around this.

        - a router or terminal server

          Some network box between the terminal and your computer may
          be using XON/XOFF flow control.  It may be possible to make
          it use some other kind of flow control.  You will probably
          have to ask your local network experts for help with this.

        - `tty' and/or `pty' devices

          If your connection to Emacs goes through multiple `tty' and/or
          `pty' devices, they may be using XON/XOFF flow control even
          when it is not necessary.

          Eirik Fuller <eirik@theory.tn.cornell.edu> writes:

               Some versions of `rlogin' (and possibly `telnet') do not
               pass flow control characters to the remote system to
               which they connect.  On such systems, Emacs on the
               remote system cannot disable flow control on the local
               system.  Sometimes `rlogin -8' will avoid this problem.

               One way to cure this is to disable flow control on the
               local host (the one running `rlogin', not the one
               running `rlogind') using the `stty' command, before
               starting the `rlogin' process.  On many systems, `stty
               start u stop u' will do this.

               Some versions of `tcsh' will prevent even this from
               working.  One way around this is to start another shell
               before starting rlogin, and issue the `stty' command to
               disable flow control from that shell.

          Use `stty -ixon' instead of `stty start u stop u' on some
          systems.


   * Make Emacs speak the XON/XOFF flow control protocol.

     You can make Emacs treat `C-s' and `C-q' as flow control
     characters by evaluating the form

          (enable-flow-control)

     to unconditionally enable flow control or

          (enable-flow-control-on "vt100" "h19")

     (using your terminal names instead of `vt100' or `h19') to enable
     selectively.  These commands will automatically swap `C-s' and
     `C-q' to `C-\' and `C-^'.  Variables can be used to change the
     default swap keys (`flow-control-c-s-replacement' and
     `flow-control-c-q-replacement').

     If you are fixing this for yourself, simply put the form in your
     `.emacs' file.  If you are fixing this for your entire site, the
     best place to put it is in the `site-lisp/site-start.el' file.
     (Here `site-lisp' is actually a subdirectory of your Emacs
     installation directory, typically `/usr/local/share/emacs'.)
     Putting this form in `site-lisp/default.el' has the problem that
     if the user's `.emacs' file has an error, this will prevent
     `default.el' from being loaded and Emacs may be unusable for the
     user, even for correcting their `.emacs' file (unless they're
     smart enough to move it to another name).

     `enable-flow-control' can be invoked interactively as well: `M-x
     enable-flow-control <RET>'.


   For further discussion of this issue, read the file `etc/PROBLEMS'
(in the Emacs source directory when you unpack the Emacs distribution).


File: efaq,  Node: Binding C-s and C-q,  Next: Backspace invokes help,  Prev: Handling C-s and C-q with flow control,  Up: Key bindings

How do I bind `C-s' and `C-q' (or any key) if these keys are filtered out?
==========================================================================

   To bind `C-s' and `C-q', use either `enable-flow-control' or
`enable-flow-control-on'.  *Note Handling C-s and C-q with flow
control::, for usage and implementation details.

   To bind other keys, use `keyboard-translate'.  *Note Swapping
keys::, for usage details.  To do this for an entire site, you should
swap the keys in `site-lisp/site-start.el'.  *Note Handling C-s and C-q
with flow control::, for an explanation of why `site-lisp/default.el'
should not be used.

   * If you do this for an entire site, the users will be confused by
     the disparity between what the documentation says and how Emacs
     actually behaves.



File: efaq,  Node: Backspace invokes help,  Next: stty and Backspace key,  Prev: Binding C-s and C-q,  Up: Key bindings

Why does the <Backspace> key invoke help?
=========================================

   The <Backspace> key (on most keyboards) generates ASCII code 8.
`C-h' sends the same code.  In Emacs by default `C-h' invokes
help-command.  This is intended to be easy to remember since the first
letter of `help' is `h'.  The easiest solution to this problem is to
use `C-h' (and <Backspace>) for help and <DEL> (the <Delete> key) for
deleting the previous character.

   For many people this solution may be problematic:

   * They normally use <Backspace> outside of Emacs for deleting the
     previous character.  This can be solved by making <DEL> the command
     for deleting the previous character outside of Emacs.  On many Unix
     systems, this command will remap <DEL>:

          stty erase `^?'

   * The user may prefer the <Backspace> key for deleting the previous
     character because it is more conveniently located on their
     keyboard or because they don't even have a separate <Delete> key.
     In this case, the <Backspace> key should be made to behave like
     <Delete>.  There are several methods.

        - Some terminals (e.g., VT3## terminals) and terminal emulators
          (e.g., TeraTerm) allow the character generated by the
          <Backspace> key to be changed from a setup menu.

        - You may be able to get a keyboard that is completely
          programmable, or a terminal emulator that supports remapping
          of any key to any other key.

        - With Emacs 21.1 and later, you can control the effect of the
          <Backspace> and <Delete> keys, on both dumb terminals and a
          windowed displays, by customizing the option
          `normal-erase-is-backspace-mode', or by invoking `M-x
          normal-erase-is-backspace'.  See the documentation of these
          symbols (*note Emacs Lisp documentation::) for more info.

        - It is possible to swap the <Backspace> and <DEL> keys inside
          Emacs:

               (keyboard-translate ?\C-h ?\C-?)

          This is the recommended method of forcing <Backspace> to act
          as <DEL>, because it works even in modes which bind <DEL> to
          something other than `delete-backward-char'.

          Similarly, you could remap <DEL> to act as `C-d', which by
          default deletes forward:

               (keyboard-translate ?\C-? ?\C-d)

          *Note Swapping keys::, for further details about
          `keyboard-translate'.

        - Another approach is to switch key bindings and put help on
          `C-x h' instead:

               (global-set-key "\C-h" 'delete-backward-char)
               
               ;;; overrides mark-whole-buffer
               (global-set-key "\C-xh" 'help-command)

          This method is not recommended, though: it only solves the
          problem for those modes which bind <DEL> to
          `delete-backward-char'.  Modes which bind <DEL> to something
          else, such as `view-mode', will not work as you expect when
          you press the <Backspace> key.  For this reason, we recommend
          the the `keyboard-translate' method, shown above.

          Other popular key bindings for help are `M-?' and `C-x ?'.

     Don't try to bind <DEL> to `help-command', because there are many
     modes that have local bindings of <DEL> that will interfere.


   When Emacs 21 or later runs on a windowed display, it binds the
<Delete> key to a command which deletes the character at point, to make
Emacs more consistent with keyboard operation on these systems.

   For more information about troubleshooting this problem, see *Note
If <DEL> Fails to Delete: (emacs)DEL Does Not Delete.


File: efaq,  Node: stty and Backspace key,  Next: Swapping keys,  Prev: Backspace invokes help,  Up: Key bindings

Why doesn't Emacs look at the `stty' settings for <Backspace> vs. <Delete>?
===========================================================================

   Good question!


File: efaq,  Node: Swapping keys,  Next: Producing C-XXX with the keyboard,  Prev: stty and Backspace key,  Up: Key bindings

How do I swap two keys?
=======================

   In Emacs 19, you can swap two keys (or key sequences) by using the
`keyboard-translate' function.  For example, to turn `C-h' into <DEL>
and <DEL> to `C-h', use

     (keyboard-translate ?\C-h ?\C-?)  ; translate `C-h' to DEL
     (keyboard-translate ?\C-? ?\C-h)  ; translate DEL to `C-h'.

The first key sequence of the pair after the function identifies what is
produced by the keyboard; the second, what is matched for in the
keymaps.

   Keyboard translations are not the same as key bindings in keymaps.
Emacs contains numerous keymaps that apply in different situations, but
there is only one set of keyboard translations, and it applies to every
character that Emacs reads from the terminal.  Keyboard translations
take place at the lowest level of input processing; the keys that are
looked up in keymaps contain the characters that result from keyboard
translation.

   *note Keyboard Translations: (emacs)Keyboard Translations.


File: efaq,  Node: Producing C-XXX with the keyboard,  Next: No Meta key,  Prev: Swapping keys,  Up: Key bindings

How do I produce C-XXX with my keyboard?
========================================

   On terminals (but not under X), some common "aliases" are:

`C-2'  or  `C-<SPC>'
     `C-@'

`C-6'
     `C-^'

`C-7'  or  `C-S--'
     `C-_'

`C-4'
     `C-\'

`C-5'
     `C-]'

`C-/'
     `C-?'

   Often other aliases exist; use the `C-h c' command and try <CTRL>
with all of the digits on your keyboard to see what gets generated.
You can also try the `C-h w' command if you know the name of the
command.


File: efaq,  Node: No Meta key,  Next: No Escape key,  Prev: Producing C-XXX with the keyboard,  Up: Key bindings

What if I don't have a <Meta> key?
==================================

   On many keyboards, the <Alt> key acts as <Meta>, so try it.

   Instead of typing `M-a', you can type `<ESC> a'.  In fact, Emacs
converts `M-a' internally into `<ESC> a' anyway (depending on the value
of `meta-prefix-char').  Note that you press <Meta> and <a> together,
but with <ESC>, you press <ESC>, release it, and then press <a>.


File: efaq,  Node: No Escape key,  Next: Compose Character,  Prev: No Meta key,  Up: Key bindings

What if I don't have an <Escape> key?
=====================================

   Type `C-[' instead.  This should send ASCII code 27 just like an
Escape key would.  `C-3' may also work on some terminal (but not under
X).  For many terminals (notably DEC terminals) <F11> generates <ESC>.
If not, the following form can be used to bind it:

     ;;; F11 is the documented ESC replacement on DEC terminals.
     (define-key function-key-map [f11] [?\e])


File: efaq,  Node: Compose Character,  Next: Binding combinations of modifiers and function keys,  Prev: No Escape key,  Up: Key bindings

Can I make my <Compose Character> key behave like a <Meta> key?
===============================================================

   On a dumb terminal such as a VT220, no.  It is rumored that certain
VT220 clones could have their <Compose> key configured this way.  If
you're using X, you might be able to do this with the `xmodmap' command.


File: efaq,  Node: Binding combinations of modifiers and function keys,  Next: Meta key does not work in xterm,  Prev: Compose Character,  Up: Key bindings

How do I bind a combination of modifier key and function key?
=============================================================

   With Emacs 19 and later, you can represent modified function keys in
vector format by adding prefixes to the function key symbol.  For
example (from the on-line documentation):

     (global-set-key [?\C-x right] 'forward-page)

where `?\C-x' is the Lisp character constant for the character `C-x'.

   You can use the modifier keys <Control>, <Meta>, <Hyper>, <Super>,
<Alt>, and <Shift> with function keys.  To represent these modifiers,
prepend the strings `C-', `M-', `H-', `s-', `A-', and `S-' to the
symbol name.  Here is how to make `H-M-RIGHT' move forward a word:

     (global-set-key [H-M-right] 'forward-word)

   * Not all modifiers are permitted in all situations.  <Hyper>,
     <Super>, and <Alt> are not available on Unix character terminals.
     Non-ASCII keys and mouse events (e.g. `C-=' and `Mouse-1') also
     fall under this category.


   *Note Binding keys to commands::, for general key binding
instructions.

====================================================

   *note Single-Byte Character Set Support: (emacs)Single-Byte
Character Support.

   If the advice in the Emacs manual fails, try all of these methods
before asking for further help:

   * You may have big problems using `mwm' as your window manager.
     (Does anyone know a good generic solution to allow the use of the
     <Meta> key in Emacs with `mwm'?)

   * For X11: Make sure it really is a <Meta> key.  Use `xev' to find
     out what keysym your <Meta> key generates.  It should be either
     `Meta_L' or `Meta_R'.  If it isn't, use `xmodmap' to fix the
     situation.  If <Meta> does generate `Meta_L' or `Meta_R', but
     `M-x' produces a non-ASCII character, put this in your
     `~/.Xdefaults' file:

           XTerm*eightBitInput:   false
           XTerm*eightBitOutput:  true

   * Make sure the `pty' the `xterm' is using is passing 8 bit
     characters.  `stty -a' (or `stty everything') should show `cs8'
     somewhere.  If it shows `cs7' instead, use `stty cs8 -istrip' (or
     `stty pass8') to fix it.

   * If there is an `rlogin' connection between `xterm' and Emacs, the
     `-8' argument may need to be given to rlogin to make it pass all 8
     bits of every character.

   * If Emacs is running on Ultrix, it is reported that evaluating
     `(set-input-mode t nil)' helps.

   * If all else fails, you can make `xterm' generate `<ESC> W' when
     you type `M-W', which is the same conversion Emacs would make if it
     got the `M-W' anyway.  In X11R4, the following resource
     specification will do this:

          XTerm.VT100.EightBitInput: false

     (This changes the behavior of the `insert-eight-bit' action.)

     With older `xterm's, you can specify this behavior with a
     translation:

          XTerm.VT100.Translations: #override \
            Meta<KeyPress>: string(0x1b) insert()

     You might have to replace `Meta' with `Alt'.



File: efaq,  Node: ExtendChar key does not work as Meta,  Prev: Meta key does not work in xterm,  Up: Key bindings

Why doesn't my <ExtendChar> key work as a <Meta> key under HP-UX 8.0 and 9.x?
=============================================================================

   This is a result of an internationalization extension in X11R4 and
the fact that HP is now using this extension.  Emacs assumes that the
`XLookupString' function returns the same result regardless of the
<Meta> key state which is no longer necessarily true.  Until Emacs is
fixed, the temporary kludge is to run this command after each time the
X server is started but preferably before any xterm clients are:

     xmodmap -e 'remove mod1 = Mode_switch'

   This will disable the use of the extra keysyms systemwide, which may
be undesirable if you actually intend to use them.

   *note Single-byte Character Set Support: (emacs)Single-Byte
Character Support.  On a Unix, when Emacs runs on a text-only terminal
display or is invoked with `emacs -nw', you typically need to use
`set-terminal-coding-system' to tell Emacs what the terminal can
display, even after setting the language environment; otherwise
non-ASCII characters will display as `?'.  On other operating systems,
such as MS-DOS and MS-Windows, Emacs queries the OS about the character
set supported by the display, and sets up the required terminal coding
system automatically.

   Emacs 20 and later supports Hebrew characters (ISO 8859-8), but does
not yet support right-to-left character entry and display.

   Joel M. Hoffman <joel@exc.com> has written a Lisp package called
`hebrew.el' that allows right-to-left editing of Hebrew.  It reportedly
works out of the box with Emacs 19, but requires patches for Emacs 18.
Write to Joel if you want the patches or package.

   `hebrew.el' requires a Hebrew screen font, but no other hardware

File: efaq,  Node: Changing the included text prefix,  Next: Saving a copy of outgoing mail,  Prev: Mail and news,  Up: Mail and news

How do I change the included text prefix in mail/news followups?
================================================================

   If you read mail with Rmail or news with Gnus, set the variable
`mail-yank-prefix'.  For VM, set `vm-included-text-prefix'.  For mh-e,
set `mh-ins-buf-prefix'.

   For fancier control of citations, use Supercite.  *Note Supercite::.

   To prevent Emacs from including various headers of the replied-to
message, set the value of `mail-yank-ignored-headers' to an appropriate
regexp.


File: efaq,  Node: Saving a copy of outgoing mail,  Next: Expanding aliases when sending mail,  Prev: Changing the included text prefix,  Up: Mail and news

How do I save a copy of outgoing mail?
======================================

   You can either mail yourself a copy by including a `BCC' header in
the mail message, or store a copy of the message directly to a file by
including an `FCC' header.

   If you use standard mail, you can automatically create a `BCC' to
yourself by putting

     (setq mail-self-blind t)

in your `.emacs' file.  You can automatically include an `FCC' field by
putting something like the following in your `.emacs' file:

     (setq mail-archive-file-name (expand-file-name "~/outgoing"))

   The output file will be in Unix mail format, which can be read
directly by VM, but not always by Rmail.  *Note Learning how to do
something::.

   If you use `mh-e', add an `FCC' or `BCC' field to your components
file.

   It does not work to put `set record filename' in the `.mailrc' file.


File: efaq,  Node: Expanding aliases when sending mail,  Next: Rmail thinks all messages are one big one,  Prev: Saving a copy of outgoing mail,  Up: Mail and news

Why doesn't Emacs expand my aliases when sending mail?
======================================================

   * You must separate multiple addresses in the headers of the mail
     buffer with commas.  This is because Emacs supports RFC822
     standard addresses like this one:

          To: Willy Smith <wks@xpnsv.lwyrs.com>

     However, you do not need to--and probably should not, unless your
     system's version of `/usr/ucb/mail' (a.k.a. `mailx') supports
     RFC822--separate addresses with commas in your `~/.mailrc' file.

   * Emacs normally only reads the `.mailrc' file once per session,
     when you start to compose your first mail message.  If you edit
     `.mailrc', you can type `M-x rebuild-mail-abbrevs <RET>' to make
     Emacs reread `~/.mailrc'.

   * If you like, you can expand mail aliases as abbrevs, as soon as you
     type them in.  To enable this feature, execute the following:

          (add-hook 'mail-mode-hook 'mail-abbrevs-setup)

     Note that the aliases are expanded automatically only after you
     type <RET> or a punctuation character (e.g. `,').  You can force
     their expansion by moving point to the end of the alias and typing
     `C-x a e' (`M-x expand-abbrev').


File: efaq,  Node: Rmail thinks all messages are one big one,  Next: Sorting the messages in an Rmail folder,  Prev: Expanding aliases when sending mail,  Up: Mail and news

Why does Rmail think all my saved messages are one big message?
===============================================================

   A file created through the `FCC' field in a message is in Unix mail
format, not the format that Rmail uses (BABYL format).  Rmail will try
to convert a Unix mail file into BABYL format on input, but sometimes it
makes errors.  For guaranteed safety, you can make the `saved-messages'
file be an inbox for your Rmail file by using the function
`set-rmail-inbox-list'.


File: efaq,  Node: Sorting the messages in an Rmail folder,  Next: Rmail writes to /usr/spool/mail,  Prev: Rmail thinks all messages are one big one,  Up: Mail and news

How can I sort the messages in my Rmail folder?
===============================================

   In Rmail, type `C-c C-s C-h' to get a list of sorting functions and
their key bindings.


File: efaq,  Node: Rmail writes to /usr/spool/mail,  Next: Recovering mail files when Rmail munges them,  Prev: Sorting the messages in an Rmail folder,  Up: Mail and news

Why does Rmail need to write to `/usr/spool/mail'?
==================================================

   This is the behavior of the `movemail' program which Rmail uses.
This indicates that `movemail' is configured to use lock files.

   RMS writes:

     Certain systems require lock files to interlock access to mail
     files.  On these systems, `movemail' must write lock files, or you
     risk losing mail.  You simply must arrange to let `movemail' write
     them.

     Other systems use the `flock' system call to interlock access.  On
     these systems, you should configure `movemail' to use `flock'.


File: efaq,  Node: Recovering mail files when Rmail munges them,  Next: Replying to the sender of a message,  Prev: Rmail writes to /usr/spool/mail,  Up: Mail and news

How do I recover my mail files after Rmail munges their format?
===============================================================

   If you have just done `M-x rmail-input' on a file and you don't want
to save it in Rmail's format (called BABYL), just kill the buffer (with
`C-x k').

   If you typed `M-x rmail' and it read some messages out of your inbox
and you want to put them in a Unix mail file, use `C-o' on each message.

   If you want to convert an existing file from BABYL format to Unix
mail format, use the command `M-x unrmail': it will prompt you for the
input and output file names.

   Alternatively, you could use the `b2m' program supplied with Emacs.
`b2m' is a filter, and is used like this:

      b2m < BABYL-FILE > MBOX-FILE

where BABYL-FILE is the name of the BABYL file, and MBOX-FILE is the
name of the file where the converted mail will be written.

How can I force Rmail to reply to the sender of a message, but not the other recipients?
========================================================================================

   Ron Isaacson <isaacson@seas.upenn.edu> says: When you hit <r> to
reply in Rmail, by default it CCs all of the original recipients
(everyone on the original `To' and `CC' lists). With a prefix argument
(i.e., typing `C-u' before <r>), it replies only to the sender.
However, going through the whole `C-u' business every time you want to
reply is a pain.  This is the best fix I've been able to come up with:

     (defun rmail-reply-t ()
       "Reply only to the sender of the current message. (See rmail-reply.)"
       (interactive)
       (rmail-reply t))
     
     (add-hook 'rmail-mode-hook
       (lambda ()
         (define-key rmail-mode-map "r" 'rmail-reply-t)
         (define-key rmail-mode-map "R" 'rmail-reply)))

How can I get my favorite Emacs mail package to support MIME?
=============================================================

   Read the Emacs MIME FAQ, maintained by MacDonald Hall Jackson
<trey@cs.berkeley.edu> at

   `http://bmrc.berkeley.edu/~trey/emacs/mime.html'

   Version 6.x of VM supports MIME.  *Note VM::.  Gnus supports MIME in
mail and news messages as of version 5.8.1 (Pterodactyl).  Rmail has
limited support for single-part MIME messages beginning with Emacs 20.3.


File: efaq,  Node: Automatically starting a mail or news reader,  Next: Reading news with Emacs,  Prev: MIME with Emacs mail packages,  Up: Mail and news

How do I make Emacs automatically start my mail/news reader?
============================================================

   To start Emacs in Gnus:

     emacs -f gnus

in Rmail:

     emacs -f rmail

   A more convenient way to start with Gnus:

     alias gnus 'emacs -f gnus'
     gnus

   It is probably unwise to automatically start your mail or news reader
from your `.emacs' file.  This would cause problems if you needed to run
two copies of Emacs at the same time.  Also, this would make it
difficult for you to start Emacs quickly when you needed to.

File: efaq,  Node: Gnus does not work with NNTP,  Next: Viewing articles with embedded underlining,  Prev: Reading news with Emacs,  Up: Mail and news

Why doesn't Gnus work via NNTP?
===============================

   There is a bug in NNTP version 1.5.10, such that when multiple
requests are sent to the NNTP server, the server only handles the first
one before blocking waiting for more input which never comes.  NNTP
version 1.5.11 claims to fix this.

   You can work around the bug inside Emacs like this:

     (setq nntp-maximum-request 1)

   You can find out what version of NNTP your news server is running by
telnetting to the NNTP port (usually 119) on the news server machine
(i.e., `telnet server-machine 119').  The server should give its
version number in the welcome message.  Type `quit' to get out.

ideas.


File: efaq,  Node: Viewing articles with embedded underlining,  Next: Saving a multi-part Gnus posting,  Prev: Gnus does not work with NNTP,  Up: Mail and news

How do I view news articles with embedded underlining (e.g., ClariNews)?
========================================================================

   Underlining appears like this:

     _^Hu_^Hn_^Hd_^He_^Hr_^Hl_^Hi_^Hn_^Hi_^Hn_^Hg

   Per Abrahamsen <abraham@dina.kvl.dk> suggests using the following
code, which uses the underline face to turn such text into true
underlining, inconjunction with Gnus:

     (defun gnus-article-prepare-overstrike ()
       ;; Prepare article for overstrike commands.
       (save-excursion
         (set-buffer gnus-article-buffer)
         (let ((buffer-read-only nil))
         (goto-char (point-min))
           (while (search-forward "\b" nil t)
             (let ((next (following-char))
                   (previous (char-after (- (point) 2))))
               (cond ((eq next previous)
                      (delete-region (- (point) 2) (point))
                      (put-text-property (point) (1+ (point))
                                         'face 'bold))
                     ((eq next ?_)
                      (delete-region (1- (point)) (1+ (point)))
                      (put-text-property (1- (point)) (point)
                                         'face 'underline))
                     ((eq previous ?_)
                      (delete-region (- (point) 2) (point))
                      (put-text-property (point) (1+ (point))
                                         'face 'underline))))))))
     
     (add-hook 'gnus-article-prepare-hook 'gnus-article-prepare-overstrike)

   Latest versions of Gnus do such a conversion automatically.

   If you prefer to do away with underlining altogether, you can
destructively remove it with `M-x ununderline-region'; do this
automatically via

     (add-hook 'gnus-article-prepare-hook
       (lambda () (ununderline-region (point-min) (point-max))))

==========================================================================

   Gnus will complain that the `Newsgroups', `Keywords', and `Control'
headers are "Unknown header" fields.

   For the `Newsgroups' header, there is an easy workaround: kill on the
`Xref' header instead, which will be present on any cross-posted article
(as long as your site carries the cross-post group).

   If you really want to kill on one of these headers, you can do it
like this:

Why does Gnus hang for a long time when posting?
================================================

   David Lawrence <tale@uunet.uu.net> explains:

     The problem is almost always interaction between NNTP and C News.
     NNTP POST asks C News's `inews' to not background itself but
     rather hang around and give its exit status so it knows whether
     the post was successful.  (That wait will on some systems not
     return the exit status of the waited for job is a different sort
     of problem.)  It ends up taking a long time because `inews' is
     calling `relaynews', which often waits for another `relaynews' to
     free the lock on the news system so it can file the article.

     My preferred solution is to change `inews' to not call
     `relaynews', but rather use `newsspool'.  This loses some
     error-catching functionality, but is for the most part safe as
     `inews' will detect a lot of the errors on its own.  The C News
     folks have sped up `inews', too, so speed should look better to
     most folks as that update propagates around.
