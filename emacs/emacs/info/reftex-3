Optimizations
=============

   Implementing the principle of least surprises, the default settings
of RefTeX ensure a safe ride for beginners and casual users.  However,
when using RefTeX for a large project and/or on a small computer, there
are ways to improve speed or memory usage.

   * Removing Lookup Buffers
     RefTeX will load other parts of a multifile document as well as
     BibTeX database files for lookup purposes.  These buffers are
     kept, so that subsequent use of the same files is fast.  If you
     can't afford keeping these buffers around, and if you can live
     with a speed penalty, try

          (setq reftex-keep-temporary-buffers nil)

   * Partial Document Scans
     A `C-u' prefix on the major RefTeX commands `reftex-label' (`C-u
     C-c ('), `reftex-reference' (`C-u C-c )'), `reftex-citation' (`C-u
     C-c ['), `reftex-toc' (`C-u C-c ='), and `reftex-view-crossref'
     (`C-u C-c &') initiates re-parsing of the entire document in order
     to update the parsing information.  For a large document this can
     be unnecessary, in particular if only one file has changed.
     RefTeX can be configured to do partial scans instead of full ones.
     `C-u' re-parsing then does apply only to the current buffer and
     files included from it.  Likewise, the `r' key in both the label
     selection buffer and the table-of-contents buffer will only prompt
     scanning of the file in which the label or section macro near the
     cursor was defined.  Re-parsing of the entire document is still
     available by using `C-u C-u' as a prefix, or the capital `R' key
     in the menus.  To use this feature, try

          (setq reftex-enable-partial-scans t)

   * Saving Parser Information
     Even with partial scans enabled, RefTeX still has to make one full
     scan, when you start working with a document.  To avoid this,
     parsing information can be stored in a file.  The file
     `MASTER.rel' is used for storing information about a document with
     master file `MASTER.tex'.  It is written automatically when you
     kill a buffer in `reftex-mode' or when you exit Emacs.  The
     information is restored when you begin working with a document in
     a new editing session.  To use this feature, put into `.emacs':

          (setq reftex-save-parse-info t)

   * Automatic Document Scans
     At rare occasions, RefTeX will automatically rescan a part of the
     document.  If this gets into your way, it can be turned off with

          (setq reftex-allow-automatic-rescan nil)

     RefTeX will then occasionally annotate new labels in the selection
     buffer, saying that their position in the label list in uncertain.
     A manual document scan will fix this.

   * Multiple Selection Buffers
     Normally, the selection buffer `*RefTeX Select*' is re-created for
     every selection process.  In documents with very many labels this
     can take several seconds.  RefTeX provides an option to create a
     separate selection buffer for each label type and to keep this
     buffer from one selection to the next.  These buffers are updated
     automatically only when a new label has been added in the buffers
     category with `reftex-label'.  Updating the buffer takes as long
     as recreating it - so the time saving is limited to cases where no
     new labels of that category have been added.  To turn on this
     feature, use

          (setq reftex-use-multiple-selection-buffers t)

     You can also inhibit the automatic updating entirely.  Then the
     selection buffer will always pop up very fast, but may not contain
     the most recently defined labels.  You can always update the
     buffer by hand, with the `g' key.  To get this behavior, use
     instead

          (setq reftex-use-multiple-selection-buffers t
                reftex-auto-update-selection-buffers nil)

As a summary, here are the settings I recommend for heavy use of RefTeX
with large documents:

     (setq reftex-enable-partial-scans t
           reftex-save-parse-info t
           reftex-use-multiple-selection-buffers t)

The AUCTeX-RefTeX Interface
---------------------------

   RefTeX contains code to interface with AUCTeX.  When this interface
is turned on, both packages will interact closely.  Instead of using
RefTeX's commands directly, you can then also use them indirectly as
part of the AUCTeX environment(1).  The interface is turned on with

     (setq reftex-plug-into-AUCTeX t)

   If you need finer control about which parts of the interface are used
and which not, read the docstring of the variable
`reftex-plug-into-AUCTeX' or customize it with `M-x customize-variable
<RET> reftex-plug-into-AUCTeX <RET>'.

   The following list describes the individual parts of the interface.

   * AUCTeX calls `reftex-label' to insert labels
     When a new section is created with `C-c C-s', or a new environment
     is inserted with `C-c C-e', AUCTeX normally prompts for a label to
     go with it.  With the interface, `reftex-label' is called instead.
     For example, if you type `C-c C-e equation <RET>', AUCTeX and
     RefTeX will insert

          \begin{equation}
          \label{eq:1}
          
          \end{equation}

     without further prompts.

     Similarly, when you type `C-c C-s section <RET>', RefTeX will
     offer its default label which is derived from the section title.

   * AUCTeX tells RefTeX about new sections
     When creating a new section with `C-c C-s', RefTeX will not have
     to rescan the buffer in order to see it.

   * RefTeX supplies macro arguments
     When you insert a macro interactively with `C-c <RET>', AUCTeX
     normally prompts for macro arguments.  Internally, it uses the
     functions `TeX-arg-label', `TeX-arg-cite', and `TeX-arg-index' to
     prompt for arguments which are labels, citation keys and index
     entries.  The interface takes over these functions(2) and supplies
     the macro arguments with RefTeX's mechanisms.  For example, when
     you type `C-c <RET> ref <RET>', RefTeX will supply its label
     selection process (*note Referencing Labels::).

   * RefTeX tells AUCTeX about new labels, citation- and index keys
     RefTeX will add all newly created labels to AUCTeX's completion
     list.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) RefTeX 4.0 and AUCTeX 9.10c will be needed for all of this to
work.  Parts of it work also with earlier versions.

   (2) `fset' is used to do this, which is not reversible.  However,
RefTeX implements the old functionality when you later decide to turn
off the interface.

Style Files
-----------

   Style files are Emacs Lisp files which are evaluated by AUCTeX in
association with the `\documentclass' and `\usepackage' commands of a
document (*note Style Files: (auctex)Style Files.). Support for RefTeX
in such a style file is useful when the LaTeX style defines macros or
environments connected with labels, citations, or the index.  Many
style files (e.g. `amsmath.el' or `natbib.el') distributed with AUCTeX
already support RefTeX in this way.

   Before calling a RefTeX function, the style hook should always test
for the availability of the function, so that the style file will also
work for people who do not use RefTeX.

   Additions made with style files in the way described below remain
local to the current document.  For example, if one package uses
AMSTeX, the style file will make RefTeX switch over to `\eqref', but
this will not affect other documents.

   A style hook may contain calls to `reftex-add-label-environments'(1)
which defines additions to `reftex-label-alist'.  The argument taken
by this function must have the same format as `reftex-label-alist'.
The `amsmath.el' style file of AUCTeX for example contains the
following:

     (TeX-add-style-hook "amsmath"
        (lambda ()
          (if (fboundp 'reftex-add-label-environments)
              (reftex-add-label-environments '(AMSTeX)))))

while a package `myprop' defining a `proposition' environment with
`\newtheorem' might use

     (TeX-add-style-hook "myprop"
        (lambda ()
          (LaTeX-add-environments '("proposition" LaTeX-env-label))
          (if (fboundp 'reftex-add-label-environments)
              (reftex-add-label-environments
               '(("proposition" ?p "prop:" "~\\ref{%s}" t
                                ("Proposition" "Prop.") -3))))))

   Similarly, a style hook may contain a call to
`reftex-set-cite-format' to set the citation format.  The style file
`natbib.el' for the Natbib citation style does switch RefTeX's citation
format like this:

     (TeX-add-style-hook "natbib"
        (lambda ()
          (if (fboundp 'reftex-set-cite-format)
              (reftex-set-cite-format 'natbib))))

   The hook may contain a call to `reftex-add-index-macros' to define
additional `\index'-like macros.  The argument must have the same
format as `reftex-index-macros'.  It may be a symbol, to trigger
support for one of the builtin index packages.  For example, the style
`multind.el' contains

     (TeX-add-style-hook "multind"
       (lambda ()
         (and (fboundp 'reftex-add-index-macros)
     	 (reftex-add-index-macros '(multind)))))

   If you have your own package `myindex' which defines the following
macros to be used with the LaTeX `index.sty' file
     \newcommand{\molec}[1]{#1\index{Molecules!#1}}
     \newcommand{\aindex}[1]{#1\index[author]{#1}

   you could write this in the style file `myindex.el':

     (TeX-add-style-hook "myindex"
        (lambda ()
          (TeX-add-symbols
           '("molec" TeX-arg-index)
           '("aindex" TeX-arg-index))
          (if (fboundp 'reftex-add-index-macros)
              (reftex-add-index-macros
               '(("molec{*}" "idx" ?m "Molecules!" nil nil)
                 ("aindex{*}" "author" ?a "" nil nil))))))

   Finally the hook may contain a call to `reftex-add-section-levels'
to define additional section statements.  For example, the FoilTeX class
has just two headers, `\foilhead' and `\rotatefoilhead'.  Here is a
style file `foils.el' that will inform RefTeX about these:

     (TeX-add-style-hook "foils"
        (lambda ()
          (if (fboundp 'reftex-add-section-levels)
              (reftex-add-section-levels '(("foilhead" . 3)
                                           ("rotatefoilhead" . 3))))))

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This used to be the function `reftex-add-to-label-alist' which
is still available as an alias for compatibility.


File: reftex,  Node: Bib-Cite,  Prev: Style Files,  Up: AUCTeX

Bib-Cite
--------

   Once you have written a document with labels, references and
citations, it can be nice to read it like a hypertext document.  RefTeX
has support for that: `reftex-view-crossref' (bound to `C-c &'),
`reftex-mouse-view-crossref' (bound to `S-mouse-2'), and
`reftex-search-document'.  A somewhat fancier interface with mouse
highlighting is provided (among other things) by Peter S. Galbraith's
`bib-cite.el'.  There is some overlap in the functionalities of
Bib-cite and RefTeX.  Bib-cite.el comes bundled with AUCTeX.

   Bib-cite version 3.06 and later can be configured so that bib-cite's
mouse functions use RefTeX for displaying references and citations.
This can be useful in particular when working with the LaTeX `xr'
package or with an explicit `thebibliography' environment (rather than
BibTeX).  Bib-cite cannot handle those, but RefTeX does.  To make use
of this feature, try

     (setq bib-cite-use-reftex-view-crossref t)


File: reftex,  Node: Problems and Work-Arounds,  Next: Imprint,  Prev: Optimizations,  Up: Top

Problems and Work-arounds
=========================

   * LaTeX commands
     `\input', `\include', `\bibliography' and `\section' (etc.)
     statements have to be first on a line (except for white space).

   * Commented regions
     RefTeX sees also labels in regions commented out and will refuse to
     make duplicates of such labels.  This is considered to be a
     feature.

   * Wrong section numbers
     When using partial scans (`reftex-enable-partial-scans'), the
     section numbers in the table of contents may eventually become
     wrong.  A full scan will fix this.

   * Local settings
     The label environment definitions in `reftex-label-alist' are
     global and apply to all documents.  If you need to make definitions
     local to a document, because they would interfere with settings in
     other documents, you should use AUCTeX and set up style files with
     calls to `reftex-add-label-environments', `reftex-set-cite-format',
     `reftex-add-index-macros', and `reftex-add-section-levels'.
     Settings made with these functions remain local to the current
     document. *Note AUCTeX::.

   * Funny display in selection buffer
     When using packages which make the buffer representation of a file
     different from its disk representation (e.g. x-symbol, isotex,
     iso-cvt) you may find that RefTeX's parsing information sometimes
     reflects the disk state of a file.  This happens only in
     _unvisited_ parts of a multifile document, because RefTeX visits
     these files literally for speed reasons.  Then both short context
     and section headings may look different from what you usually see
     on your screen.  In rare cases `reftex-toc' may have problems to
     jump to an affected section heading.  There are three possible
     ways to deal with this:
        - `(setq reftex-keep-temporary-buffers t)'
          This implies that RefTeX will load all parts of a multifile
          document into Emacs (i.e. there won't be any temporary
          buffers).

        - `(setq reftex-initialize-temporary-buffers t)'
          This means full initialization of temporary buffers.  It
          involves a penalty when the same unvisited file is used for
          lookup often.

        - Set `reftex-initialize-temporary-buffers' to a list of hook
          functions doing a minimal initialization.
     See also the variable `reftex-refontify-context'.

   * Labels as arguments to \begin
     Some packages use an additional argument to a `\begin' macro to
     specify a label.  E.g. Lamport's `pf.sty' uses both
          \step{LABEL}{CLAIM}   and      \begin{step+}{LABEL}
                                            CLAIM
                                         \end{step+}

     We need to trick RefTeX into swallowing this:

          ;; Configuration for Lamport's pf.sty
          (setq reftex-label-alist
            '(("\\step{*}{}"       ?p "st:" "~\\stepref{%s}" 2 ("Step" "St."))
              ("\\begin{step+}{*}" ?p "st:" "~\\stepref{%s}" 1000)))

     The first line is just a normal configuration for a macro.  For the
     `step+' environment we actually tell RefTeX to look for the
     _macro_ `\begin{step+}' and interpret the _first_ argument (which
     really is a second argument to the macro `\begin') as a label of
     type `?p'.  Argument count for this macro starts only after the
     `{step+}', also when specifying how to get context.

   * Idle timers in XEmacs
     In XEmacs, idle timer restart does not work reliably after fast
     keystrokes.  Therefore RefTeX currently uses the post command hook
     to start the timer used for automatic crossref information.  When
     this bug gets fixed, a real idle timer can be requested with
          (setq reftex-use-itimer-in-xemacs t)

   * Viper mode
     With Viper mode prior to Vipers version 3.01, you need to protect
     RefTeX's keymaps with

          (viper-harness-minor-mode "reftex")

Commands
********

   Here is a summary of RefTeX's commands which can be executed from
LaTeX files.  Command which are executed from the special buffers are
not described here.  All commands are available from the `Ref' menu.
See *Note Key Bindings::.

 - Command: reftex-toc
     Show the table of contents for the current document.  When called
     with one ore two `C-u' prefixes, rescan the document first.

 - Command: reftex-label
     Insert a unique label.  With one or two `C-u' prefixes, enforce
     document rescan first.

 - Command: reftex-reference
     Start a selection process to select a label, and insert a
     reference to it.  With one or two `C-u' prefixes, enforce document
     rescan first.

 - Command: reftex-citation
     Make a citation using BibTeX database files.  After prompting for
     a regular expression, scans the buffers with BibTeX entries (taken
     from the `\bibliography' command or a `thebibliography'
     environment) and offers the matching entries for selection.  The
     selected entry is formated according to `reftex-cite-format' and
     inserted into the buffer.
     When called with one or two `C-u' prefixes, first rescans the
     document.  When called with a numeric prefix, make that many
     citations.  When called with point inside the braces of a `\cite'
     command, it will add another key, ignoring the value of
     `reftex-cite-format'.
     The regular expression uses an expanded syntax: `&&' is interpreted
     as `and'.  Thus, `aaaa&&bbb' matches entries which contain both
     `aaaa' and `bbb'.  While entering the regexp, completion on knows
     citation keys is possible.  `=' is a good regular expression to
     match all entries in all files.

 - Command: reftex-index
     Query for an index macro and insert it along with its arguments.
     The index macros available are those defined in
     `reftex-index-macro' or by a call to `reftex-add-index-macros',
     typically from an AUCTeX style file.  RefTeX provides completion
     for the index tag and the index key, and will prompt for other
     arguments.

 - Command: reftex-index-selection-or-word
     Put current selection or the word near point into the default index
     macro.  This uses the information in `reftex-index-default-macro'
     to make an index entry.  The phrase indexed is the current
     selection or the word near point.  When called with one `C-u'
     prefix, let the user have a chance to edit the index entry.  When
     called with 2 `C-u' as prefix, also ask for the index macro and
     other stuff.  When called inside TeX math mode as determined by
     the `texmathp.el' library which is part of AUCTeX, the string is
     first processed with the `reftex-index-math-format', which see.

 - Command: reftex-index-phrase-selection-or-word
     Add current selection or the word at point to the phrases buffer.
     When you are in transient-mark-mode and the region is active, the
     selection will be used - otherwise the word at point.  You get a
     chance to edit the entry in the phrases buffer - to save the
     buffer and return to the LaTeX document, finish with `C-c C-c'.

 - Command: reftex-index-visit-phrases-buffer
     Switch to the phrases buffer, initialize if empty.

 - Command: reftex-index-phrases-apply-to-region
     Index all index phrases in the current region.  This works exactly
     like global indexing from the index phrases buffer, but operation
     is restricted to the current region.

 - Command: reftex-display-index
     Display a buffer with an index compiled from the current document.
     When the document has multiple indices, first prompts for the
     correct one.  When index support is turned off, offer to turn it
     on.  With one or two `C-u' prefixes, rescan document first.  With
     prefix 2, restrict index to current document section.  With prefix
     3, restrict index to active region.

 - Command: reftex-view-crossref
     View cross reference of macro at point.  Point must be on the KEY
     argument.  Works with the macros `\label', `\ref', `\cite',
     `\bibitem', `\index' and many derivatives of these.  Where it
     makes sense, subsequent calls show additional locations.  See also
     the variable `reftex-view-crossref-extra' and the command
     `reftex-view-crossref-from-bibtex'.  With one or two `C-u'
     prefixes, enforce rescanning of the document.  With argument 2,
     select the window showing the cross reference.

 - Command: reftex-view-crossref-from-bibtex
     View location in a LaTeX document which cites the BibTeX entry at
     point.  Since BibTeX files can be used by many LaTeX documents,
     this function prompts upon first use for a buffer in RefTeX mode.
     To reset this link to a document, call the function with with a
     prefix arg.  Calling this function several times find successive
     citation locations.

 - Command: reftex-create-tags-file
     Create TAGS file by running `etags' on the current document.  The
     TAGS file is also immediately visited with `visit-tags-table'.

 - Command: reftex-grep-document
     Run grep query through all files related to this document.  With
     prefix arg, force to rescan document.  No active TAGS table is
     required.

 - Command: reftex-search-document
     Regexp search through all files of the current document.  Starts
     always in the master file.  Stops when a match is found.  No
     active TAGS table is required.

 - Command: reftex-query-replace-document
     Run a query-replace-regexp of FROM with TO over the entire
     document.  With prefix arg, replace only word-delimited matches.
     No active TAGS table is required.

 - Command: reftex-change-label
     Query replace FROM with TO in all `\label' and `\ref' commands.
     Works on the entire multifile document.  No active TAGS table is
     required.

 - Command: reftex-renumber-simple-labels
     Renumber all simple labels in the document to make them
     sequentially.  Simple labels are the ones created by RefTeX,
     consisting only of the prefix and a number.  After the command
     completes, all these labels will have sequential numbers
     throughout the document.  Any references to the labels will be
     changed as well.  For this, RefTeX looks at the arguments of any
     macros which either start or end with the string `ref'.  This
     command should be used with care, in particular in multifile
     documents.  You should not use it if another document refers to
     this one with the `xr' package.

 - Command: reftex-find-duplicate-labels
     Produce a list of all duplicate labels in the document.

 - Command: reftex-customize
     Run the customize browser on the RefTeX group.

 - Command: reftex-show-commentary
     Show the commentary section from `reftex.el'.

 - Command: reftex-info
     Run info on the top RefTeX node.

 - Command: reftex-parse-document
     Parse the entire document in order to update the parsing
     information.

 - Command: reftex-reset-mode
     Enforce rebuilding of several internal lists and variables.  Also
     removes the parse file associated with the current document.

Table of Contents
=================

 - User Option: reftex-toc-max-level
     The maximum level of toc entries which will be included in the TOC.
     Section headings with a bigger level will be ignored.  In RefTeX,
     chapters are level 1, sections level 2 etc.  This variable can be
     changed from within the `*toc*' buffer with the `t' key.

 - User Option: reftex-toc-keep-other-windows
     Non-`nil' means, split the selected window to display the `*toc*'
     buffer.  This helps to keep the window configuration, but makes
     the `*toc*' small.  When `nil', all other windows except the
     selected one will be deleted, so that the `*toc*' window fills
     half the frame.

 - User Option: reftex-toc-include-file-boundaries
     Non-`nil' means, include file boundaries in `*toc*' buffer.  This
     flag can be toggled from within the `*toc*' buffer with the `i'
     key.

 - User Option: reftex-toc-include-labels
     Non-`nil' means, include labels in `*toc*' buffer.  This flag can
     be toggled from within the `*toc*' buffer with the `l' key.

 - User Option: reftex-toc-include-index-entries
     Non-`nil' means, include index entries in `*toc*' buffer.  This
     flag can be toggled from within the `*toc*' buffer with the `i'
     key.

 - User Option: reftex-toc-include-context
     Non-`nil' means, include context with labels in the `*toc*'
     buffer.  Context will only be shown if the labels are visible as
     well.  This flag can be toggled from within the `*toc*' buffer
     with the `c' key.

 - User Option: reftex-toc-follow-mode
     Non-`nil' means, point in `*toc*' buffer (the table-of-contents
     buffer) will cause other window to follow.  The other window will
     show the corresponding part of the document.  This flag can be
     toggled from within the `*toc*' buffer with the `f' key.

 - Normal Hook: reftex-toc-mode-hook
     Normal hook which is run when a `*toc*' buffer is created.

 - Keymap: reftex-toc-map
     The keymap which is active in the `*toc*' buffer.  (*note Table of
     Contents::).

Defining Label Environments
===========================

 - User Option: reftex-default-label-alist-entries
     Default label alist specifications.  It is a list of symbols with
     associations in the constant `reftex-label-alist-builtin'.
     `LaTeX' should always be the last entry.

 - User Option: reftex-label-alist
     Set this variable to define additions and changes to the defaults
     in `reftex-default-label-alist-entries'.  The only things you
     _must not_ change is that `?s' is the type indicator for section
     labels, and <SPC> for the `any' label type.  These are hard-coded
     at other places in the code.

     The value of the variable must be a list of items.  Each item is a
     list itself and has the following structure:

           (ENV-OR-MACRO  TYPE-KEY  LABEL-PREFIX  REFERENCE-FORMAT
              CONTEXT-METHOD  (MAGIC-WORD ... )  TOC-LEVEL)

     Each list entry describes either an environment carrying a counter
     for use with `\label' and `\ref', or a LaTeX macro defining a
     label as (or inside) one of its arguments.  The elements of each
     list entry are:

    ENV-OR-MACRO
          Name of the environment (like `table') or macro (like
          `\myfig').  For macros, indicate the arguments, as in
          `\myfig[]{}{}{*}{}'.  Use square brackets for optional
          arguments, a star to mark the label argument, if any.  The
          macro does not have to have a label argument - you could also
          use `\label{...}' inside one of its arguments.

          Special names: `section' for section labels, `any' to define a
          group which contains all labels.

          This may also be a function to do local parsing and identify
          point to be in a a non-standard label environment.  The
          function must take an argument BOUND and limit backward
          searches to this value.  It should return either nil or a
          cons cell `(FUNCTION . POSITION)' with the function symbol
          and the position where the special environment starts.  See
          the Info documentation for an example.

          Finally this may also be `nil' if the entry is only meant to
          change some settings associated with the type indicator
          character (see below).

    TYPE-KEY
          Type indicator character, like `?t', must be a printable ASCII
          character.  The type indicator is a single character which
          defines a label type.  Any label inside the environment or
          macro is assumed to belong to this type.  The same character
          may occur several times in this list, to cover cases in which
          different environments carry the same label type (like
          `equation' and `eqnarray').  If the type indicator is `nil'
          and the macro has a label argument `{*}', the macro defines
          neutral labels just like `\label'.  In this case the reminder
          of this entry is ignored.

    LABEL-PREFIX
          Label prefix string, like `tab:'.  The prefix is a short
          string used as the start of a label.  It may be the empty
          string.  The prefix may contain the following `%' escapes:

               %f Current file name, directory and extension stripped.
               %F Current file name relative to master file directory.
               %u User login name, on systems which support this.
               %S A section prefix derived with variable `reftex-section-prefixes'.

          Example: In a file `intro.tex', `eq:%f:' will become
          `eq:intro:'.

    REFERENCE-FORMAT
          Format string for reference insert in buffer.  `%s' will be
          replaced by the label.  When the format starts with `~', this
          `~' will only be inserted when the character before point is
          _not_ a whitespace.

    CONTEXT-METHOD
          Indication on how to find the short context.
             - If `nil', use the text following the `\label{...}' macro.

             - If `t', use
                  - the section heading for section labels.

                  - text following the `\begin{...}' statement of
                    environments (not a good choice for environments
                    like eqnarray or enumerate, where one has several
                    labels in a single environment).

                  - text after the macro name (starting with the first
                    arg) for macros.

             - If an integer, use the nth argument of the macro.  As a
               special case, 1000 means to get text after the last
               macro argument.

             - If a string, use as regexp to search _backward_ from the
               label.  Context is then the text following the end of
               the match.  E.g. putting this to `\\caption[[{]' will
               use the caption in a figure or table environment.
               `\\begin{eqnarray}\|\\\\' works for eqnarrays.

             - If any of `caption', `item', `eqnarray-like',
               `alignat-like', this symbol will internally be
               translated into an appropriate regexp (see also the
               variable `reftex-default-context-regexps').

             - If a function, call this function with the name of the
               environment/macro as argument.  On call, point will be
               just after the `\label' macro.  The function is expected
               to return a suitable context string.  It should throw an
               exception (error) when failing to find context.  As an
               example, here is a function returning the 10 chars
               following the label macro as context:

                    (defun my-context-function (env-or-mac)
                       (if (> (point-max) (+ 10 (point)))
                           (buffer-substring (point) (+ 10 (point)))
                         (error "Buffer too small")))

          Label context is used in two ways by RefTeX: For display in
          the label menu, and to derive a label string.  If you want to
          use a different method for each of these, specify them as a
          dotted pair.  E.g. `(nil . t)' uses the text after the label
          (`nil') for display, and text from the default position (`t')
          to derive a label string.  This is actually used for section
          labels.

    MAGIC-WORD-LIST
          List of magic words which identify a reference to be of this
          type.  If the word before point is equal to one of these
          words when calling `reftex-reference', the label list offered
          will be automatically restricted to labels of the correct
          type.  If the first element of this word-list is the symbol
          `regexp', the strings are interpreted as regular expressions.

    TOC-LEVEL
          The integer level at which this environment should be added
          to the table of contents.  See also `reftex-section-levels'.
          A positive value will number the entries mixed with the
          sectioning commands of the same level.  A negative value will
          make unnumbered entries.  Useful only for theorem-like
          environments which structure the document.  Will be ignored
          for macros.  When omitted or `nil', no TOC entries will be
          made.

     If the type indicator characters of two or more entries are the
     same, RefTeX will use
        - the first non-`nil' format and prefix

        - the magic words of all involved entries.

     Any list entry may also be a symbol.  If that has an association in
     `reftex-label-alist-builtin', the `cddr' of that association is
     spliced into the list.  However, builtin defaults should normally
     be set with the variable `reftex-default-label-alist-entries'.

 - User Option: reftex-max-section-depth
     Maximum depth of section levels in document structure.  Standard
     LaTeX needs 7, default is 12.

 - User Option: reftex-section-levels
     Commands and levels used for defining sections in the document.
     The `car' of each cons cell is the name of the section macro.  The
     `cdr' is a number indicating its level.  A negative level means the
     same as the positive value, but the section will never get a
     number.  The `cdr' may also be a function which then has to return
     the level.

 - User Option: reftex-section-prefixes
     Prefixes for section labels.  When the label prefix given in an
     entry in `reftex-label-alist' contains `%S', this list is used to
     determine the correct prefix string depending on the current
     section level.  The list is an alist, with each entry of the form
     `(KEY . PREFIX)'. Possible keys are sectioning macro names like
     `chapter', integer section levels (as given in
     `reftex-section-levels'), and `t' for the default.

 - User Option: reftex-default-context-regexps
     Alist with default regular expressions for finding context.  The
     emacs lisp form `(format regexp (regexp-quote environment))' is
     used to calculate the final regular expression - so `%s' will be
     replaced with the environment or macro.

Creating Labels
===============

 - User Option: reftex-insert-label-flags
     Flags governing label insertion.  The value has the form

          (DERIVE PROMPT)

     If DERIVEis `t', RefTeX will try to derive a sensible label from
     context.  A section label for example will be derived from the
     section heading.  The conversion of the context to a legal label is
     governed by the specifications given in
     `reftex-derive-label-parameters'.  If DERIVE is `nil', the default
     label will consist of the prefix and a unique number, like `eq:23'.

     If PROMPT is `t', the user will be prompted for a label string.
     When PROMPT is `nil', the default label will be inserted without
     query.

     So the combination of DERIVE and PROMPT controls label insertion.
     Here is a table describing all four possibilities:

          DERIVE PROMPT ACTION
          -----------------------------------------------------------
          nil    nil    Insert simple label, like `eq:22' or `sec:13'. No query.
          nil    t      Prompt for label.
          t      nil    Derive a label from context and insert. No query.
          t      t      Derive a label from context, prompt for confirmation.

     Each flag may be set to `t', `nil', or a string of label type
     letters indicating the label types for which it should be true.
     Thus, the combination may be set differently for each label type.
     The default settings `"s"' and `"sft"' mean: Derive section labels
     from headings (with confirmation).  Prompt for figure and table
     labels.  Use simple labels without confirmation for everything
     else.

     The available label types are: `s' (section), `f' (figure), `t'
     (table), `i' (item), `e' (equation), `n' (footnote), `N' (endnote)
     plus any definitions in `reftex-label-alist'.

 - Hook: reftex-format-label-function
     If non-`nil', should be a function which produces the string to
     insert as a label definition.  The function will be called with two
     arguments, the LABEL and the DEFAULT-FORMAT (usually
     `\label{%s}').  It should return the string to insert into the
     buffer.

 - Hook: reftex-string-to-label-function
     Function to turn an arbitrary string into a legal label.  RefTeX's
     default function uses the variable
     `reftex-derive-label-parameters'.

 - Hook: reftex-translate-to-ascii-function
     Filter function which will process a context string before it is
     used to derive a label from it.  The intended application is to
     convert ISO or Mule characters into something legal in labels.
     The default function `reftex-latin1-to-ascii' removes the accents
     from Latin-1 characters.  X-Symbol (>=2.6) sets this variable to
     the much more general `x-symbol-translate-to-ascii'.

 - User Option: reftex-derive-label-parameters
     Parameters for converting a string into a label.  This variable is
     a list of the following items:
    NWORDS
          Number of words to use.

    MAXCHAR
          Maximum number of characters in a label string.

    ILLEGAL
          `nil': Throw away any words containing characters illegal in
          labels.
          `t':   Throw away only the illegal characters, not the whole
          word.

    ABBREV
          `nil': Never abbreviate words.
          `t':   Always abbreviate words (see
          `reftex-abbrev-parameters').
          `1':   Abbreviate words if necessary to shorten label string.

    SEPARATOR
          String separating different words in the label.

    IGNOREWORDS
          List of words which should not be part of labels.

    DOWNCASE
          `t':   Downcase words before putting them into the label.

 - User Option: reftex-label-illegal-re
     Regexp matching characters not legal in labels.

 - User Option: reftex-abbrev-parameters
     Parameters for abbreviation of words.  A list of four parameters.
    MIN-CHARS
          Minimum number of characters remaining after abbreviation.

    MIN-KILL
          Minimum number of characters to remove when abbreviating
          words.

    BEFORE
          Character class before abbrev point in word.

    AFTER
          Character class after  abbrev point in word.

Referencing Labels
==================

 - User Option: reftex-label-menu-flags
     List of flags governing the label menu makeup. The flags are:
    TABLE-OF-CONTENTS
          Show the labels embedded in a table of context.

    SECTION-NUMBERS
          Include section numbers (like 4.1.3) in table of contents.

    COUNTERS
          Show counters.  This just numbers the labels in the menu.

    NO-CONTEXT
          Non-`nil' means do _not_ show the short context.

    FOLLOW
          Follow full context in other window.

    SHOW-COMMENTED
          Show labels from regions which are commented out.

    MATCH-EVERYWHERE
          Obsolete flag.

    SHOW-FILES
          Show begin and end of included files.

     Each of these flags can be set to `t' or `nil', or to a string of
     type letters indicating the label types for which it should be
     true.  These strings work like character classes in regular
     expressions.  Thus, setting one of the flags to `"sf"' makes the
     flag true for section and figure labels, `nil' for everything
     else.  Setting it to `"^sf"' makes it the other way round.

     The available label types are: `s' (section), `f' (figure), `t'
     (table), `i' (item), `e' (equation), `n' (footnote), plus any
     definitions in `reftex-label-alist'.

     Most options can also be switched from the label menu itself - so
     if you decide here to not have a table of contents in the label
     menu, you can still get one interactively during selection from
     the label menu.

 - User Option: reftex-multiref-punctuation
     Punctuation strings for multiple references.  When marking is used
     in the selection buffer to select several references, this variable
     associates the 3 marking characters `,-+' with prefix strings to be
     inserted into the buffer before the corresponding `\ref' macro.
     This is used to string together whole reference sets, like `eqs.
     1,2,3-5,6 and 7' in a single call to `reftex-reference'.

 - User Option: reftex-vref-is-default
     Non-`nil' means, the varioref macro `\vref' is used as default.
     In the selection buffer, the `v' key toggles the reference macro
     between `\ref' and `\vref'.  The value of this variable determines
     the default which is active when entering the selection process.
     Instead of `nil' or `t', this may also be a string of type letters
     indicating the label types for which it should be true.

 - User Option: reftex-fref-is-default
     Non-`nil' means, the fancyref macro `\fref' is used as default.
     In the selection buffer, the `V' key toggles the reference macro
     between `\ref', `\fref' and `\Fref'.  The value of this variable
     determines the default which is active when entering the selection
     process.  Instead of `nil' or `t', this may also be a string of
     type letters indicating the label types for which it should be
     true.

 - Hook: reftex-format-ref-function
     If non-`nil', should be a function which produces the string to
     insert as a reference.  Note that the insertion format can also be
     changed with `reftex-label-alist'.  This hook also is used by the
     special commands to insert `\vref' and `\fref' references, so even
     if you set this, your setting will be ignored by the special
     commands.  The function will be called with two arguments, the
     LABEL and the DEFAULT-FORMAT (usually `~\ref{%s}').  It should
     return the string to insert into the buffer.

 - User Option: reftex-level-indent
     Number of spaces to be used for indentation per section level.

 - User Option: reftex-guess-label-type
     Non-`nil' means, `reftex-reference' will try to guess the label
     type.  To do that, RefTeX will look at the word before the cursor
     and compare it with the magic words given in `reftex-label-alist'.
     When it finds a match, RefTeX will immediately offer the correct
     label menu - otherwise it will prompt you for a label type.  If
     you set this variable to `nil', RefTeX will always prompt for a
     label type.

 - Normal Hook: reftex-display-copied-context-hook
     Normal Hook which is run before context is displayed anywhere.
     Designed for `X-Symbol', but may have other uses as well.

 - Hook: reftex-pre-refontification-functions
     `X-Symbol' specific hook.  Probably not useful for other purposes.
     The functions get two arguments, the buffer from where the command
     started and a symbol indicating in what context the hook is called.

 - Normal Hook: reftex-select-label-mode-hook
     Normal hook which is run when a selection buffer enters
     `reftex-select-label-mode'.

 - Keymap: reftex-select-label-map
     The keymap which is active in the labels selection process (*note
     Referencing Labels::).
