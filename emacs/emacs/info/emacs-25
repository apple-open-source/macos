Changing an Option
..................

   Here is an example of what a user option looks like in the
customization buffer:

     Kill Ring Max: [Hide] 60
        [State]: this option is unchanged from its standard setting.
     Maximum length of kill ring before oldest elements are thrown away.

   The text following `[Hide]', `60' in this case, indicates the
current value of the option.  If you see `[Show]' instead of `[Hide]',
it means that the value is hidden; the customization buffer initially
hides values that take up several lines.  Invoke `[Show]' to show the
value.

   The line after the option name indicates the "customization state"
of the option: in the example above, it says you have not changed the
option yet.  The word `[State]' at the beginning of this line is
active; you can get a menu of various operations by invoking it with
`Mouse-1' or <RET>.  These operations are essential for customizing the
variable.

   The line after the `[State]' line displays the beginning of the
option's documentation string.  If there are more lines of
documentation, this line ends with `[More]'; invoke this to show the
full documentation string.

   To enter a new value for `Kill Ring Max', move point to the value
and edit it textually.  For example, you can type `M-d', then insert
another number.

   When you begin to alter the text, you will see the `[State]' line
change to say that you have edited the value:

     [State]: you have edited the value as text, but not set the option.

   Editing the value does not actually set the option variable.  To do
that, you must "set" the option.  To do this, invoke the word `[State]'
and choose `Set for Current Session'.

   The state of the option changes visibly when you set it:

     [State]: you have set this option, but not saved it for future sessions.

   You don't have to worry about specifying a value that is not valid;
setting the option checks for validity and will not really install an
unacceptable value.

   While editing a value or field that is a file name, directory name,
command name, or anything else for which completion is defined, you can
type `M-<TAB>' (`widget-complete') to do completion.

   Some options have a small fixed set of possible legitimate values.
These options don't let you edit the value textually.  Instead, an
active field `[Value Menu]' appears before the value; invoke this field
to edit the value.  For a boolean "on or off" value, the active field
says `[Toggle]', and it changes to the other value.  `[Value Menu]' and
`[Toggle]' edit the buffer; the changes take effect when you use the
`Set for Current Session' operation.

   Some options have values with complex structure.  For example, the
value of `file-coding-system-alist' is an association list.  Here is
how it appears in the customization buffer:

     File Coding System Alist: [Hide]
     [INS] [DEL] File regexp: \.elc\'
                 Choice: [Value Menu] Encoding/decoding pair:
                 Decoding: emacs-mule
                 Encoding: emacs-mule
     [INS] [DEL] File regexp: \(\`\|/\)loaddefs.el\'
                 Choice: [Value Menu] Encoding/decoding pair:
                 Decoding: raw-text
                 Encoding: raw-text-unix
     [INS] [DEL] File regexp: \.tar\'
                 Choice: [Value Menu] Encoding/decoding pair:
                 Decoding: no-conversion
                 Encoding: no-conversion
     [INS] [DEL] File regexp:
                 Choice: [Value Menu] Encoding/decoding pair:
                 Decoding: undecided
                 Encoding: nil
     [INS]
        [State]: this option is unchanged from its standard setting.
     Alist to decide a coding system to use for a file I/O operation. [Hide]
     The format is ((PATTERN . VAL) ...),
     where PATTERN is a regular expression matching a file name,
     [...more lines of documentation...]

Each association in the list appears on four lines, with several
editable or "active" fields.  You can edit the regexps and coding
systems using ordinary editing commands.  You can also invoke `[Value
Menu]' to switch to a kind of value--for instance, to specify a
function instead of a pair of coding systems.

   To delete an association from the list, invoke the `[DEL]' button
for that item.  To add an association, invoke `[INS]' at the position
where you want to add it.  There is an `[INS]' button between each pair
of association, another at the beginning and another at the end, so you
can add the new association at any position in the list.

   Two special commands, <TAB> and `S-<TAB>', are useful for moving
through the customization buffer.  <TAB> (`widget-forward') moves
forward to the next active or editable field; `S-<TAB>'
(`widget-backward') moves backward to the previous active or editable
field.

   Typing <RET> on an editable field also moves forward, just like
<TAB>.  We set it up this way because people often type <RET> when they
are finished editing a field.  To insert a newline within an editable
field, use `C-o' or `C-q C-j'.

   Setting the option changes its value in the current Emacs session;
"saving" the value changes it for future sessions as well.  This works
by writing code into your `~/.emacs' file so as to set the option
variable again each time you start Emacs.  To save the option, invoke
`[State]' and select the `Save for Future Sessions' operation.

   If Emacs was invoked with the `-q' or `--no-init-file' options
(*note Initial Options::), it will not let you save your customizations
in your `~/.emacs' init file.  This is because saving customizations
from such a session would wipe out all the other customizations you
might have on your init file.

   You can also restore the option to its standard value by invoking
`[State]' and selecting the `Erase Customization' operation.  There are
actually three reset operations:

`Reset'
     If you have made some modifications and not yet set the option,
     this restores the text in the customization buffer to match the
     actual value.

`Reset to Saved'
     This restores the value of the option to the last saved value, and
     updates the text accordingly.

`Erase Customization'
     This sets the option to its standard value, and updates the text
     accordingly.  This also eliminates any saved value for the option,
     so that you will get the standard value in future Emacs sessions.

   Sometimes it is useful to record a comment about a specific
customization.  Use the `Add Comment' item from the `[State]' menu to
create a field for entering the comment.  The comment you enter will be
saved, and displayed again if you again view the same option in a
customization buffer, even in another session.

   The state of a group indicates whether anything in that group has
been edited, set or saved.  You can select `Set for Current Session',
`Save for Future Sessions' and the various kinds of `Reset' operation
for the group; these operations on the group apply to all options in
the group and its subgroups.

   Near the top of the customization buffer there are two lines
containing several active fields:

      [Set for Current Session] [Save for Future Sessions]
      [Reset] [Reset to Saved] [Erase Customization]   [Finish]

Invoking `[Finish]' either buries or kills this customization buffer
according to the setting of the option `custom-buffer-done-function';
the default is to bury the buffer.  Each of the other fields performs
an operation--set, save or reset--on each of the items in the buffer
that could meaningfully be set, saved or reset.

Customizing Faces
.................

   In addition to user options, some customization groups also include
faces.  When you show the contents of a group, both the user options and
the faces in the group appear in the customization buffer.  Here is an
example of how a face looks:

     Custom Changed Face: (sample) [Hide]
        [State]: this face is unchanged from its standard setting.
     Parent groups: [Custom Magic Faces]
     Attributes: [ ] Font family: [Value Menu] *
                 [ ] Width: [Value Menu] *
                 [ ] Height: [Value Menu] *
                 [ ] Weight: [Value Menu] *
                 [ ] Slant: [Value Menu] *
                 [ ] Underline: [Value Menu] *
                 [ ] Overline: [Value Menu] *
                 [ ] Strike-through: [Value Menu] *
                 [ ] Box around text: [Value Menu] *
                 [ ] Inverse-video: [Value Menu] *
                 [X] Foreground: [Value Menu] Color: white       (sample)
                 [X] Background: [Value Menu] Color: blue        (sample)
                 [ ] Stipple: [Value Menu] *
                 [ ] Inherit:

   Each face attribute has its own line.  The `[X]' field before the
attribute name indicates whether the attribute is "enabled"; `X' means
that it is.  You can enable or disable the attribute by invoking that
field.  When the attribute is enabled, you can change the attribute
value in the usual ways.

   On a black-and-white display, the colors you can use for the
background are `black', `white', `gray', `gray1', and `gray3'.  Emacs
supports these shades of gray by using background stipple patterns
instead of a color.

   Setting, saving and resetting a face work like the same operations
for options (*note Changing an Option::).

   A face can specify different appearances for different types of
display.  For example, a face can make text red on a color display, but
use a bold font on a monochrome display.  To specify multiple
appearances for a face, select `Show all display specs' in the menu you
get from invoking `[State]'.

   Another more basic way to set the attributes of a specific face is
with `M-x modify-face'.  This command reads the name of a face, then
reads the attributes one by one.  For the color and stipple attributes,
the attribute's current value is the default--type just <RET> if you
don't want to change that attribute.  Type `none' if you want to clear
out the attribute.


File: emacs,  Node: Specific Customization,  Prev: Face Customization,  Up: Easy Customization

Customizing Specific Items
..........................

   Instead of finding the options you want to change by moving down
through the structure of groups, you can specify the particular option,
face or group that you want to customize.

`M-x customize-option <RET> OPTION <RET>'
     Set up a customization buffer with just one option, OPTION.

`M-x customize-face <RET> FACE <RET>'
     Set up a customization buffer with just one face, FACE.

`M-x customize-group <RET> GROUP <RET>'
     Set up a customization buffer with just one group, GROUP.

`M-x customize-apropos <RET> REGEXP <RET>'
     Set up a customization buffer with all the options, faces and
     groups that match REGEXP.

`M-x customize-changed-options <RET> VERSION <RET>'
     Set up a customization buffer with all the options, faces and
     groups whose meaning has changed since Emacs version VERSION.

`M-x customize-saved'
     Set up a customization buffer containing all options and faces
     that you have saved with customization buffers.

`M-x customize-customized'
     Set up a customization buffer containing all options and faces
     that you have customized but not saved.

   If you want to alter a particular user option variable with the
customization buffer, and you know its name, you can use the command
`M-x customize-option' and specify the option name.  This sets up the
customization buffer with just one option--the one that you asked for.
Editing, setting and saving the value work as described above, but only
for the specified option.

   Likewise, you can modify a specific face, chosen by name, using `M-x
customize-face'.

   You can also set up the customization buffer with a specific group,
using `M-x customize-group'.  The immediate contents of the chosen
group, including option variables, faces, and other groups, all appear
as well.  However, these subgroups' own contents start out hidden.  You
can show their contents in the usual way, by invoking `[Show]'.

   To control more precisely what to customize, you can use `M-x
customize-apropos'.  You specify a regular expression as argument; then
all options, faces and groups whose names match this regular expression
are set up in the customization buffer.  If you specify an empty regular
expression, this includes _all_ groups, options and faces in the
customization buffer (but that takes a long time).

   When you upgrade to a new Emacs version, you might want to customize
new options and options whose meanings or default values have changed.
To do this, use `M-x customize-changed-options' and specify a previous
Emacs version number using the minibuffer.  It creates a customization
buffer which shows all the options (and groups) whose definitions have
been changed since the specified version.

   If you change option values and then decide the change was a mistake,
you can use two special commands to revisit your previous changes.  Use
`M-x customize-saved' to look at the options and faces that you have
saved.  Use `M-x customize-customized' to look at the options and faces
that you have set but not saved.


File: emacs,  Node: Hooks,  Next: Locals,  Prev: Easy Customization,  Up: Variables

Hooks
-----

   "Hooks" are an important mechanism for customization of Emacs.  A
hook is a Lisp variable which holds a list of functions, to be called on
some well-defined occasion.  (This is called "running the hook".)  The
individual functions in the list are called the "hook functions" of the
hook.  With rare exceptions, hooks in Emacs are empty when Emacs starts
up, so the only hook functions in any given hook are the ones you
explicitly put there as customization.

   Most major modes run one or more "mode hooks" as the last step of
initialization.  This makes it easy for you to customize the behavior of
the mode, by setting up a hook function to override the local variable
assignments already made by the mode.  But hooks are also used in other
contexts.  For example, the hook `suspend-hook' runs just before Emacs
suspends itself (*note Exiting::).

   Most Emacs hooks are "normal hooks".  This means that running the
hook operates by calling all the hook functions, unconditionally, with
no arguments.  We have made an effort to keep most hooks normal so that
you can use them in a uniform way.  Every variable in Emacs whose name
ends in `-hook' is a normal hook.

   There are also a few "abnormal hooks".  These variables' names end
in `-hooks' or `-functions', instead of `-hook'.  What makes these
hooks abnormal is that there is something peculiar about the way its
functions are called--perhaps they are given arguments, or perhaps the
values they return are used in some way.  For example,
`find-file-not-found-hooks' (*note Visiting::) is abnormal because as
soon as one hook function returns a non-`nil' value, the rest are not
called at all.  The documentation of each abnormal hook variable
explains in detail what is peculiar about it.

   The recommended way to add a hook function to a hook (either normal
or abnormal) is by calling `add-hook'.  You can use any valid Lisp
function as the hook function, provided it can handle the proper number
of arguments (zero arguments, in the case of a normal hook).  Of course,
not every Lisp function is _useful_ in any particular hook.

   For example, here's how to set up a hook to turn on Auto Fill mode
when entering Text mode and other modes based on Text mode:

     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)

   The next example shows how to use a hook to customize the indentation
of C code.  (People often have strong personal preferences for one
format compared to another.)  Here the hook function is an anonymous
lambda expression.

     (setq my-c-style
       '((c-comment-only-line-offset . 4)
         (c-cleanup-list . (scope-operator
     		       empty-defun-braces
     		       defun-close-semi))
         (c-offsets-alist . ((arglist-close . c-lineup-arglist)
     			(substatement-open . 0)))))
     
     (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
       '(lambda ()
          (c-add-style "my-style" my-c-style t)))

   It is best to design your hook functions so that the order in which
they are executed does not matter.  Any dependence on the order is
"asking for trouble."  However, the order is predictable: the most
recently added hook functions are executed first.


File: emacs,  Node: Locals,  Next: File Variables,  Prev: Hooks,  Up: Variables

Local Variables
---------------

`M-x make-local-variable <RET> VAR <RET>'
     Make variable VAR have a local value in the current buffer.

`M-x kill-local-variable <RET> VAR <RET>'
     Make variable VAR use its global value in the current buffer.

`M-x make-variable-buffer-local <RET> VAR <RET>'
     Mark variable VAR so that setting it will make it local to the
     buffer that is current at that time.

   Almost any variable can be made "local" to a specific Emacs buffer.
This means that its value in that buffer is independent of its value in
other buffers.  A few variables are always local in every buffer.
Every other Emacs variable has a "global" value which is in effect in
all buffers that have not made the variable local.

   `M-x make-local-variable' reads the name of a variable and makes it
local to the current buffer.  Further changes in this buffer will not
affect others, and further changes in the global value will not affect
this buffer.

   `M-x make-variable-buffer-local' reads the name of a variable and
changes the future behavior of the variable so that it will become local
automatically when it is set.  More precisely, once a variable has been
marked in this way, the usual ways of setting the variable automatically
do `make-local-variable' first.  We call such variables "per-buffer"
variables.

   Major modes (*note Major Modes::) always make variables local to the
buffer before setting the variables.  This is why changing major modes
in one buffer has no effect on other buffers.  Minor modes also work by
setting variables--normally, each minor mode has one controlling
variable which is non-`nil' when the mode is enabled (*note Minor
Modes::).  For most minor modes, the controlling variable is per buffer.

   Emacs contains a number of variables that are always per-buffer.
These include `abbrev-mode', `auto-fill-function', `case-fold-search',
`comment-column', `ctl-arrow', `fill-column', `fill-prefix',
`indent-tabs-mode', `left-margin', `mode-line-format', `overwrite-mode',
`selective-display-ellipses', `selective-display', `tab-width', and
`truncate-lines'.  Some other variables are always local in every
buffer, but they are used for internal purposes.

   A few variables cannot be local to a buffer because they are always
local to each display instead (*note Multiple Displays::).  If you try
to make one of these variables buffer-local, you'll get an error
message.

   `M-x kill-local-variable' reads the name of a variable and makes it
cease to be local to the current buffer.  The global value of the
variable henceforth is in effect in this buffer.  Setting the major mode
kills all the local variables of the buffer except for a few variables
specially marked as "permanent locals".

   To set the global value of a variable, regardless of whether the
variable has a local value in the current buffer, you can use the Lisp
construct `setq-default'.  This construct is used just like `setq', but
it sets variables' global values instead of their local values (if
any).  When the current buffer does have a local value, the new global
value may not be visible until you switch to another buffer.  Here is
an example:

     (setq-default fill-column 75)

`setq-default' is the only way to set the global value of a variable
that has been marked with `make-variable-buffer-local'.

   Lisp programs can use `default-value' to look at a variable's
default value.  This function takes a symbol as argument and returns its
default value.  The argument is evaluated; usually you must quote it
explicitly.  For example, here's how to obtain the default value of
`fill-column':

     (default-value 'fill-column)

Local Variables in Files
------------------------

   A file can specify local variable values for use when you edit the
file with Emacs.  Visiting the file checks for local variable
specifications; it automatically makes these variables local to the
buffer, and sets them to the values specified in the file.

   There are two ways to specify local variable values: in the first
line, or with a local variables list.  Here's how to specify them in the
first line:

     -*- mode: MODENAME; VAR: VALUE; ... -*-

You can specify any number of variables/value pairs in this way, each
pair with a colon and semicolon as shown above.  `mode: MODENAME;'
specifies the major mode; this should come first in the line.  The
VALUEs are not evaluated; they are used literally.  Here is an example
that specifies Lisp mode and sets two variables with numeric values:

     ;; -*- mode: Lisp; fill-column: 75; comment-column: 50; -*-

   You can also specify the coding system for a file in this way: just
specify a value for the "variable" named `coding'.  The "value" must be
a coding system name that Emacs recognizes.  *Note Coding Systems::.

   The `eval' pseudo-variable, described below, can be specified in the
first line as well.

   In shell scripts, the first line is used to identify the script
interpreter, so you cannot put any local variables there.  To
accommodate for this, when Emacs visits a shell script, it looks for
local variable specifications in the _second_ line.

   A "local variables list" goes near the end of the file, in the last
page.  (It is often best to put it on a page by itself.)  The local
variables list starts with a line containing the string `Local
Variables:', and ends with a line containing the string `End:'.  In
between come the variable names and values, one set per line, as
`VARIABLE: VALUE'.  The VALUEs are not evaluated; they are used
literally.  If a file has both a local variables list and a `-*-' line,
Emacs processes _everything_ in the `-*-' line first, and _everything_
in the local variables list afterward.

   Here is an example of a local variables list:

     ;;; Local Variables: ***
     ;;; mode:lisp ***
     ;;; comment-column:0 ***
     ;;; comment-start: ";;; "  ***
     ;;; comment-end:"***" ***
     ;;; End: ***

   As you see, each line starts with the prefix `;;; ' and each line
ends with the suffix ` ***'.  Emacs recognizes these as the prefix and
suffix based on the first line of the list, by finding them surrounding
the magic string `Local Variables:'; then it automatically discards
them from the other lines of the list.

   The usual reason for using a prefix and/or suffix is to embed the
local variables list in a comment, so it won't confuse other programs
that the file is intended as input for.  The example above is for a
language where comment lines start with `;;; ' and end with `***'; the
local values for `comment-start' and `comment-end' customize the rest
of Emacs for this unusual syntax.  Don't use a prefix (or a suffix) if
you don't need one.

   Two "variable names" have special meanings in a local variables
list: a value for the variable `mode' really sets the major mode, and a
value for the variable `eval' is simply evaluated as an expression and
the value is ignored.  `mode' and `eval' are not real variables;
setting variables named `mode' and `eval' in any other context has no
special meaning.  _If `mode' is used to set a major mode, it should be
the first "variable" in the list._  Otherwise, the entries that precede
it in the list of the local variables are likely to be ignored, since
most modes kill all local variables as part of their initialization.

   You can use the `mode' "variable" to set minor modes as well as
major modes; in fact, you can use it more than once, first to set the
major mode and then to set minor modes which are specific to particular
buffers.  But most minor modes should not be specified in the file in
any fashion, because they represent user preferences.

   For example, you may be tempted to try to turn on Auto Fill mode with
a local variable list.  That is a mistake.  The choice of Auto Fill mode
or not is a matter of individual taste, not a matter of the contents of
particular files.  If you want to use Auto Fill, set up major mode hooks
with your `.emacs' file to turn it on (when appropriate) for you alone
(*note Init File::).  Don't use a local variable list to impose your
taste on everyone.

   The start of the local variables list must be no more than 3000
characters from the end of the file, and must be in the last page if the
file is divided into pages.  Otherwise, Emacs will not notice it is
there.  The purpose of this rule is so that a stray `Local Variables:'
not in the last page does not confuse Emacs, and so that visiting a
long file that is all one page and has no local variables list need not
take the time to search the whole file.

   Use the command `normal-mode' to reset the local variables and major
mode of a buffer according to the file name and contents, including the
local variables list if any.  *Note Choosing Modes::.

   The variable `enable-local-variables' controls whether to process
local variables in files, and thus gives you a chance to override them.
Its default value is `t', which means do process local variables in
files.  If you set the value to `nil', Emacs simply ignores local
variables in files.  Any other value says to query you about each file
that has local variables, showing you the local variable specifications
so you can judge.

   The `eval' "variable," and certain actual variables, create a
special risk; when you visit someone else's file, local variable
specifications for these could affect your Emacs in arbitrary ways.
Therefore, the option `enable-local-eval' controls whether Emacs
processes `eval' variables, as well variables with names that end in
`-hook', `-hooks', `-function' or `-functions', and certain other
variables.  The three possibilities for the option's value are `t',
`nil', and anything else, just as for `enable-local-variables'.  The
default is `maybe', which is neither `t' nor `nil', so normally Emacs
does ask for confirmation about file settings for these variables.

   A "keyboard macro" is a command defined by the user to stand for
another sequence of keys.  For example, if you discover that you are
about to type `C-n C-d' forty times, you can speed your work by
defining a keyboard macro to do `C-n C-d' and calling it with a repeat
count of forty.

`C-x ('
     Start defining a keyboard macro (`start-kbd-macro').

`C-x )'
     End the definition of a keyboard macro (`end-kbd-macro').

`C-x e'
     Execute the most recent keyboard macro (`call-last-kbd-macro').

`C-u C-x ('
     Re-execute last keyboard macro, then add more keys to its
     definition.

`C-x q'
     When this point is reached during macro execution, ask for
     confirmation (`kbd-macro-query').

`M-x name-last-kbd-macro'
     Give a command name (for the duration of the session) to the most
     recently defined keyboard macro.

`M-x insert-kbd-macro'
     Insert in the buffer a keyboard macro's definition, as Lisp code.

`C-x C-k'
     Edit a previously defined keyboard macro (`edit-kbd-macro').

`M-x apply-macro-to-region-lines'
     Run the last keyboard macro on each complete line in the region.

   Keyboard macros differ from ordinary Emacs commands in that they are
written in the Emacs command language rather than in Lisp.  This makes
it easier for the novice to write them, and makes them more convenient
as temporary hacks.  However, the Emacs command language is not powerful
enough as a programming language to be useful for writing anything
intelligent or general.  For such things, Lisp must be used.

   You define a keyboard macro while executing the commands which are
the definition.  Put differently, as you define a keyboard macro, the
definition is being executed for the first time.  This way, you can see
what the effects of your commands are, so that you don't have to figure
them out in your head.  When you are finished, the keyboard macro is
defined and also has been, in effect, executed once.  You can then do
the whole thing over again by invoking the macro.

Basic Use
---------

   To start defining a keyboard macro, type the `C-x (' command
(`start-kbd-macro').  From then on, your keys continue to be executed,
but also become part of the definition of the macro.  `Def' appears in
the mode line to remind you of what is going on.  When you are
finished, the `C-x )' command (`end-kbd-macro') terminates the
definition (without becoming part of it!).  For example,

     C-x ( M-f foo C-x )

defines a macro to move forward a word and then insert `foo'.

   The macro thus defined can be invoked again with the `C-x e' command
(`call-last-kbd-macro'), which may be given a repeat count as a numeric
argument to execute the macro many times.  `C-x )' can also be given a
repeat count as an argument, in which case it repeats the macro that
many times right after defining it, but defining the macro counts as
the first repetition (since it is executed as you define it).
Therefore, giving `C-x )' an argument of 4 executes the macro
immediately 3 additional times.  An argument of zero to `C-x e' or `C-x
)' means repeat the macro indefinitely (until it gets an error or you
type `C-g' or, on MS-DOS, `C-<BREAK>').

   If you wish to repeat an operation at regularly spaced places in the
text, define a macro and include as part of the macro the commands to
move to the next place you want to use it.  For example, if you want to
change each line, you should position point at the start of a line, and
define a macro to change that line and leave point at the start of the
next line.  Then repeating the macro will operate on successive lines.

   When a command reads an argument with the minibuffer, your
minibuffer input becomes part of the macro along with the command.  So
when you replay the macro, the command gets the same argument as when
you entered the macro.  For example,

     C-x ( C-a C-<SPC> C-n M-w C-x b f o o <RET> C-y C-x b <RET> C-x )

defines a macro that copies the current line into the buffer `foo',
then returns to the original buffer.

   You can use function keys in a keyboard macro, just like keyboard
keys.  You can even use mouse events, but be careful about that: when
the macro replays the mouse event, it uses the original mouse position
of that event, the position that the mouse had while you were defining
the macro.  The effect of this may be hard to predict.  (Using the
current mouse position would be even less predictable.)

   One thing that doesn't always work well in a keyboard macro is the
command `C-M-c' (`exit-recursive-edit').  When this command exits a
recursive edit that started within the macro, it works as you'd expect.
But if it exits a recursive edit that started before you invoked the
keyboard macro, it also necessarily exits the keyboard macro as part of
the process.

   After you have terminated the definition of a keyboard macro, you
can add to the end of its definition by typing `C-u C-x ('.  This is
equivalent to plain `C-x (' followed by retyping the whole definition
so far.  As a consequence it re-executes the macro as previously
defined.

   You can edit a keyboard macro already defined by typing `C-x C-k'
(`edit-kbd-macro').  Follow that with the keyboard input that you would
use to invoke the macro--`C-x e' or `M-x NAME' or some other key
sequence.  This formats the macro definition in a buffer and enters a
specialized major mode for editing it.  Type `C-h m' once in that
buffer to display details of how to edit the macro.  When you are
finished editing, type `C-c C-c'.

   The command `M-x apply-macro-to-region-lines' repeats the last
defined keyboard macro on each complete line within the current region.
It does this line by line, by moving point to the beginning of the line
and then executing the macro.

Naming and Saving Keyboard Macros
---------------------------------

   If you wish to save a keyboard macro for longer than until you
define the next one, you must give it a name using `M-x
name-last-kbd-macro'.  This reads a name as an argument using the
minibuffer and defines that name to execute the macro.  The macro name
is a Lisp symbol, and defining it in this way makes it a valid command
name for calling with `M-x' or for binding a key to with
`global-set-key' (*note Keymaps::).  If you specify a name that has a
prior definition other than another keyboard macro, an error message is
shown and nothing is changed.

   Once a macro has a command name, you can save its definition in a
file.  Then it can be used in another editing session.  First, visit
the file you want to save the definition in.  Then use this command:

     M-x insert-kbd-macro <RET> MACRONAME <RET>

This inserts some Lisp code that, when executed later, will define the
same macro with the same definition it has now.  (You need not
understand Lisp code to do this, because `insert-kbd-macro' writes the
Lisp code for you.)  Then save the file.  You can load the file later
with `load-file' (*note Lisp Libraries::).  If the file you save in is
your init file `~/.emacs' (*note Init File::) then the macro will be
defined each time you run Emacs.

   If you give `insert-kbd-macro' a numeric argument, it makes
additional Lisp code to record the keys (if any) that you have bound to
the keyboard macro, so that the macro will be reassigned the same keys
when you load the file.

Executing Macros with Variations
--------------------------------

   Using `C-x q' (`kbd-macro-query'), you can get an effect similar to
that of `query-replace', where the macro asks you each time around
whether to make a change.  While defining the macro, type `C-x q' at
the point where you want the query to occur.  During macro definition,
the `C-x q' does nothing, but when you run the macro later, `C-x q'
asks you interactively whether to continue.

   The valid responses when `C-x q' asks are <SPC> (or `y'), <DEL> (or
`n'), <RET> (or `q'), `C-l' and `C-r'.  The answers are the same as in
`query-replace', though not all of the `query-replace' options are
meaningful.

   These responses include <SPC> to continue, and <DEL> to skip the
remainder of this repetition of the macro and start right away with the
next repetition.  <RET> means to skip the remainder of this repetition
and cancel further repetitions.  `C-l' redraws the screen and asks you
again for a character to say what to do.

   `C-r' enters a recursive editing level, in which you can perform
editing which is not part of the macro.  When you exit the recursive
edit using `C-M-c', you are asked again how to continue with the
keyboard macro.  If you type a <SPC> at this time, the rest of the
macro definition is executed.  It is up to you to leave point and the
text in a state such that the rest of the macro will do what you want.

   `C-u C-x q', which is `C-x q' with a numeric argument, performs a
completely different function.  It enters a recursive edit reading
input from the keyboard, both when you type it during the definition of
the macro, and when it is executed from the macro.  During definition,
the editing you do inside the recursive edit does not become part of
the macro.  During macro execution, the recursive edit gives you a
chance to do some particularized editing on each repetition.  *Note
Recursive Edit::.

   Another way to vary the behavior of a keyboard macro is to use a
register as a counter, incrementing it on each repetition of the macro.
*Note RegNumbers::.

Customizing Key Bindings
========================

   This section describes "key bindings", which map keys to commands,
and "keymaps", which record key bindings.  It also explains how to
customize key bindings.

   Recall that a command is a Lisp function whose definition provides
for interactive use.  Like every Lisp function, a command has a function
name which usually consists of lower-case letters and hyphens.

Keymaps
-------

   The bindings between key sequences and command functions are recorded
in data structures called "keymaps".  Emacs has many of these, each
used on particular occasions.

   Recall that a "key sequence" ("key", for short) is a sequence of
"input events" that have a meaning as a unit.  Input events include
characters, function keys and mouse buttons--all the inputs that you
can send to the computer with your terminal.  A key sequence gets its
meaning from its "binding", which says what command it runs.  The
function of keymaps is to record these bindings.

   The "global" keymap is the most important keymap because it is
always in effect.  The global keymap defines keys for Fundamental mode;
most of these definitions are common to most or all major modes.  Each
major or minor mode can have its own keymap which overrides the global
definitions of some keys.

   For example, a self-inserting character such as `g' is
self-inserting because the global keymap binds it to the command
`self-insert-command'.  The standard Emacs editing characters such as
`C-a' also get their standard meanings from the global keymap.
Commands to rebind keys, such as `M-x global-set-key', actually work by
storing the new binding in the proper place in the global map.  *Note
Rebinding::.

   Meta characters work differently; Emacs translates each Meta
character into a pair of characters starting with <ESC>.  When you type
the character `M-a' in a key sequence, Emacs replaces it with `<ESC>
a'.  A meta key comes in as a single input event, but becomes two
events for purposes of key bindings.  The reason for this is
historical, and we might change it someday.

   Most modern keyboards have function keys as well as character keys.
Function keys send input events just as character keys do, and keymaps
can have bindings for them.

   On many terminals, typing a function key actually sends the computer
a sequence of characters; the precise details of the sequence depends on
which function key and on the model of terminal you are using.  (Often
the sequence starts with `<ESC> ['.)  If Emacs understands your
terminal type properly, it recognizes the character sequences forming
function keys wherever they occur in a key sequence (not just at the
beginning).  Thus, for most purposes, you can pretend the function keys
reach Emacs directly and ignore their encoding as character sequences.

   Mouse buttons also produce input events.  These events come with
other data--the window and position where you pressed or released the
button, and a time stamp.  But only the choice of button matters for key
bindings; the other data matters only if a command looks at it.
(Commands designed for mouse invocation usually do look at the other
data.)

   A keymap records definitions for single events.  Interpreting a key
sequence of multiple events involves a chain of keymaps.  The first
keymap gives a definition for the first event; this definition is
another keymap, which is used to look up the second event in the
sequence, and so on.

   Key sequences can mix function keys and characters.  For example,
`C-x <SELECT>' is meaningful.  If you make <SELECT> a prefix key, then
`<SELECT> C-n' makes sense.  You can even mix mouse events with
keyboard events, but we recommend against it, because such key
sequences are inconvenient to use.

   As a user, you can redefine any key; but it is usually best to stick
to key sequences that consist of `C-c' followed by a letter.  These
keys are "reserved for users," so they won't conflict with any properly
designed Emacs extension.  The function keys <F5> through <F9> are also
reserved for users.  If you redefine some other key, your definition
may be overridden by certain extensions or major modes which redefine
the same key.

Prefix Keymaps
--------------

   A prefix key such as `C-x' or <ESC> has its own keymap, which holds
the definition for the event that immediately follows that prefix.

   The definition of a prefix key is usually the keymap to use for
looking up the following event.  The definition can also be a Lisp
symbol whose function definition is the following keymap; the effect is
the same, but it provides a command name for the prefix key that can be
used as a description of what the prefix key is for.  Thus, the binding
of `C-x' is the symbol `Ctl-X-Prefix', whose function definition is the
keymap for `C-x' commands.  The definitions of `C-c', `C-x', `C-h' and
<ESC> as prefix keys appear in the global map, so these prefix keys are
always available.

   Aside from ordinary prefix keys, there is a fictitious "prefix key"
which represents the menu bar; see *Note Menu Bar: (elisp)Menu Bar, for
special information about menu bar key bindings.  Mouse button events
that invoke pop-up menus are also prefix keys; see *Note Menu Keymaps:
(elisp)Menu Keymaps, for more details.

   Some prefix keymaps are stored in variables with names:

   * `ctl-x-map' is the variable name for the map used for characters
     that follow `C-x'.

   * `help-map' is for characters that follow `C-h'.

   * `esc-map' is for characters that follow <ESC>.  Thus, all Meta
     characters are actually defined by this map.

   * `ctl-x-4-map' is for characters that follow `C-x 4'.

   * `mode-specific-map' is for characters that follow `C-c'.


File: emacs,  Node: Local Keymaps,  Next: Minibuffer Maps,  Prev: Prefix Keymaps,  Up: Key Bindings

Local Keymaps
-------------

   So far we have explained the ins and outs of the global map.  Major
modes customize Emacs by providing their own key bindings in "local
keymaps".  For example, C mode overrides <TAB> to make it indent the
current line for C code.  Portions of text in the buffer can specify
their own keymaps to substitute for the keymap of the buffer's major
mode.

   Minor modes can also have local keymaps.  Whenever a minor mode is
in effect, the definitions in its keymap override both the major mode's
local keymap and the global keymap.

   The local keymaps for Lisp mode and several other major modes always
exist even when not in use.  These are kept in variables named
`lisp-mode-map' and so on.  For major modes less often used, the local
keymap is normally constructed only when the mode is used for the first
time in a session.  This is to save space.  If you wish to change one
of these keymaps, you must use the major mode's "mode hook"--see below.

   All minor mode keymaps are created in advance.  There is no way to
defer their creation until the first time the minor mode is enabled.

   A local keymap can locally redefine a key as a prefix key by defining
it as a prefix keymap.  If the key is also defined globally as a prefix,
then its local and global definitions (both keymaps) effectively
combine: both of them are used to look up the event that follows the
prefix key.  Thus, if the mode's local keymap defines `C-c' as another
keymap, and that keymap defines `C-z' as a command, this provides a
local meaning for `C-c C-z'.  This does not affect other sequences that
start with `C-c'; if those sequences don't have their own local
bindings, their global bindings remain in effect.

   Another way to think of this is that Emacs handles a multi-event key
sequence by looking in several keymaps, one by one, for a binding of the
whole key sequence.  First it checks the minor mode keymaps for minor
modes that are enabled, then it checks the major mode's keymap, and then
it checks the global keymap.  This is not precisely how key lookup
works, but it's good enough for understanding ordinary circumstances.

   To change the local bindings of a major mode, you must change the
mode's local keymap.  Normally you must wait until the first time the
mode is used, because most major modes don't create their keymaps until
then.  If you want to specify something in your `~/.emacs' file to
change a major mode's bindings, you must use the mode's mode hook to
delay the change until the mode is first used.

   For example, the command `texinfo-mode' to select Texinfo mode runs
the hook `texinfo-mode-hook'.  Here's how you can use the hook to add
local bindings (not very useful, we admit) for `C-c n' and `C-c p' in
Texinfo mode:

     (add-hook 'texinfo-mode-hook
               '(lambda ()
                  (define-key texinfo-mode-map "\C-cp"
                              'backward-paragraph)
                  (define-key texinfo-mode-map "\C-cn"
                              'forward-paragraph)))

   *Note Hooks::.

Minibuffer Keymaps
------------------

   The minibuffer has its own set of local keymaps; they contain various
completion and exit commands.

   * `minibuffer-local-map' is used for ordinary input (no completion).

   * `minibuffer-local-ns-map' is similar, except that <SPC> exits just
     like <RET>.  This is used mainly for Mocklisp compatibility.

   * `minibuffer-local-completion-map' is for permissive completion.

   * `minibuffer-local-must-match-map' is for strict completion and for
     cautious completion.
