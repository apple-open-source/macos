Overview
********

   EUDC, the "Emacs Unified Directory Client", provides a common user
interface to access directory servers using different directory
protocols.

   Currently supported back-ends are:

   * LDAP, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

   * CCSO PH/QI

   * BBDB, Big Brother's Insiduous Database

   The main features of the EUDC interface are:

   * Queries using a customizable form

   * Inline query expansion (for instance you can expand a name to an
     email address in a mail message buffer using a server as an
     address book)

   * Multiple servers can be tried in turn until a match is found for an
     inline query

   * Fast minibuffer queries for email addresses and phone numbers

   * Interface to BBDB to let you insert server records into your own
     BBDB database (*note BBDB: (bbdb)Top.)

LDAP
====

   LDAP, "the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol", is a communication
protocol for directory applications defined in RFC 1777.

   Quoted from RFC 1777:

     [LDAP] is designed to provide access to the X.500 Directory while
     not incurring the resource requirements of the Directory Access
     Protocol (DAP). This protocol is specifically targeted at simple
     management applications and browser applications that provide
     simple read/write interactive access to the X.500 Directory, and
     is intended to be a complement to the DAP itself.

   LDAP servers usually store (but are not limited to) information about
people such as their name, phone number, email address, office
location, etc.... More information about LDAP can be found at
<http://www.openldap.org/>

   EUDC requires external support to access LDAP directory servers
(*note LDAP Requirements::)


File: eudc,  Node: CCSO PH/QI,  Next: BBDB,  Prev: LDAP,  Up: Overview

CCSO PH/QI
==========

   The Central Computing Services Office (CCSO) of the University of
Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC) created and freely distributes a
directory system that is currently in use in more than 300 organizations
around the world.  The system records information about people such as
their address, phone number, email, academic information or any other
details it was configured to.

   The system consists of two parts: a database server traditionally
called `qi' and a command-line client called `ph'.
<ftp://uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu/pub/packages/ph> is the main distribution
site.  <http://www.uiuc.edu/cgi-bin/ph/lookup?Query=.> provides a
listing of the active `qi' servers.

   The original command-line `ph' client that comes with the `ph/qi'
distribution provides additional features like the possibility to
communicate with the server in login-mode which makes it possible to
change records in the database.  This is not implemented in EUDC.


File: eudc,  Node: BBDB,  Prev: CCSO PH/QI,  Up: Overview

BBDB
====

   BBDB is the "Big Brother's Insiduous Database", a package for Emacs
originally written by Jamie Zawinski which provides rolodex-like
database functionality featuring tight integration with the Emacs mail
and news readers.

   It is often used as an enhanced email address book.

   EUDC considers BBDB as a directory server back end just like LDAP or
PH/QI servers, though BBDB has no client/server protocol and thus always
resides locally on your machine.  The point in this is not to offer an
alternate way to query your BBDB database (BBDB itself provides much
more flexible ways to do that), but rather to offer an interface to your
local directory that is consistent with the interface to external
directories (LDAP, PH/QI).  This is particularly interesting when
performing queries on multiple servers.

   EUDC also offers a means to insert results from directory queries
into your own local BBDB (*note Creating BBDB Records::)


File: eudc,  Node: Installation,  Next: Usage,  Prev: Overview,  Up: Top

Installation
************

   Add the following to your `.emacs' init file:
     (require 'eudc)
   This will install EUDC at startup.

   After installing EUDC you will find (the next time you launch Emacs)
a new `Directory Search' submenu in the `Tools' menu that will give you
access to EUDC.

   You may also find it useful to add the following to your `.emacs'
initialization file to add a shortcut for email address expansion in
email composition buffers (*note Inline Query Expansion::)

     (eval-after-load
      "message"
      '(define-key message-mode-map [(control ?c) (tab)] 'eudc-expand-inline))
     (eval-after-load
      "sendmail"
      '(define-key mail-mode-map [(control ?c) (tab)] 'eudc-expand-inline))

LDAP Requirements
=================

   LDAP support is added by means of `ldap.el' which is part of Emacs.
`ldap.el' needs an external command line utility named `ldapsearch'
which is available as part of LDAP toolkits:

   * Open LDAP Libraries (<http://www.openldap.org/>)

   * University of Michigan's LDAP Client software
     (<http://www.umich.edu/~dirsvcs/ldap/>)

Querying Servers
================

   EUDC's basic functionality is to let you query a directory server and
return the results back to you.  There are several things you may want
to customize in this process.

* Menu:

* Selecting a Server::          The first thing to do
* Return Attributes::           Configuring what the server should return
* Duplicate Attributes::        What to do when records have duplicate attributes


File: eudc,  Node: Selecting a Server,  Next: Return Attributes,  Prev: Querying Servers,  Up: Querying Servers

Selecting a Server
------------------

   Before doing any query you will need to set the directory server.
You need to specify the name of the host machine running the server
software and the protocol to use. If you do not set the server in any
fashion, EUDC will ask you for one when you make your first query.

   You can set the server by selecting one from your hotlist of servers
(*note The Server Hotlist::) available in the `Server' submenu or by
selecting `New Server' in that same menu.

   LDAP servers generally require some configuration before you can
perform queries on them.  In particular, the "search base" must be
configured.  If the server you select has no configured search base then
EUDC will propose you to configure it at this point.  A customization
buffer will be displayed where you can edit the search base and other
parameters for the server.

 - Variable: eudc-server
     The name or IP address of the remote directory server. A TCP port
     number may be specified by appending a colon and a number to the
     name of the server. You will not need this unless your server runs
     on a port other than the default (which depends on the protocol).
     If the directory server resides on your own computer (which is the
     case if you use the BBDB back end) then `localhost' is a
     reasonable value but it will be ignored anyway.

 - Variable: eudc-protocol
     The directory protocol to use to query the server.  Currently
     supported protocols in this version of EUDC are `ph', `ldap' and
     `bbdb'.

 - Command: eudc-set-server
     This command accessible from `New Server' submenu lets you specify
     a new directory server and protocol.


File: eudc,  Node: Return Attributes,  Next: Duplicate Attributes,  Prev: Selecting a Server,  Up: Querying Servers

Return Attributes
-----------------

   Directory servers may be configured to return a default set of
attributes for each record matching a query if the query specifies none.
The variable `eudc-default-return-attributes' controls the return
attributes you want to see, if different from the server defaults.

 - Variable: eudc-default-return-attributes
     A list of the default attributes to extract from directory
     entries.  If set to the symbol `all' then all available attributes
     are returned. A value of `nil', the default, means to return the
     default attributes as configured in the server.

   The server may return several matching records to a query. Some of
the records may however not contain all the attributes you requested.
You can discard those records.

 - User Option: eudc-strict-return-matches
     If non-`nil', entries that do not contain all the requested return
     attributes are ignored.  Default is `t'.


File: eudc,  Node: Duplicate Attributes,  Prev: Return Attributes,  Up: Querying Servers

Duplicate Attributes
--------------------

   Directory standards may authorize different instances of the same
attribute in a record. For instance the record of a person may contain
several email fields containing different email addresses. When using a
QI directory server this is difficult to distinguish from attributes
having multi-line values such as the postal address that may contain a
line for the street and another one for the zip code and city name. In
both cases, EUDC will consider the attribute duplicated.

   EUDC has several methods to deal with duplicated attributes. The
available methods are:

`list'
     Makes a list with the different values of the duplicate attribute.
     The record is returned with only one instance of the attribute
     with a list of all the different values as a value. This is the
     default method that is used to handle duplicate fields for which
     no other method has been specified.

`first'
     Discards all the duplicate values of the field keeping only the
     first one.

`concat'
     Concatenates the different values using a newline as a separator.
     The record keeps only one instance of the field the value of which
     is a single multi-line string.

`duplicate'
     Duplicates the whole record into as many instances as there are
     different values for the field. This is the default for the email
     field. Thus a record containing 3 different email addresses is
     duplicated into three different records each having a single email
     address. This is particularly useful in combination with `select'
     as the method to handle multiple matches in inline expansion
     queries (*note Inline Query Expansion::) because you are presented
     with the 3 addresses in a selection buffer

   Because a method may not be applicable to all fields, the variable
`eudc-duplicate-attribute-handling-method' lets you specify either a
default method for all fields or a method for each individual field.

 - Variable: eudc-duplicate-attribute-handling-method
     A method to handle entries containing duplicate attributes.  This
     is either an alist of elements `(ATTR . METHOD)', or a symbol
     METHOD.  The alist form of the variable associates a method to an
     individual attribute name; the second form specifies a method
     applicable to all attribute names. Available methods are: `list',
     `first', `concat', and `duplicate' (see above).  The default is
     `list'.


File: eudc,  Node: Query Form,  Next: Display of Query Results,  Prev: Querying Servers,  Up: Usage

Query Form
==========

   The simplest way to query your directory server is to use the query
form. You display the query form with the `Query with Form' menu item
or by invoking the command `M-x eudc-query-form'. The attribute names
presented in this form are defined by the `eudc-query-form-attributes'
variable (unless a non-`nil' argument is supplied to `eudc-query-form').

   Since the different directory protocols to which EUDC interfaces may
use different names for equivalent attributes, EUDC defines its own set
of attribute names and a mapping between these names and their
protocol-specific equivalent through the variable
`eudc-protocol-attributes-translation-alist'.  Names currently defined
by EUDC are `name', `firstname', `email' and `phone'.

 - Variable: eudc-query-form-attributes
     A list of attributes presented in the query form.  Attribute names
     in this list should be either EUDC attribute names or valid
     attribute names.  You can get a list of valid attribute names for
     the current protocol with the `List Valid Attribute Names' menu
     item or the `M-x eudc-get-attribute-list' command.  Defaults to
     `name', `email' and `phone'.

 - Command: eudc-query-form get-fields-from-server
     Display a form to query the directory server.  If given a non-`nil'
     argument the function first queries the server for the existing
     fields and displays a corresponding form.  Not all protocols may
     support a non-`nil' argument here.

   Since the names of the fields may not be explicit enough or adapted
to be directly displayed as prompt strings in the form, the variable
`eudc-user-attribute-names-alist' lets you define more explicit names
for directory attribute names.  This variable is ignored if
`eudc-use-raw-directory-names' is non-`nil'.

 - Variable: eudc-user-attribute-names-alist
     This is an alist of user-defined names for the directory
     attributes used in query/response forms. Prompt strings for
     attributes that are not in this alist are derived by splitting the
     attribute name at underscores and capitalizing the individual
     words.

 - Variable: eudc-use-raw-directory-names
     If non-`nil', use attributes names as defined in the directory.
     Otherwise, directory query/response forms display the user
     attribute names defined in `eudc-user-attribute-names-alist'.


File: eudc,  Node: Display of Query Results,  Next: Inline Query Expansion,  Prev: Query Form,  Up: Usage

Display of Query Results
========================

   Upon successful completion of a form query, EUDC will display a
buffer containing the results of the query.

   The fields that are returned for each record are controlled by
`eudc-default-return-attributes' (*note Return Attributes::).

   The display of each individual field can be performed by an arbitrary
function which allows specific processing for binary values, such as
images or audio samples, as well as values with semantics, such as URLs.

 - Variable: eudc-attribute-display-method-alist
     An alist specifying methods to display attribute values.  Each
     member of the list is of the form `(NAME . FUNC)' where NAME is a
     lowercased string naming a directory attribute (translated
     according to `eudc-user-attribute-names-alist' if
     `eudc-use-raw-directory-names' is non-nil) and FUNC a function
     that will be passed the corresponding attribute values for display.

   This variable has protocol-local definitions (see *note
Server/Protocol Locals::).  For instance, it is defined as follows for
LDAP:

     (eudc-protocol-set 'eudc-attribute-display-method-alist
                        '(("jpegphoto" . eudc-display-jpeg-inline)
                          ("labeledurl" . eudc-display-url)
                          ("audio" . eudc-display-sound)
                          ("labeledurl" . eudc-display-url)
                          ("url" . eudc-display-url))
                        'ldap)

   EUDC provides a set of built-in functions to display binary value
types:

 - Function: eudc-display-generic-binary data
     Display a button for unidentified binary DATA.

 - Function: eudc-display-url url
     Display URL and make it clickable.

 - Function: eudc-display-sound data
     Display a button to play the sound DATA.

 - Function: eudc-display-jpeg-inline data
     Display the JPEG DATA inline at point if possible.

 - Function: eudc-display-jpeg-as-button data
     Display a button for the JPEG DATA.

   Right-clicking on a binary value button pops up a contextual menu
with options to process the value.  Among these are saving the attribute
value to a file or sending it to an external viewer command.  External
viewers should expect the value on their standard input and should
display it or perform arbitrary processing on it.  Messages sent to
standard output are discarded.  External viewers are listed in the
variable `eudc-external-viewers' which you can customize.

 - Variable: eudc-external-viewers
     This is a list of viewer program specifications.  Each
     specification is a list whose first element is a string naming the
     viewer for unique identification, the second element is the
     executable program which should be invoked and the following
     elements are arguments that should be passed to the program.


File: eudc,  Node: Inline Query Expansion,  Next: The Server Hotlist,  Prev: Display of Query Results,  Up: Usage

Inline Query Expansion
======================

   Inline query expansion is a powerful method to get completion from
your directory server.  The most common usage is for expanding names to
email addresses in mail message buffers.  The expansion is performed by
the command `M-x eudc-expand-inline' which is available from the
`Expand Inline Query' menu item but can also be conveniently bound to a
key shortcut (*note Installation::).  The operation is controlled by
the variables `eudc-inline-expansion-format',
`eudc-inline-query-format', `eudc-expanding-overwrites-query' and
`eudc-multiple-match-handling-method'.

   If the query fails for a server, other servers may be tried
successively until one of them finds a match (*note Multi-server
Queries::).

 - Command: eudc-expand-inline replace-p
     Query the server and expand the query string before point.  The
     query string consists of the buffer substring from the point back
     to the preceding comma, colon or beginning of line.
     `eudc-inline-query-format' controls how individual words are
     mapped onto directory attribute names.  After querying the server
     for the given string, the expansion specified by
     `eudc-inline-expansion-format' is inserted in the buffer at point.
     If REPLACE-P is `t' then this expansion replaces the query string
     in the buffer.  If `eudc-expanding-overwrites-query' is non-`nil'
     then the meaning of REPLACE-P is negated.

 - Variable: eudc-inline-query-format
     Format of an inline expansion query.  This is actually a list of
     FORMATs.  A FORMAT is a list of one or more EUDC attribute names.
     A FORMAT applies if it contains as many attributes as individual
     words in the inline query string.  If several FORMATs apply then
     they are tried in order until a match is found.  If `nil' all the
     words will be mapped onto the default server/protocol attribute
     name (generally `name').

     For instance, use the following
          (setq eudc-inline-query-format '((name)
                                           (firstname)
                                           (firstname name)))

     to indicate that single word expansion queries are to be
     considered as surnames and if no match is found then they should
     be tried as first names.  Inline queries consisting of two words
     are considered as consisting of a first name followed by a
     surname.  If the query consists of more than two words, then the
     first one is considered as the first name and the remaining words
     are all considered as surname constituents.

     FORMATs are in fact not limited to EUDC attribute names, you can
     use server or protocol specific names in them.  It may be safer if
     you do so, to set the variable `eudc-inline-query-format' in a
     protocol or server local fashion (see *note Server/Protocol
     Locals::).

     For instance you could use the following to match up to three words
     against the `cn' attribute of LDAP servers:
          (eudc-protocol-set 'eudc-inline-query-format
                             '((cn)
                               (cn cn)
                               (cn cn cn))
                             'ldap)

 - Variable: eudc-inline-expansion-format
     This variable lets you control exactly what is inserted into the
     buffer upon an inline expansion request.  It is a list whose first
     element is a string passed to `format'.  Remaining elements are
     symbols corresponding to directory attribute names.  The
     corresponding attribute values are passed as additional arguments
     to `format'.  Default is `("%s" email)' but you may want to
     consider a value like `("%s <%s>" name email)'

 - Variable: eudc-multiple-match-handling-method
     This variable controls what to do when multiple entries match a
     query for an inline expansion.  Possible values are:
    `first'
          The first match is considered as being the only one, the
          others are discarded.

    `select'
          A selection buffer pops up where you can choose a particular
          match.  This is the default value of the variable.

    `all'
          The expansion uses all records successively

    `abort'
          An error is signaled.  The expansion aborts.

     Default is `select'

The Server Hotlist
==================

   EUDC lets you maintain a list of frequently used servers so that you
can easily switch from one to another.  This hotlist appears in the
`Server' submenu.  You select a server in this list by clicking on its
name.  You can add the current server to the list with the command `M-x
eudc-bookmark-current-server'.  The list is contained in the variable
`eudc-server-hotlist' which is stored in and retrieved from the file
designated by `eudc-options-file'.  EUDC also provides a facility to
edit the hotlist interactively (*note The Hotlist Edit Buffer::).

   The hotlist is also used to make queries on multiple servers
successively (*note Multi-server Queries::).  The order in which the
servers are tried is the order they appear in the hotlist, therefore it
is important to sort the hotlist appropriately.

 - Command: eudc-bookmark-server server
     Add SERVER to the hotlist of servers

 - Command: eudc-bookmark-current-server
     Add the current server to the hotlist of servers

 - Variable: eudc-options-file
     The name of a file where EUDC stores its internal variables (the
     hotlist and the current server).  EUDC will try to load that file
     upon initialization so, if you choose a file name different from
     the defaults `~/.eudc-options', be sure to set this variable to
     the appropriate value _before_ EUDC is itself loaded.

====================

   When using inline query expansion (*note Inline Query Expansion::),
EUDC can try to query successively a sequence of directory servers
until one of them successfully finds a match for the query.

 - Variable: eudc-inline-expansion-servers
     This variable controls which servers are tried and in which order
     when trying to perform an inline query.  Possible values are:
    `current-server'
          Only the current directory server is tried

    `hotlist'
          The servers in the hotlist are tried in order until one finds
          a match for the query or `eudc-max-servers-to-query' is
          reached

    `server-then-hotlist'
          The current server then the servers in the hotlist are tried
          in the order they appear in the hotlist until one of them
          finds a match or `eudc-max-servers-to-query' is reached.
          This is the default.

 - Variable: eudc-max-servers-to-query
     This variable indicates the maximum number of servers to query when
     performing a multi-server query.  The default, `nil', indicates
     that all available servers should be tried.

Creating BBDB Records
=====================

   With EUDC, you can automatically create BBDB records (*note BBDB:
(bbdb)Top.) from records you get from a directory server.  You do this
by moving point to the appropriate record in a query result display
buffer and invoking the command `M-x
eudc-insert-record-at-point-into-bbdb' with the keyboard binding
`b'(1), or with the menu.  EUDC cannot update an existing BBDB record
and will signal an error if you try to insert a record matching an
existing one.

   It is also possible to export to BBDB the whole batch of records
contained in the directory query result with the command `M-x
eudc-batch-export-records-to-bbdb'.

   Because directory systems may not enforce a strict record format,
local server installations may use different attribute names and have
different ways to organize the information.  Furthermore BBDB has its
own record structure.  For these reasons converting a record from its
external directory format to the BBDB format is a highly customizable
process.

 - Variable: eudc-bbdb-conversion-alist
     The value of this variable should be a symbol naming an alist
     defining a mapping between BBDB field names onto directory
     attribute names records.  This is a protocol-local variable and is
     initialized upon protocol switch (*note Server/Protocol Locals::).
     The alist is made of cells of the form `(BBDB-FIELD .
     SPEC-OR-LIST)'.  BBDB-FIELD is the name of a field that must be
     defined in your BBDB environment (standard field names are `name',
     `company', `net', `phone', `address' and `notes').  SPEC-OR-LIST
     is either a single mapping specification or a list of mapping
     specifications.  Lists of mapping specifications are valid for the
     `phone' and `address' BBDB fields only. SPECs are actually
     s-expressions which are evaluated as follows:

    a string
          evaluates to itself

    a symbol
          evaluates to the symbol value.  Symbols corresponding to
          directory attribute names present in the record evaluate to
          the value of the field in the record

    a form
          is evaluated as a function.  The argument list may contain
          attribute names which evaluate to the corresponding values in
          the record.  The form evaluation should return something
          appropriate for the particular BBDB-FIELD (see
          `bbdb-create-internal').  `eudc-bbdbify-phone' and
          `eudc-bbdbify-address' are provided as convenience functions
          to parse phones and addresses.

   The default value of the PH-specific value of that variable is
`eudc-ph-bbdb-conversion-alist':

     ((name . name)
      (net . email)
      (address . (eudc-bbdbify-address address "Address"))
      (phone . ((eudc-bbdbify-phone phone "Phone")
                (eudc-bbdbify-phone office_phone "Office Phone"))))

   This means that:

   * the `name' field of the BBDB record gets its value from the `name'
     attribute of the directory record

   * the `net' field of the BBDB record gets its value from the `email'
     attribute of the directory record

   * the `address' field of the BBDB record is obtained by parsing the
     `address' attribute of the directory record with the function
     `eudc-bbdbify-address'

   * two `phone' fields are created (when possible) in the BBDB record.
     The first one has `Phone' for location and its value is obtained by
     parsing the `phone' attribute of the PH/QI record with the function
     `eudc-bbdbify-phone'.  The second one has `Office Phone' for
     location its value is obtained by parsing the `office_phone'
     attribute of the PH/QI record with the function
     `eudc-bbdbify-phone'.

 - Function: eudc-bbdbify-phone phone location
     This is a convenience function provided for use in
     `eudc-bbdb-conversion-alist'.  It parses PHONE into a vector
     compatible with `bbdb-create-internal'.  PHONE is either a string
     supposedly containing a phone number or a list of such strings
     which are concatenated. LOCATION is used as the phone location for
     BBDB.

 - Function: eudc-bbdbify-address addr location
     This is a convenience function provided for use in
     `eudc-bbdb-conversion-alist'.  It parses ADDR into a vector
     compatible with `bbdb-create-internal'.  ADDR should be an address
     string of no more than four lines or a list of lines.  The last
     line is searched for the zip code, city and state name.  LOCATION
     is used as the phone location for BBDB.

   Note that only a subset of the attributes you selected with
`eudc-default-return-attributes' and that are actually displayed may
actually be inserted as part of the newly created BBDB record.

   (1) This key binding does not actually call
`eudc-insert-record-at-point-into-bbdb' but uses `eudc-try-bbdb-insert'
instead.

Server/Protocol Locals
======================

   EUDC can be customized independently for each server or directory
protocol.  All variables can be given local bindings that are activated
when a particular server and/or protocol becomes active.  This is much
like buffer-local bindings but on a per server or per protocol basis.

Manipulating local bindings
---------------------------

   EUDC offers functions that let you set and query variables on a per
server or per protocol basis.

   The following predicates allow you to test the existence of
server/protocol local bindings for a particular variable.

 - Function: eudc-server-local-variable-p var
     Return non-`nil' if VAR has server-local bindings

 - Function: eudc-protocol-local-variable-p var
     Return non-`nil' if VAR has protocol-local bindings

   The following functions allow you to set the value of a variable with
various degrees of locality.

 - Function: eudc-default-set var val
     Set the EUDC default value of VAR to VAL.  The current binding of
     VAR (if local to the current server or protocol) is not changed.

 - Function: eudc-protocol-set var val &optional protocol
     Set the binding of VAR local to PROTOCOL to VAL.  If omitted,
     PROTOCOL defaults to the current value of `eudc-protocol'.  The
     current binding of VAR is changed only if PROTOCOL is omitted.

 - Function: eudc-server-set var val &optional server
     Set the binding of VAR local to SERVER to VAL.  If omitted, SERVER
     defaults to the current value of `eudc-server'.  The current
     binding of VAR is changed only if SERVER is omitted.

 - Function: eudc-set var val
     Set the most local (server, protocol or default) binding of VAR to
     VAL.  The current binding of VAR is also set to VAL.

   The following variables allow you to query the various bindings of a
variable (local or non-local).

 - Function: eudc-variable-default-value var
     Return the default binding of VAR (outside of a particular server
     or protocol local binding).  Return `unbound' if VAR has no EUDC
     default value.

 - Function: eudc-variable-protocol-value var &optional protocol
     Return the value of VAR local to PROTOCOL.  Return `unbound' if
     VAR has no value local to PROTOCOL.  PROTOCOL defaults to
     `eudc-protocol'.

 - Function: eudc-variable-server-value var [server]
     Return the value of VAR local to SERVER.  Return `unbound' if VAR
     has no value local to SERVER.  SERVER defaults to `eudc-server'.

   Changing a protocol-local or server-local value of a variable has no
effect on its current value.  The following command is used to
synchronize the current values of variables with their local values
given the current `eudc-server' and `eudc-protocol':

 - Function: eudc-update-local-variables
     Update all EUDC variables according to their local settings.
