Starting Gnus
*************

   If your system administrator has set things up properly, starting
Gnus and reading news is extremely easy--you just type `M-x gnus' in
your Emacs.

   If you want to start Gnus in a different frame, you can use the
command `M-x gnus-other-frame' instead.

   If things do not go smoothly at startup, you have to twiddle some
variables in your `~/.gnus' file.  This file is similar to `~/.emacs',
but is read when gnus starts.

   If you puzzle at any terms used in this manual, please refer to the
terminology section (*note Terminology::).

* The First Time::      What does Gnus do the first time you start it?
* The Server is Down::  How can I read my mail then?

Finding the News
================

   The `gnus-select-method' variable says where Gnus should look for
news.  This variable should be a list where the first element says
"how" and the second element says "where".  This method is your native
method.  All groups not fetched with this method are foreign groups.

   For instance, if the `news.somewhere.edu' NNTP server is where you
want to get your daily dosage of news from, you'd say:

     (setq gnus-select-method '(nntp "news.somewhere.edu"))

   If you want to read directly from the local spool, say:

     (setq gnus-select-method '(nnspool ""))

   If you can use a local spool, you probably should, as it will almost
certainly be much faster.

   If this variable is not set, Gnus will take a look at the
`NNTPSERVER' environment variable.  If that variable isn't set, Gnus
will see whether `gnus-nntpserver-file' (`/etc/nntpserver' by default)
has any opinions on the matter.  If that fails as well, Gnus will try
to use the machine running Emacs as an NNTP server.  That's a long
shot, though.

   If `gnus-nntp-server' is set, this variable will override
`gnus-select-method'.  You should therefore set `gnus-nntp-server' to
`nil', which is what it is by default.

   You can also make Gnus prompt you interactively for the name of an
NNTP server.  If you give a non-numerical prefix to `gnus' (i.e., `C-u
M-x gnus'), Gnus will let you choose between the servers in the
`gnus-secondary-servers' list (if any).  You can also just type in the
name of any server you feel like visiting.  (Note that this will set
`gnus-nntp-server', which means that if you then `M-x gnus' later in
the same Emacs session, Gnus will contact the same server.)

   However, if you use one NNTP server regularly and are just
interested in a couple of groups from a different server, you would be
better served by using the `B' command in the group buffer.  It will
let you have a look at what groups are available, and you can subscribe
to any of the groups you want to.  This also makes `.newsrc'
maintenance much tidier.  *Note Foreign Groups::.

   A slightly different approach to foreign groups is to set the
`gnus-secondary-select-methods' variable.  The select methods listed in
this variable are in many ways just as native as the
`gnus-select-method' server.  They will also be queried for active
files during startup (if that's required), and new newsgroups that
appear on these servers will be subscribed (or not) just as native
groups are.

   For instance, if you use the `nnmbox' back end to read your mail,
you would typically set this variable to

     (setq gnus-secondary-select-methods '((nnmbox "")))

The First Time
==============

   If no startup files exist, Gnus will try to determine what groups
should be subscribed by default.

   If the variable `gnus-default-subscribed-newsgroups' is set, Gnus
will subscribe you to just those groups in that list, leaving the rest
killed.  Your system administrator should have set this variable to
something useful.

   Since she hasn't, Gnus will just subscribe you to a few arbitrarily
picked groups (i.e., `*.newusers').  ("Arbitrary" is defined here as
"whatever Lars thinks you should read".)

   You'll also be subscribed to the Gnus documentation group, which
should help you with most common problems.

   If `gnus-default-subscribed-newsgroups' is `t', Gnus will just use
the normal functions for handling new groups, and not do anything
special.


File: gnus,  Node: The Server is Down,  Next: Slave Gnusae,  Prev: The First Time,  Up: Starting Up

The Server is Down
==================

   If the default server is down, Gnus will understandably have some
problems starting.  However, if you have some mail groups in addition to
the news groups, you may want to start Gnus anyway.

   Gnus, being the trusting sort of program, will ask whether to proceed
without a native select method if that server can't be contacted.  This
will happen whether the server doesn't actually exist (i.e., you have
given the wrong address) or the server has just momentarily taken ill
for some reason or other.  If you decide to continue and have no foreign
groups, you'll find it difficult to actually do anything in the group
buffer.  But, hey, that's your problem.  Blllrph!

   If you know that the server is definitely down, or you just want to
read your mail without bothering with the server at all, you can use the
`gnus-no-server' command to start Gnus.  That might come in handy if
you're in a hurry as well.  This command will not attempt to contact
your primary server--instead, it will just activate all groups on level
1 and 2.  (You should preferably keep no native groups on those two
levels.)


File: gnus,  Node: Slave Gnusae,  Next: Fetching a Group,  Prev: The Server is Down,  Up: Starting Up

Slave Gnusae
============

   You might want to run more than one Emacs with more than one Gnus at
the same time.  If you are using different `.newsrc' files (e.g., if you
are using the two different Gnusae to read from two different servers),
that is no problem whatsoever.  You just do it.

   The problem appears when you want to run two Gnusae that use the same
`.newsrc' file.

   To work around that problem some, we here at the Think-Tank at the
Gnus Towers have come up with a new concept: "Masters" and "slaves".
(We have applied for a patent on this concept, and have taken out a
copyright on those words.  If you wish to use those words in
conjunction with each other, you have to send $1 per usage instance to
me.  Usage of the patent ("Master/Slave Relationships In Computer
Applications") will be much more expensive, of course.)

   Anyway, you start one Gnus up the normal way with `M-x gnus' (or
however you do it).  Each subsequent slave Gnusae should be started with
`M-x gnus-slave'.  These slaves won't save normal `.newsrc' files, but
instead save "slave files" that contain information only on what groups
have been read in the slave session.  When a master Gnus starts, it
will read (and delete) these slave files, incorporating all information
from them.  (The slave files will be read in the sequence they were
created, so the latest changes will have precedence.)

   Information from the slave files has, of course, precedence over the
information in the normal (i.e., master) `.newsrc' file.


File: gnus,  Node: Fetching a Group,  Next: New Groups,  Prev: Slave Gnusae,  Up: Starting Up

Fetching a Group
================

   It is sometimes convenient to be able to just say "I want to read
this group and I don't care whether Gnus has been started or not".
This is perhaps more useful for people who write code than for users,
but the command `gnus-fetch-group' provides this functionality in any
case.  It takes the group name as a parameter.


File: gnus,  Node: New Groups,  Next: Startup Files,  Prev: Fetching a Group,  Up: Starting Up

New Groups
==========

   If you are satisfied that you really never want to see any new
groups, you can set `gnus-check-new-newsgroups' to `nil'.  This will
also save you some time at startup.  Even if this variable is `nil',
you can always subscribe to the new groups just by pressing `U' in the
group buffer (*note Group Maintenance::).  This variable is
`ask-server' by default.  If you set this variable to `always', then
Gnus will query the back ends for new groups even when you do the `g'
command (*note Scanning New Messages::).

* Menu:

* Checking New Groups::      Determining what groups are new.
* Subscription Methods::     What Gnus should do with new groups.
* Filtering New Groups::     Making Gnus ignore certain new groups.


File: gnus,  Node: Checking New Groups,  Next: Subscription Methods,  Up: New Groups

Checking New Groups
-------------------

   Gnus normally determines whether a group is new or not by comparing
the list of groups from the active file(s) with the lists of subscribed
and dead groups.  This isn't a particularly fast method.  If
`gnus-check-new-newsgroups' is `ask-server', Gnus will ask the server
for new groups since the last time.  This is both faster and cheaper.
This also means that you can get rid of the list of killed groups
altogether, so you may set `gnus-save-killed-list' to `nil', which will
save time both at startup, at exit, and all over.  Saves disk space,
too.  Why isn't this the default, then?  Unfortunately, not all servers
support this command.

   I bet I know what you're thinking now: How do I find out whether my
server supports `ask-server'?  No?  Good, because I don't have a
fail-safe answer.  I would suggest just setting this variable to
`ask-server' and see whether any new groups appear within the next few
days.  If any do, then it works.  If none do, then it doesn't work.  I
could write a function to make Gnus guess whether the server supports
`ask-server', but it would just be a guess.  So I won't.  You could
`telnet' to the server and say `HELP' and see whether it lists
`NEWGROUPS' among the commands it understands.  If it does, then it
might work.  (But there are servers that lists `NEWGROUPS' without
supporting the function properly.)

   This variable can also be a list of select methods.  If so, Gnus will
issue an `ask-server' command to each of the select methods, and
subscribe them (or not) using the normal methods.  This might be handy
if you are monitoring a few servers for new groups.  A side effect is
that startup will take much longer, so you can meditate while waiting.
Use the mantra "dingnusdingnusdingnus" to achieve permanent bliss.


File: gnus,  Node: Subscription Methods,  Next: Filtering New Groups,  Prev: Checking New Groups,  Up: New Groups

Subscription Methods
--------------------

   What Gnus does when it encounters a new group is determined by the
`gnus-subscribe-newsgroup-method' variable.

   This variable should contain a function.  This function will be
called with the name of the new group as the only parameter.

   Some handy pre-fab functions are:

`gnus-subscribe-zombies'
     Make all new groups zombies.  This is the default.  You can browse
     the zombies later (with `A z') and either kill them all off
     properly (with `S z'), or subscribe to them (with `u').

`gnus-subscribe-randomly'
     Subscribe all new groups in arbitrary order.  This really means
     that all new groups will be added at "the top" of the group buffer.

`gnus-subscribe-alphabetically'
     Subscribe all new groups in alphabetical order.

`gnus-subscribe-hierarchically'
     Subscribe all new groups hierarchically.  The difference between
     this function and `gnus-subscribe-alphabetically' is slight.
     `gnus-subscribe-alphabetically' will subscribe new groups in a
     strictly alphabetical fashion, while this function will enter
     groups into its hierarchy.  So if you want to have the `rec'
     hierarchy before the `comp' hierarchy, this function will not mess
     that configuration up.  Or something like that.

`gnus-subscribe-interactively'
     Subscribe new groups interactively.  This means that Gnus will ask
     you about *all* new groups.  The groups you choose to subscribe to
     will be subscribed hierarchically.

`gnus-subscribe-killed'
     Kill all new groups.

`gnus-subscribe-topics'
     Put the groups into the topic that has a matching `subscribe' topic
     parameter (*note Topic Parameters::).  For instance, a `subscribe'
     topic parameter that looks like

          "nnslashdot"

     will mean that all groups that match that regex will be subscribed
     under that topic.

     If no topics match the groups, the groups will be subscribed in the
     top-level topic.

   A closely related variable is
`gnus-subscribe-hierarchical-interactive'.  (That's quite a mouthful.)
If this variable is non-`nil', Gnus will ask you in a hierarchical
fashion whether to subscribe to new groups or not.  Gnus will ask you
for each sub-hierarchy whether you want to descend the hierarchy or not.

   One common mistake is to set the variable a few paragraphs above
(`gnus-subscribe-newsgroup-method') to
`gnus-subscribe-hierarchical-interactive'.  This is an error.  This
will not work.  This is ga-ga.  So don't do it.


File: gnus,  Node: Filtering New Groups,  Prev: Subscription Methods,  Up: New Groups

Filtering New Groups
--------------------

   A nice and portable way to control which new newsgroups should be
subscribed (or ignored) is to put an "options" line at the start of the
`.newsrc' file.  Here's an example:

     options -n !alt.all !rec.all sci.all

   This line obviously belongs to a serious-minded intellectual
scientific person (or she may just be plain old boring), because it
says that all groups that have names beginning with `alt' and `rec'
should be ignored, and all groups with names beginning with `sci' should
be subscribed.  Gnus will not use the normal subscription method for
subscribing these groups.  `gnus-subscribe-options-newsgroup-method' is
used instead.  This variable defaults to
`gnus-subscribe-alphabetically'.

   If you don't want to mess with your `.newsrc' file, you can just set
the two variables `gnus-options-subscribe' and
`gnus-options-not-subscribe'.  These two variables do exactly the same
as the `.newsrc' `options -n' trick.  Both are regexps, and if the new
group matches the former, it will be unconditionally subscribed, and if
it matches the latter, it will be ignored.

   Yet another variable that meddles here is
`gnus-auto-subscribed-groups'.  It works exactly like
`gnus-options-subscribe', and is therefore really superfluous, but I
thought it would be nice to have two of these.  This variable is more
meant for setting some ground rules, while the other variable is used
more for user fiddling.  By default this variable makes all new groups
that come from mail back ends (`nnml', `nnbabyl', `nnfolder', `nnmbox',
and `nnmh') subscribed.  If you don't like that, just set this variable
to `nil'.

   New groups that match this regexp are subscribed using
`gnus-subscribe-options-newsgroup-method'.


File: gnus,  Node: Changing Servers,  Next: Startup Variables,  Prev: The Active File,  Up: Starting Up

Changing Servers
================

   Sometimes it is necessary to move from one NNTP server to another.
This happens very rarely, but perhaps you change jobs, or one server is
very flaky and you want to use another.

   Changing the server is pretty easy, right?  You just change
`gnus-select-method' to point to the new server?

   _Wrong!_

   Article numbers are not (in any way) kept synchronized between
different NNTP servers, and the only way Gnus keeps track of what
articles you have read is by keeping track of article numbers.  So when
you change `gnus-select-method', your `.newsrc' file becomes worthless.

   Gnus provides a few functions to attempt to translate a `.newsrc'
file from one server to another.  They all have one thing in
common--they take a looong time to run.  You don't want to use these
functions more than absolutely necessary.

   If you have access to both servers, Gnus can request the headers for
all the articles you have read and compare `Message-ID's and map the
article numbers of the read articles and article marks.  The `M-x
gnus-change-server' command will do this for all your native groups.  It
will prompt for the method you want to move to.

   You can also move individual groups with the `M-x
gnus-group-move-group-to-server' command.  This is useful if you want to
move a (foreign) group from one server to another.

   If you don't have access to both the old and new server, all your
marks and read ranges have become worthless.  You can use the `M-x
gnus-group-clear-data-on-native-groups' command to clear out all data
that you have on your native groups.  Use with caution.

   After changing servers, you *must* move the cache hierarchy away,
since the cached articles will have wrong article numbers, which will
affect which articles Gnus thinks are read.


File: gnus,  Node: Startup Files,  Next: Auto Save,  Prev: New Groups,  Up: Starting Up

Startup Files
=============

   Now, you all know about the `.newsrc' file.  All subscription
information is traditionally stored in this file.

   Things got a bit more complicated with GNUS.  In addition to keeping
the `.newsrc' file updated, it also used a file called `.newsrc.el' for
storing all the information that didn't fit into the `.newsrc' file.
(Actually, it also duplicated everything in the `.newsrc' file.)  GNUS
would read whichever one of these files was the most recently saved,
which enabled people to swap between GNUS and other newsreaders.

   That was kinda silly, so Gnus went one better: In addition to the
`.newsrc' and `.newsrc.el' files, Gnus also has a file called
`.newsrc.eld'.  It will read whichever of these files that are most
recent, but it will never write a `.newsrc.el' file.  You should never
delete the `.newsrc.eld' file--it contains much information not stored
in the `.newsrc' file.

   You can turn off writing the `.newsrc' file by setting
`gnus-save-newsrc-file' to `nil', which means you can delete the file
and save some space, as well as exiting from Gnus faster.  However,
this will make it impossible to use other newsreaders than Gnus.  But
hey, who would want to, right?  Similarly, setting
`gnus-read-newsrc-file' to `nil' makes Gnus ignore the `.newsrc' file
and any `.newsrc-SERVER' files, which is convenient if you have a
tendency to use Netscape once in a while.

   If `gnus-save-killed-list' (default `t') is `nil', Gnus will not
save the list of killed groups to the startup file.  This will save
both time (when starting and quitting) and space (on disk).  It will
also mean that Gnus has no record of what groups are new or old, so the
automatic new groups subscription methods become meaningless.  You
should always set `gnus-check-new-newsgroups' to `nil' or `ask-server'
if you set this variable to `nil' (*note New Groups::).  This variable
can also be a regular expression.  If that's the case, remove all
groups that do not match this regexp before saving.  This can be useful
in certain obscure situations that involve several servers where not
all servers support `ask-server'.

   The `gnus-startup-file' variable says where the startup files are.
The default value is `~/.newsrc', with the Gnus (El Dingo) startup file
being whatever that one is, with a `.eld' appended.

   `gnus-save-newsrc-hook' is called before saving any of the newsrc
files, while `gnus-save-quick-newsrc-hook' is called just before saving
the `.newsrc.eld' file, and `gnus-save-standard-newsrc-hook' is called
just before saving the `.newsrc' file.  The latter two are commonly
used to turn version control on or off.  Version control is on by
default when saving the startup files.  If you want to turn backup
creation off, say something like:

     (defun turn-off-backup ()
       (set (make-local-variable 'backup-inhibited) t))
     
     (add-hook 'gnus-save-quick-newsrc-hook 'turn-off-backup)
     (add-hook 'gnus-save-standard-newsrc-hook 'turn-off-backup)

   When Gnus starts, it will read the `gnus-site-init-file'
(`.../site-lisp/gnus' by default) and `gnus-init-file' (`~/.gnus' by
default) files.  These are normal Emacs Lisp files and can be used to
avoid cluttering your `~/.emacs' and `site-init' files with Gnus stuff.
Gnus will also check for files with the same names as these, but with
`.elc' and `.el' suffixes.  In other words, if you have set
`gnus-init-file' to `~/.gnus', it will look for `~/.gnus.elc',
`~/.gnus.el', and finally `~/.gnus' (in this order).


File: gnus,  Node: Auto Save,  Next: The Active File,  Prev: Startup Files,  Up: Starting Up

Auto Save
=========

   Whenever you do something that changes the Gnus data (reading
articles, catching up, killing/subscribing groups), the change is added
to a special "dribble buffer".  This buffer is auto-saved the normal
Emacs way.  If your Emacs should crash before you have saved the
`.newsrc' files, all changes you have made can be recovered from this
file.

   If Gnus detects this file at startup, it will ask the user whether to
read it.  The auto save file is deleted whenever the real startup file
is saved.

   If `gnus-use-dribble-file' is `nil', Gnus won't create and maintain
a dribble buffer.  The default is `t'.

   Gnus will put the dribble file(s) in `gnus-dribble-directory'.  If
this variable is `nil', which it is by default, Gnus will dribble into
the directory where the `.newsrc' file is located.  (This is normally
the user's home directory.)  The dribble file will get the same file
permissions as the `.newsrc' file.

   If `gnus-always-read-dribble-file' is non-`nil', Gnus will read the
dribble file on startup without querying the user.


File: gnus,  Node: The Active File,  Next: Changing Servers,  Prev: Auto Save,  Up: Starting Up

The Active File
===============

   When Gnus starts, or indeed whenever it tries to determine whether
new articles have arrived, it reads the active file.  This is a very
large file that lists all the active groups and articles on the server.

   Before examining the active file, Gnus deletes all lines that match
the regexp `gnus-ignored-newsgroups'.  This is done primarily to reject
any groups with bogus names, but you can use this variable to make Gnus
ignore hierarchies you aren't ever interested in.  However, this is not
recommended.  In fact, it's highly discouraged.  Instead, *note New
Groups:: for an overview of other variables that can be used instead.

   The active file can be rather Huge, so if you have a slow network,
you can set `gnus-read-active-file' to `nil' to prevent Gnus from
reading the active file.  This variable is `some' by default.

   Gnus will try to make do by getting information just on the groups
that you actually subscribe to.

   Note that if you subscribe to lots and lots of groups, setting this
variable to `nil' will probably make Gnus slower, not faster.  At
present, having this variable `nil' will slow Gnus down considerably,
unless you read news over a 2400 baud modem.

   This variable can also have the value `some'.  Gnus will then
attempt to read active info only on the subscribed groups.  On some
servers this is quite fast (on sparkling, brand new INN servers that
support the `LIST ACTIVE group' command), on others this isn't fast at
all.  In any case, `some' should be faster than `nil', and is certainly
faster than `t' over slow lines.

   Some news servers (old versions of Leafnode and old versions of INN,
for instance) do not support the `LIST ACTIVE group'.  For these
servers, `nil' is probably the most efficient value for this variable.

   If this variable is `nil', Gnus will ask for group info in total
lock-step, which isn't very fast.  If it is `some' and you use an NNTP
server, Gnus will pump out commands as fast as it can, and read all the
replies in one swoop.  This will normally result in better performance,
but if the server does not support the aforementioned `LIST ACTIVE
group' command, this isn't very nice to the server.

   If you think that starting up Gnus takes too long, try all the three
different values for this variable and see what works best for you.

   In any case, if you use `some' or `nil', you should definitely kill
all groups that you aren't interested in to speed things up.

   Note that this variable also affects active file retrieval from
secondary select methods.

Startup Variables
=================

`gnus-load-hook'
     A hook run while Gnus is being loaded.  Note that this hook will
     normally be run just once in each Emacs session, no matter how many
     times you start Gnus.

`gnus-before-startup-hook'
     A hook run after starting up Gnus successfully.

`gnus-startup-hook'
     A hook run as the very last thing after starting up Gnus

`gnus-started-hook'
     A hook that is run as the very last thing after starting up Gnus
     successfully.

`gnus-setup-news-hook'
     A hook that is run after reading the `.newsrc' file(s), but before
     generating the group buffer.

`gnus-check-bogus-newsgroups'
     If non-`nil', Gnus will check for and delete all bogus groups at
     startup.  A "bogus group" is a group that you have in your
     `.newsrc' file, but doesn't exist on the news server.  Checking for
     bogus groups can take quite a while, so to save time and resources
     it's best to leave this option off, and do the checking for bogus
     groups once in a while from the group buffer instead (*note Group
     Maintenance::).

`gnus-inhibit-startup-message'
     If non-`nil', the startup message won't be displayed.  That way,
     your boss might not notice as easily that you are reading news
     instead of doing your job.  Note that this variable is used before
     `.gnus.el' is loaded, so it should be set in `.emacs' instead.

`gnus-no-groups-message'
     Message displayed by Gnus when no groups are available.

`gnus-play-startup-jingle'
     If non-`nil', play the Gnus jingle at startup.

`gnus-startup-jingle'
     Jingle to be played if the above variable is non-`nil'.  The
     default is `Tuxedomoon.Jingle4.au'.
