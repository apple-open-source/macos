Viper
*****

   We believe that one or more of the following statements are adequate
descriptions:

     Viper Is a Package for Emacs Rebels;
     it is a VI Plan for Emacs Rescue
     and/or a venomous VI PERil.

   Technically speaking, Viper is a Vi emulation package for Emacs.  It
implements all Vi and Ex commands, occasionally improving on them and
adding many new features.  It gives the user the best of both worlds: Vi
keystrokes for editing combined with the power of the Emacs environment.

   Viper emulates Vi at several levels, from the one that closely
follows Vi conventions to the one that departs from many of them.  It
has many customizable options, which can be used to tailor Viper to the
work habits of various users.  This manual describes Viper,
concentrating on the differences from Vi and new features of Viper.

   Viper, formerly known as VIP-19, was written by Michael Kifer.  It
is based on VIP version 3.5 by Masahiko Sato and VIP version 4.4 by
Aamod Sane.  Viper tries to be compatible with these packages.

   Viper is intended to be usable without reading this manual -- the
defaults are set to make Viper as close to Vi as possible.  At startup,
Viper will try to set the most appropriate default environment for you,
based on your familiarity with Emacs.  It will also tell you the basic
GNU Emacs window management commands to help you start immediately.

   Although this manual explains how to customize Viper, some basic
familiarity with Emacs Lisp would be a plus.

   It is recommended that you read the Overview node.  The other nodes
may be visited as needed.

   Comments and bug reports are welcome.  `kifer@cs.sunysb.edu' is the
current address for Viper bug reports.  Please use the Ex command
`:submitReport' for this purpose.

Overview of Viper
*****************

   Viper is a Vi emulation on top of Emacs.  At the same time, Viper
provides a virtually unrestricted access to Emacs facilities.  Perfect
compatibility with Vi is possible but not desirable.  This chapter
tells you about the Emacs ideas that you should know about, how to use
Viper within Emacs and some incompatibilities.

   This manual is written with the assumption that you are an
experienced Vi user who wants to switch to Emacs while retaining the
ability to edit files Vi style. Incredible as it might seem, there are
experienced Emacs users who use Viper as a backdoor into the superior
(as every Vi user already knows) world of Vi! These users are well
familiar with Emacs bindings and prefer them in some cases, especially
in the Vi Insert state. John Hawkins <jshawkin@eecs.umich.edu> has
provided a set of customizations, which enables additional Emacs
bindings under Viper.  These customizations can be included in your
`~/.viper' file and are found at the following URL:
`http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~jshawkin/viper-sample'.

   Viper was formerly known as VIP-19, which was a descendant of VIP
3.5 by Masahiko Sato and VIP 4.4 by Aamod Sane.

Emacs Preliminaries
===================

   Emacs can edit several files at once.  A file in Emacs is placed in a
"buffer" that usually has the same name as the file.  Buffers are also
used for other purposes, such as shell interfaces, directory editing,
etc.  *Note Directory Editor: (emacs)Dired, for an example.

   A buffer has a distinguished position called the "point".  A "point"
is always between 2 characters, and is "looking at" the right hand
character.  The cursor is positioned on the right hand character.
Thus, when the "point" is looking at the end-of-line, the cursor is on
the end-of-line character, i.e. beyond the last character on the line.
This is the default Emacs behavior.

   The default settings of Viper try to mimic the behavior of Vi,
preventing the cursor from going beyond the last character on the line.
By using Emacs commands directly (such as those bound to arrow keys),
it is possible to get the cursor beyond the end-of-line.  However, this
won't (or shouldn't) happen if you restrict yourself to standard Vi
keys, unless you modify the default editing style.  *Note
Customization::.

   In addition to the "point", there is another distinguished buffer
position called the "mark".  *Note Mark: (emacs)Mark, for more info on
the mark.  The text between the "point" and the "mark" is called the
"region" of the buffer.  For the Viper user, this simply means that in
addition to the Vi textmarkers a-z, there is another marker called
"mark".  This is similar to the unnamed Vi marker used by the jump
commands ```' and `''', which move the cursor to the position of the
last absolute jump.  Viper provides access to the region in most text
manipulation commands as `r' and `R' suffix to commands that operate on
text regions, e.g., `dr' to delete region, etc.

   Furthermore, Viper lets Ex-style commands to work on the current
region.  This is done by typing a digit argument before `:'.  For
instance, typing `1:' will propmt you with something like _:123,135_,
assuming that the current region starts at line 123 and ends at line
135.  There is no need to type the line numbers, since Viper inserts
them automatically in front of the Ex command.

   *Note Basics::, for more info.

   Emacs divides the screen into tiled "windows".  You can see the
contents of a buffer through the window associated with the buffer.  The
cursor of the screen is positioned on the character after "point".
Every window has a "mode line" that displays information about the
buffer.  You can change the format of the mode line, but normally if
you see `**' at the beginning of a mode line it means that the buffer
is "modified".  If you write out the contents of a buffer to a file,
then the buffer will become not modified.  Also if you see `%%' at the
beginning of the mode line, it means that the file associated with the
buffer is write protected.  The mode line will also show the buffer
name and current major and minor modes (see below).  A special buffer
called "Minibuffer" is displayed as the last line in a Minibuffer
window.  The Minibuffer window is used for command input output.  Viper
uses Minibuffer window for `/' and `:' commands.

   An Emacs buffer can have a "major mode" that customizes Emacs for
editing text of a particular sort by changing the functionality of the
keys.  Keys are defined using a "keymap" that records the bindings
between keystrokes and functions.  The "global keymap" is common to all
the buffers.  Additionally, each buffer has its "local keymap" that
determines the "mode" of the buffer.  If a function is bound to some
key in the local keymap then that function will be executed when you
type the key.  If no function is bound to a key in the local map,
however, the function bound to the key in the global map will be
executed.  *Note Major Modes: (emacs)Major Modes, for more information.

   A buffer can also have a "minor mode".  Minor modes are options that
you can use or not.  A buffer in `text-mode' can have `auto-fill-mode'
as minor mode, which can be turned off or on at any time.  In Emacs, a
minor mode may have it own keymap, which overrides the local keymap
when the minor mode is turned on.  For more information, *note Minor
Modes: (emacs)Minor Modes.

   Viper is implemented as a collection of minor modes.  Different
minor modes are involved when Viper emulates Vi command mode, Vi insert
mode, etc.  You can also turn Viper on and off at any time while in Vi
command mode.  *Note States in Viper::, for more information.

   Emacs uses Control and Meta modifiers.  These are denoted as C and M,
e.g. `^Z' as `C-z' and `Meta-x' as `M-x'.  The Meta key is usually
located on each side of the Space bar; it is used in a manner similar
to the Control key, e.g., `M-x' means typing `x' while holding the Meta
key down.  For keyboards that do not have a Meta key, <ESC> is used as
Meta.  Thus `M-x' is typed as `<ESC> x'.  Viper uses <ESC> to switch
from Insert state to Vi state.  Therefore Viper defines `C-\' as its
Meta key in Vi state.  *Note Vi State::, for more info.

   Emacs is structured as a lisp interpreter around a C core.  Emacs
keys cause lisp functions to be called.  It is possible to call these
functions directly, by typing `M-x function-name'.


File: viper,  Node: Loading Viper,  Next: States in Viper,  Prev: Emacs Preliminaries,  Up: Overview

Loading Viper
=============

   The most common way to load it automatically is to include the
following lines (in the given order!):

     (setq viper-mode t)
     (require 'viper)

in your `~/.emacs' file.  The `.emacs' file is placed in your home
directory and it is be executed every time you invoke Emacs.  This is
the place where all general Emacs customization takes place.  Beginning
with version 20.0, Emacsen have an interactive interface, which
simplifies the job of customization significantly.

   Viper also uses the file `~/.viper' for Viper-specific customization.
If you wish to be in Vi command state whenever this is deemed
appropriate by the author, you can include the following line in your
`.viper':
     (setq viper-always t)

(*Note Vi State::, for the explanation of Vi command state.)

   The location of Viper customization file can be changed by setting
the variable `viper-custom-file-name' in `.emacs' _prior_ to loading
Viper.

   The latest versions of Emacs have an interactive customization
facility, which allows you to (mostly) bypass the use of the `.emacs'
and `.viper' files. You can reach this customization facility from
within Viper's VI state by executing the Ex command `:customize'.

   Once invoked, Viper will arrange to bring up Emacs buffers in Vi
state whenever this makes sense.  *Note Packages that Change Keymaps::,
to find out when forcing Vi command state on a buffer may be
counter-productive.

   Even if your `.emacs' and `.viper' files do not contain any of the
above lines, you can still load Viper and enter Vi command state by
typing the following from within Emacs:

     M-x viper-mode

   When Emacs first comes up, if you have not specified a file on the
command line, it will show the `*scratch*' buffer, in the `Lisp
Interaction' mode.  After you invoke Viper, you can start editing files
by using `:e', `:vi', or `v' commands.  (*Note File and Buffer
Handling::, for more information on `v' and other new commands that, in
many cases, are more convenient than `:e', `:vi', and similar old-style
Vi commands.)

   Finally, if at some point you would want to get de-Viperize your
running copy of Emacs after Viper has been loaded, the command `M-x
viper-go-away' will do it for you.  The function `toggle-viper-mode'
toggles Viperization of Emacs on and off.


File: viper,  Node: States in Viper,  Next: The Minibuffer,  Prev: Loading Viper,  Up: Overview

States in Viper
===============

   Viper has four states, Emacs, Vi, Insert, and Replace.

`Emacs state'
     This is the state plain vanilla Emacs is normally in.  After you
     have loaded Viper, `C-z' will normally take you to Vi command
     state.  Another `C-z' will take you back to Emacs state.  This
     toggle key can be changed, *note Customization:: You can also type
     `M-x viper-mode' to change to Vi state.

     For users who chose to set their user level to 1 at Viper setup
     time, switching to Emacs state is deliberately made harder in
     order to not confuse the novice user.  In this case, `C-z' will
     either iconify Emacs (if Emacs runs as an application under X) or
     it will stop Emacs (if Emacs runs on a dumb terminal or in an
     Xterm window).

`Vi state'
     This is the Vi command mode.  Any of the Vi commands, such as `i,
     o, a', ..., will take you to Insert state.  All Vi commands may be
     used in this mode.  Most Ex commands can also be used.  For a full
     list of Ex commands supported by Viper, type `:' and then <TAB>.
     To get help on any issue, including the Ex commands, type `:help'.
     This will invoke Viper Info (if it is installed).  Then typing
     `i' will prompt you for a topic to search in the index.  Note: to
     search for Ex commands in the index, you should start them with a
     `:', e.g., `:WW'.

     In Viper, Ex commands can be made to work on the current Emacs
     region.  This is done by typing a digit argument before `:'.  For
     instance, typing `1:' will propmt you with something like
     _:123,135_, assuming that the current region starts at line 123 and
     ends at line 135.  There is no need to type the line numbers,
     since Viper inserts them automatically in front of the Ex command.

`Insert state'
     Insert state is the Vi insertion mode.  <ESC> will take you back to
     Vi state.  Insert state editing can be done, including
     auto-indentation.  By default, Viper disables Emacs key bindings
     in Insert state.

`Replace state'
     Commands like `cw' invoke the Replace state.  When you cross the
     boundary of a replacement region (usually designated via a `$'
     sign), it will automatically change to Insert state.  You do not
     have to worry about it.  The key bindings remain practically the
     same as in Insert state.  If you type <ESC>, Viper will switch to
     Vi command mode, terminating the replacement state.

   The modes are indicated on the "mode line" as <E>, <I>, <V>, and <R>,
so that the multiple modes do not confuse you.  Most of your editing
can be done in Vi and Insert states.  Viper will try to make all new
buffers be in Vi state, but sometimes they may come up in Emacs state.
`C-z' will take you to Vi state in such a case.  In some major modes,
like Dired, Info, Gnus, etc., you should not switch to Vi state (and
Viper will not attempt to do so) because these modes are not intended
for text editing and many of the Vi keys have special meaning there.
If you plan to read news, browse directories, read mail, etc., from
Emacs (which you should start doing soon!), you should learn about the
meaning of the various keys in those special modes (typing `C-h m' in a
buffer provides help with key bindings for the major mode of that
buffer).

   If you switch to Vi in Dired or similar modes--no harm is done.  It
is just that the special key bindings provided by those modes will be
temporarily overshadowed by Viper's bindings.  Switching back to
Viper's Emacs state will revive the environment provided by the current
major mode.

   States in Viper are orthogonal to Emacs major modes, such as C mode
or Dired mode.  You can turn Viper on and off for any Emacs state.
When Viper is turned on, Vi state can be used to move around.  In
Insert state, the bindings for these modes can be accessed.  For
beginners (users at Viper levels 1 and 2), these bindings are
suppressed in Insert state, so that new users are not confused by the
Emacs states.  Note that unless you allow Emacs bindings in Insert
state, you cannot do many interesting things, like language sensitive
editing.  For the novice user (at Viper level 1), all major mode
bindings are turned off in Vi state as well.  This includes the
bindings for key sequences that start with `C-c', which practically
means that all major mode bindings are supported.  *Note
Customization::, to find out how to allow Emacs keys in Insert state.

* Menu:

* Emacs State::         This is the state you should learn more about when
                        you get up to speed with Viper.
* Vi State::            Vi commands are executed in this state.
* Insert State::        You can enter text, and also can do sophisticated
                        editing if you know enough Emacs commands.
* Replace State::       Like Insert mode, but it is invoked via the
                        replacement commands, such as cw, C, R, etc.

Emacs State
-----------

   You will be in this mode only by accident (hopefully).  This is the
state Emacs is normally in (imagine!!).  Now leave it as soon as
possible by typing `C-z'.  Then you will be in Vi state (sigh of
relief) :-).

   Emacs state is actually a Viperism to denote all the major and minor
modes (*note Emacs Preliminaries::) other than Viper that Emacs can be
in.  Emacs can have several modes, such as C mode for editing C
programs, LaTeX mode for editing LaTeX documents, Dired for directory
editing, etc.  These are major modes, each with a different set of
key-bindings.  Viper states are orthogonal to these Emacs major modes.
The presence of these language sensitive and other modes is a major win
over Vi.  *Note Improvements over Vi::, for more.

   The bindings for these modes can be made available in the Viper
Insert state as well as in Emacs state.  Unless you specify your user
level as 1 (a novice), all major mode key sequences that start with
`C-x' and `C-c' are also available in Vi state.  This is important
because major modes designed for editing files, such as cc-mode or
latex-mode, use key sequences that begin with `C-x' and `C-c'.

   There is also a key that lets you temporarily escape to Vi command
state from Emacs or Insert states: typing `C-c \' will let you execute a
single Vi command while staying in Viper's Emacs or Insert state.  In
Insert state, the same can also be achieved by typing `C-z'.


File: viper,  Node: Vi State,  Next: Insert State,  Prev: Emacs State,  Up: States in Viper

Vi State
--------

   This is the Vi command mode.  When Viper is in Vi state, you will
see the sign <V> in the mode line.  Most keys will work as in Vi.  The
notable exceptions are:

`C-x'
     `C-x' is used to invoke Emacs commands, mainly those that do window
     management.  `C-x 2' will split a window, `C-x 0' will close a
     window.  `C-x 1' will close all other windows.  `C-xb' is used to
     switch buffers in a window, and `C-xo' to move through windows.
     These are about the only necessary keystrokes.  For the rest, see
     the GNU Emacs Manual.

`C-c'
     For user levels 2 and higher, this key serves as a prefix key for
     the key sequences used by various major modes.  For users at Viper
     level 1, `C-c' simply beeps.

`C-g and C-]'
     These are the Emacs `quit' keys.  There will be cases where you
     will have to use `C-g' to quit.  Similarly, `C-]' is used to exit
     `Recursive Edits' in Emacs for which there is no comparable Vi
     functionality and no key-binding.  Recursive edits are indicated by
     `[]' brackets framing the modes on the mode line.  *Note Recursive
     Edit: (emacs)Recursive Edit.  At user level 1, `C-g' is bound to
     `viper-info-on-file' function instead.

`C-\'
     Viper uses <ESC> as a switch between Insert and Vi states.  Emacs
     uses <ESC> for Meta.  The Meta key is very important in Emacs
     since many functions are accessible only via that key as `M-x
     function-name'.  Therefore, we need to simulate it somehow.  In
     Viper's Vi, Insert, and Replace states, the meta key is set to be
     `C-\'.  Thus, to get `M-x', you should type `C-\ x' (if the
     keyboard has no Meta key).  This works both in the Vi command
     state and in the Insert and Replace states.  In Vi command state,
     you can also use `\ <ESC>' as the meta key.

     Note: Emacs binds `C-\' to a function that offers to change the
     keyboard input method in the multilingual environment.  Viper
     overrides this binding.  However, it is still possible to switch
     the input method by typing `\ C-\' in the Vi command state and
     `C-z \ C-\' in the Insert state.  Or you can use the MULE menu in
     the menubar.

Other differences are mostly improvements.  The ones you should know
about are:

`Undo'
     `u' will undo.  Undo can be repeated by the `.' key.  Undo itself
     can be undone.  Another `u' will change the direction.  The
     presence of repeatable undo means that `U', undoing lines, is not
     very important.  Therefore, `U' also calls `viper-undo'.

`Counts'
     Most commands, `~', `[[', `p', `/', ..., etc., take counts.

`Regexps'
     Viper uses Emacs Regular Expressions for searches.  These are a
     superset of Vi regular expressions, excepting the change-of-case
     escapes `\u', `\L', ..., etc.  *Note Regular Expressions:
     (emacs)Regular Expressions, for details.  Files specified to `:e'
     use `csh' regular expressions (globbing, wildcards, what have you).
     However, the function `viper-toggle-search-style', bound to `C-c
     /', lets the user switch from search with regular expressions to
     plain vanilla search and vice versa.  It also lets one switch from
     case-sensitive search to case-insensitive and back.  *Note Viper
     Specials::, for more details.

`Ex commands'
     The current working directory of a buffer is automatically
     inserted in the minibuffer if you type `:e' then space.  Absolute
     filenames are required less often in Viper.  For file names, Emacs
     uses a convention that is slightly different from other programs.
     It is designed to minimize the need for deleting file names that
     Emacs provides in its prompts.  (This is usually convenient, but
     occasionally the prompt may suggest a wrong file name for you.)
     If you see a prompt `/usr/foo/' and you wish to edit the file
     `~/.viper', you don't have to erase the prompt.  Instead, simply
     continue typing what you need.  Emacs will interpret
     `/usr/foo/~/.viper' correctly.  Similarly, if the prompt is
     `~/foo/' and you need to get to `/bar/file', keep typing.  Emacs
     interprets `~/foo//bar/' as `/bar/file', since when it sees `//',
     it understands that `~/foo/' is to be discarded.

     The command `:cd' will change the default directory for the
     current buffer.  The command `:e' will interpret the filename
     argument in `csh'.  *Note Customization::, if you want to change
     the default shell.  The command `:next' takes counts from `:args',
     so that `:rew' is obsolete.  Also, `:args' will show only the
     invisible files (i.e., those that are not currently seen in Emacs
     windows).

     When applicable, Ex commands support file completion and history.
     This means that by typing a partial file name and then <TAB>,
     Emacs will try to complete the name or it will offer a menu of
     possible completions.  This works similarly to Tcsh and extends
     the behavior of Csh.  While Emacs is waiting for a file name, you
     can type `M-p' to get the previous file name you typed.
     Repeatedly typing `M-p' and `M-n' will let you browse through the
     file history.

     Like file names, partially typed Ex commands can be completed by
     typing <TAB>, and Viper keeps the history of Ex commands.  After
     typing `:', you can browse through the previously entered Ex
     commands by typing `M-p' and `M-n'.  Viper tries to rationalize
     when it puts Ex commands on the history list.  For instance, if
     you typed `:w! foo', only `:w!' will be placed on the history
     list.  This is because the last history element is the default
     that can be invoked simply by typing `: <RET>'.  If `:w! foo' were
     placed on the list, it would be all to easy to override valuable
     data in another file.  Reconstructing the full command, `:w! foo',
     from the history is still not that hard, since Viper has a
     separate history for file names.  By typing `: M-p', you will get
     `:w!' in the Minibuffer.  Then, repeated `M-p' will get you through
     the file history, inserting one file name after another.

     In contrast to `:w! foo', if the command were `:r foo', the entire
     command will appear in the history list.  This is because having
     `:r' alone as a default is meaningless, since this command
     requires a file argument.

As Vi, Viper's destructive commands can be re-executed by typing ``.''.
However, in addition, Viper keeps track of the history of such
commands.  This history can be perused by typing `C-c M-p' and `C-c
M-n'.  Having found the appropriate command, it can be then executed by
typing ``.''.  *Note Improvements over Vi::, for more information.

Insert State
------------

   To avoid confusing the beginner (at Viper level 1 and 2), Viper
makes only the standard Vi keys available in Insert state.  The
implication is that Emacs major modes cannot be used in Insert state.
It is strongly recommended that as soon as you are comfortable, make the
Emacs state bindings visible (by changing your user level to 3 or
higher).  *Note Customization::, to see how to do this.

   Once this is done, it is possible to do quite a bit of editing in
Insert state.  For instance, Emacs has a "yank" command, `C-y', which
is similar to Vi's `p'.  However, unlike `p', `C-y' can be used in
Insert state of Viper.  Emacs also has a kill ring where it keeps
pieces of text you deleted while editing buffers.  The command `M-y' is
used to delete the text previously put back by Emacs' `C-y' or by Vi's
`p' command and reinsert text that was placed on the kill-ring earlier.

   This works both in Vi and Insert states.  In Vi state, `M-y' is a
much better alternative to the usual Vi's way of recovering the 10
previously deleted chunks of text.  In Insert state, you can use this
as follows.  Suppose you deleted a piece of text and now you need to
re-insert it while editing in Insert mode.  The key `C-y' will put back
the most recently deleted chunk.  If this is not what you want, type
`M-y' repeatedly and, hopefully, you will find the chunk you want.

   Finally, in Insert and Replace states, Viper provides the history of
pieces of text inserted in previous insert or replace commands.  These
strings of text can be recovered by repeatedly typing `C-c M-p' or `C-c
M-n' while in Insert or Replace state.  (This feature is disabled in
the minibuffer: the above keys are usually bound to other histories,
which are more appropriate in the minibuffer.)

   You can call Meta functions from Insert state.  As in Vi state, the
Meta key is `C-\'.  Thus `M-x' is typed as `C-\ x'.

   Other Emacs commands that are useful in Insert state are `C-e' and
`C-a', which move the cursor to the end and the beginning of the
current line, respectively.  You can also use `M-f' and `M-b', which
move the cursor forward (or backward) one word.  If your display has a
Meta key, these functions are invoked by holding the Meta key and then
typing `f' and `b', respectively.  On displays without the Meta key,
these functions are invoked by typing `C-\ f' and `C-\ b' (`C-\'
simulates the Meta key in Insert state, as explained above).

   The key `C-z' is sometimes also useful in Insert state: it allows you
to execute a single command in Vi state without leaving the Insert
state!  For instance, `C-z d2w' will delete the next two words without
leaving the Insert state.

   When Viper is in Insert state, you will see <I> in the mode line.


File: viper,  Node: Replace State,  Prev: Insert State,  Up: States in Viper

Replace State
-------------

   This state is entered through Vi replacement commands, such as `C',
`cw', etc., or by typing `R'.  In Replace state, Viper puts <R> in the
mode line to let you know which state is in effect.  If Replace state is
entered through `R', Viper stays in that state until the user hits
<ESC>.  If this state is entered via the other replacement commands,
then Replace state is in effect until you hit <ESC> or until you cross
the rightmost boundary of the replacement region.  In the latter case,
Viper changes its state from Replace to Insert (which you will notice
by the change in the mode line).

   Since Viper runs under Emacs, it is possible to switch between
buffers while in Replace state.  You can also move the cursor using the
arrow keys (even on dumb terminals!) and the mouse.  Because of this
freedom (which is unattainable in regular Vi), it is possible to take
the cursor outside the replacement region.  (This may be necessary for
several reasons, including the need to enable text selection and
region-setting with the mouse.)

   The issue then arises as to what to do when the user hits the <ESC>
key.  In Vi, this would cause the text between cursor and the end of
the replacement region to be deleted.  But what if, as is possible in
Viper, the cursor is not inside the replacement region?

   To solve the problem, Viper keeps track of the last cursor position
while it was still inside the replacement region.  So, in the above
situation, Viper would delete text between this position and the end of
the replacement region.

The Minibuffer
==============

   The Minibuffer is where commands are entered in.  Editing can be done
by commands from Insert state, namely:

`C-h'
     Backspace

`C-w'
     Delete Word

`C-u'
     Erase line

`C-v'
     Quote the following character

`<RET>'
     Execute command

`C-g and C-]'
     Emacs quit and abort keys.  These may be necessary.  *Note Vi
     State::, for an explanation.

`M-p and M-n'
     These keys are bound to functions that peruse minibuffer history.
     The precise history to be perused depends on the context.  It may
     be the history of search strings, Ex commands, file names, etc.

   Most of the Emacs keys are functional in the Minibuffer.  While in
the Minibuffer, Viper tries to make editing resemble Vi's behavior when
the latter is waiting for the user to type an Ex command.  In
particular, you can use the regular Vi commands to edit the Minibuffer.
You can switch between the Vi state and Insert state at will, and even
use the replace mode.  Initially, the Minibuffer comes up in Insert
state.

   Some users prefer plain Emacs bindings in the Minibuffer.  To this
end, set `viper-vi-style-in-minibuffer' to `nil' in `.viper'.  *Note
Customization::, to learn how to do this.

   When the Minibuffer changes Viper states, you will notice that the
appearance of the text there changes as well.  This is useful because
the Minibuffer has no mode line to tell which Vi state it is in.  The
appearance of the text in the Minibuffer can be changed.  *Note Viper
Specials::, for more details.

Multiple Files in Viper
=======================

   Viper can edit multiple files.  This means, for example that you
never need to suffer through `No write since last change' errors.  Some
Viper elements are common over all the files.

`Textmarkers'
     Textmarkers remember _files and positions_.  If you set marker `a'
     in file `foo', start editing file `bar' and type `'a', then _YOU
     WILL SWITCH TO FILE `foo'_.  You can see the contents of a
     textmarker using the Viper command `[<a-z>' where <a-z> are the
     textmarkers, e.g., `[a' to view marker `a' .

`Repeated Commands'
     Command repetitions are common over files.  Typing `!!' will
     repeat the last `!' command whichever file it was issued from.
     Typing `.' will repeat the last command from any file, and
     searches will repeat the last search.  Ex commands can be repeated
     by typing `: <RET>'.  Note: in some rare cases, that `: <RET>' may
     do something dangerous.  However, usually its effect can be undone
     by typing `u'.

`Registers'
     Registers are common to files.  Also, text yanked with `y' can be
     put back (`p') into any file.  The Viper command `]<a-z>', where
     <a-z> are the registers, can be used to look at the contents of a
     register, e.g., type `]a' to view register `a'.

     There is one difference in text deletion that you should be aware
     of.  This difference comes from Emacs and was adopted in Viper
     because we find it very useful.  In Vi, if you delete a line, say,
     and then another line, these two deletions are separated and are
     put back separately if you use the `p' command.  In Emacs (and
     Viper), successive series of deletions that are _not interrupted_
     by other commands are lumped together, so the deleted text gets
     accumulated and can be put back as one chunk.  If you want to
     break a sequence of deletions so that the newly deleted text could
     be put back separately from the previously deleted text, you
     should perform a non-deleting action, e.g., move the cursor one
     character in any direction.

`Absolute Filenames'
     The current directory name for a file is automatically prepended
     to the file name in any `:e', `:r', `:w', etc., command (in Emacs,
     each buffer has a current directory).  This directory is inserted
     in the Minibuffer once you type space after `:e, r', etc.  Viper
     also supports completion of file names and Ex commands (<TAB>),
     and it keeps track of command and file history (`M-p', `M-n').
     Absolute filenames are required less often in Viper.

     You should be aware that Emacs interprets `/foo/bar//bla' as
     `/bla' and `/foo/~/bar' as `~/bar'.  This is designed to minimize
     the need for erasing file names that Emacs suggests in its
     prompts, if a suggested file name is not what you wanted.

     The command `:cd' will change the default directory for the
     current Emacs buffer.  The Ex command `:e' will interpret the
     filename argument in `csh', by default.  *Note Customization::, if
     you want to change this.

Currently undisplayed files can be listed using the `:ar' command.  The
command `:n' can be given counts from the `:ar' list to switch to other
files.

Unimplemented Features
======================

   Unimplemented features include:

   * `:ab' and `:una' are not implemented.  Both `:map' and `:ab' are
     considered obsolete, since Emacs has much more powerful facilities
     for defining keyboard macros and abbreviations.

   * `:set option?' is not implemented.  The current `:set' can also be
     used to set Emacs variables.

   * `:se list' requires modification of the display code for Emacs, so
     it is not implemented.  A useful alternative is `cat -t -e file'.
     Unfortunately, it cannot be used directly inside Emacs, since
     Emacs will obdurately change `^I' back to normal tabs.

Basics
======

   The Vi command set is based on the idea of combining motion commands
with other commands.  The motion command is used as a text region
specifier for other commands.  We classify motion commands into "point
commands" and "line commands".

   The point commands are:

     `h', `l', `0',  `$', `w', `W', `b', `B', `e', `E', `(', `)', `/',
     `?', ``', `f', `F', `t', `T', `%', `;', `,', `^'

   The line commands are:

     `j', `k', `+', `-', `H', `M', `L', `{', `}', `G', `'',  `[[',
     `]]', `[]'

If a point command is given as an argument to a modifying command, the
region determined by the point command will be affected by the modifying
command.  On the other hand, if a line command is given as an argument
to a modifying command, the region determined by the line command will
be enlarged so that it will become the smallest region properly
containing the region and consisting of whole lines (we call this
process "expanding the region"), and then the enlarged region will be
affected by the modifying command.  Text Deletion Commands (*note
Deleting Text::), Change commands (*note Changing Text::), even Shell
Commands (*note Shell Commands::) use these commands to describe a
region of text to operate on.  Thus, type `dw' to delete a word, `>}'
to shift a paragraph, or `!'afmt' to format a region from `point' to
textmarker `a'.

   Viper adds the region specifiers `r' and `R'.  Emacs has a special
marker called "mark".  The text-area between the current cursor
position "point" and the "mark" is called the "region".  `r' specifies
the raw region and `R' is the expanded region (i.e., the minimal
contiguous chunk of full lines that contains the raw region).  `dr'
will now delete the region, `>r' will shift it, etc.  `r,R' are not
motion commands, however.  The special mark is set by `m.' and other
commands.  *Note Marking::, for more info.

   Viper also adds counts to most commands for which it would make
sense.

   In the Overview chapter, some Multiple File issues were discussed
(*note Multiple Files in Viper::).  In addition to the files, Emacs has
buffers.  These can be seen in the `:args' list and switched using
`:next' if you type `:set ex-cycle-through-non-files t', or specify
`(setq ex-cycle-through-non-files t)' in your `.viper' file.  *Note
Customization::, for details.


File: viper,  Node: Undo and Backups,  Next: History,  Prev: Basics,  Up: Improvements over Vi

Undo and Backups
================

   Viper provides multiple undo.  The number of undo's and the size is
limited by the machine.  The Viper command `u' does an undo.  Undo can
be repeated by typing `.' (a period).  Another `u' will undo the undo,
and further `.' will repeat it.  Typing `u' does the first undo, and
changes the direction.

   Since the undo size is limited, Viper can create backup files and
auto-save files.  It will normally do this automatically.  It is
possible to have numbered backups, etc.  For details, *note Backup and
Auto-Save: (emacs)Backup.

   The results of the 9 previous changes are available in the 9 numeric
registers, as in Vi.  The extra goody is the ability to _view_ these
registers, in addition to being able to access them through `p' and
`M-y' (*Note Insert State::, for details.)  The Viper command `]
register' will display the contents of any register, numeric or
alphabetical.  The related command `[ textmarker' will show the text
around the textmarker.  `register' and `textmarker' can be any letters
from a through z.


File: viper,  Node: History,  Next: Macros and Registers,  Prev: Undo and Backups,  Up: Improvements over Vi

History
=======

   History is provided for Ex commands, Vi searches, file names, pieces
of text inserted in earlier commands that use Insert or Replace state,
and for destructive commands in Vi state.  These are useful for fixing
those small typos that screw up searches and `:s', and for eliminating
routine associated with repeated typing of file names or pieces of text
that need to be inserted frequently.  At the `:' or `/' prompts in the
Minibuffer, you can do the following:

`M-p and M-n'
     To move to previous and next history items.  This causes the
     history items to appear on the command line, where you can edit
     them, or simply type Return to execute.

`M-r and M-s'
     To search backward and forward through the history.

`<RET>'
     Type <RET> to accept a default (which is displayed in the prompt).

   The history of insertions  can be perused by typing `C-c M-p' and
`C-c M-n' while in Insert or Replace state.  The history of destructive
Vi commands can be perused via the same keys when Viper is in Vi state.
*Note Viper Specials::, for details.

   All Ex commands have a file history.  For instance, typing `:e',
space and then `M-p' will bring up the name of the previously typed file
name.  Repeatedly typing `M-p', `M-n', etc., will let you browse
through the file history.

   Similarly, commands that have to do with switching buffers have a
buffer history, and commands that expect strings or regular expressions
keep a history on those items.


File: viper,  Node: Macros and Registers,  Next: Completion,  Prev: History,  Up: Improvements over Vi

Macros and Registers
====================

   Viper facilitates the use of Emacs-style keyboard macros.  `@#' will
start a macro definition.  As you type, the commands will be executed,
and remembered (This is called "learn mode" in some editors.)
`@register' will complete the macro, putting it into `register', where
`register' is any character from `a' through `z'.  Then you can execute
this macro using `@register'.  It is, of course, possible to yank some
text into a register and execute it using `@register'.  Typing `@@',
`@RET', or `@C-j' will execute the last macro that was executed using
`@register'.

   Viper will automatically lowercase the register, so that pressing the
`SHIFT' key for `@' will not create problems.  This is for `@' macros
and `"p' _only_.  In the case of `y', `"Ayy' will append to _register
a_.  For `[,],',`', it is an error to use a Uppercase register name.

   The contents of a register can be seen by `]register'.
(`[textmarker' will show the contents of a textmarker).

   The last keyboard macro can also be executed using `*', and it can
be yanked into a register using `@!register'.  This is useful for Emacs
style keyboard macros defined using `C-x(' and `C-x)'.  Emacs keyboard
macros have more capabilities.  *Note Keyboard Macros: (emacs)Keyboard
Macros, for details.

   Keyboard Macros allow an interesting form of Query-Replace:
`/pattern' or `n' to go to the next pattern (the query), followed by a
Keyboard Macro execution `@@' (the replace).

   Viper also provides Vi-style macros.  *Note Vi Macros::, for details.


File: viper,  Node: Completion,  Next: Improved Search,  Prev: Macros and Registers,  Up: Improvements over Vi

Completion
==========

   Completion is done when you type <TAB>.  The Emacs completer does not
grok wildcards in file names.  Once you type a wildcard, the completer
will no longer work for that file name.  Remember that Emacs interprets
a file name of the form `/foo//bar' as `/bar' and `/foo/~/bar' as
`~/bar'.


File: viper,  Node: Improved Search,  Next: Abbreviation Facilities,  Prev: Completion,  Up: Improvements over Vi

Improved Search
===============

   Viper provides buffer search, the ability to search the buffer for a
region under the cursor.  You have to turn this on in `.viper' either
by calling

     (viper-buffer-search-enable)

or by setting `viper-buffer-search-char' to, say, `f3':
     (setq viper-buffer-search-char ?g)

If the user calls `viper-buffer-search-enable' explicitly (the first
method), then `viper-buffer-search-char' will be set to `g'.
Regardless of how this feature is enabled, the key
`viper-buffer-search-char' will take movement commands, like `w,/,e',
to find a region and then search for the contents of that region.  This
command is very useful for searching for variable names, etc., in a
program.  The search can be repeated by `n' or reversed by `N'.

   Emacs provides incremental search.  As you type the string in, the
cursor will move to the next match.  You can snarf words from the buffer
as you go along.  Incremental Search is normally bound to `C-s' and
`C-r'.  *Note Customization::, to find out how to change the bindings
of `C-r or C-s'.  For details, *note Incremental Search:
(emacs)Incremental Search.

   Viper also provides a query replace function that prompts through the
Minibuffer.  It is invoked by the `Q' key in Vi state.

   On a window display, Viper supports mouse search, i.e., you can
search for a word by clicking on it.  *Note Viper Specials::, for
details.

   Finally, on a window display, Viper highlights search patterns as it
finds them.  This is done through what is known as _faces_ in Emacs.
The variable that controls how search patterns are highlighted is
`viper-search-face'.  If you don't want any highlighting at all, put
     (copy-face 'default 'viper-search-face)

in `~/.viper'.  If you want to change how patterns are highlighted, you
will have to change `viper-search-face' to your liking.  The easiest
way to do this is to use Emacs customization widget, which is accessible
from the menubar.  Viper customization group is located under the
_Emulations_ customization group, which in turn is under the _Editing_
group.  All Viper faces are grouped together under Viper's
_Highlighting_ group.

   Try it: it is really simple!


File: viper,  Node: Abbreviation Facilities,  Next: Movement and Markers,  Prev: Improved Search,  Up: Improvements over Vi

Abbreviation Facilities
=======================

   It is possible in Emacs to define abbrevs based on the contents of
the buffer.  Sophisticated templates can be defined using the Emacs
abbreviation facilities.  *Note Abbreviations: (emacs)Abbrevs, for
details.

   Emacs also provides Dynamic Abbreviations.  Given a partial word,
Emacs will search the buffer to find an extension for this word.  For
instance, one can type `Abbreviations' by typing `A', followed by a
keystroke that completed the `A' to `Abbreviations'.  Repeated typing
will search further back in the buffer, so that one could get `Abbrevs'
by repeating the keystroke, which appears earlier in the text.  Emacs
binds this to `<ESC> /', so you will have to find a key and bind the
function `dabbrev-expand' to that key.  Facilities like this make Vi's
`:ab' command obsolete.
