Code provided per Radar #3066897 to fix bug #2937515.

The Unicode decomposition used to date for HFS+ volumes - as described in
  <http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn1150.html#CanonicalDecomposition>
  <http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn1150table.html>
- is based on a modified version of the decomposition rules for Unicode 2.1.2
(but even those were not correctly implemented for certain combinations of
multiple combining marks). Unicode has updated the decomposition and combining
mark reordering rules and data many times since then, but they have locked them
down for Unicode 3.1. This is because Unicode 3.1 is the basis of the Unicode
normalization forms such as NFC and NFD. We began supporting these normalization
formats in Jaguar.

Because of this, the Apple Unicode cross-functional committee decided to do a
one-time change to update the decomposition rules used for HFS+ volumes from the
Unicode 2.1.2 rules to the Unicode 3.1 rules. TEC and the kernel encoding
converters made this change in Jaguar. One other piece that was supposed to
happen was an enhancement to fsck to convert filenames on HFS+ volumes from the
old decomposition to the new.

That fsck change did not happen in Jaguar, and as a result there are bugs such
as 2937515 (in which users are seeing partial garbage for filenames). The update
affects the decomposition of Greek characters - about 80 of them (18 of which
correspond to characters in MacGreek). It also affects the decomposition of a
few others: around 23 Latin-script characters and 18 Cyrillic characters (none
of which correspond to anything in a traditional Mac encoding), 8 Arabic
characters (5 of which do correspond to MacArabic characters), 16 Indic, Thai, &
Lao characters (3 of which correspond to characters in Mac encodings). It also
potentially affects the ordering of all combining marks.

This directory contains code provided per 3066897 that fsck can use to address
this problem for HFS+ volumes.

----
A. Data structure

The data is organized into a two-level trie. The first level is a table that
maps the high-order 12 bits of a UniChar to an index value. The value is -1 if
no character with those high 12 bits has either a decomposition update or a
nonzero combining class; otherwise, it is an index into an array of ranges that
map the low 4 bits of the UniChar to the necessary data. There are two such
arrays of ranges; one provides the mappings to combining class values, the other
provides the mappings to decomposition update information. The latter is in the
form of an index into an array of sequences that contain an action code, an
optional list of additional characters that need to be matched for a complete
sequence match (in the case where a 2-element or 3-element sequence needs to be
updated), and the replacement decomposition sequence.

There is one additional twist for the first-level trie table. Since the
characters that have classor decomposition data are all either in the range
0x0000-30FF or 0xFB00-FFFF, we can save 3K space in the table by eliminating the
middle. Before looking up a UTF16 character in the table, we first add 0x0500 to
it; the resulting shifted UniChar is in the range 0x0000-35FF. So if the shifted
UniChar is >= 0x3600, we don't bother looking in the table.

The table data is generated automatically by the fsckMakeDecompData tool; the
sources for this tool contain an array with the raw data for characters that
either have nonzero combining class or begin a sequence of characters that may
need to be updated. The tool generates the index, the two range arrays, and the
list of decomposition update actions.

----
B. Files

* fsckDecompDataEnums.h contains enums related to the data tables

* fsckMakeDecompData.c contains the raw data source; when this tool is compiled
and run, it writes to standard output the contents of the binary data tables;
this should be directed into a file fsckDecompData.h.

* fsckFixDecomps.h contains the interface for the fsckFixDecomps function (and
related types)

* fsckFixDecomps.c contains the function code.

----
C. Function interface

The basic interface (defined in fsckFixDecomps.h) is:

Boolean fsckFixDecomps(	ConstHFSUniStr255Param inFilename, HFSUniStr255
*outFilename );

If inFilename needs updating and the function was able to do this without
overflowing the 255-character limit, it returns 1 (true) and outFIlename
contains the update file. If inFilename did not need updating, or an update
would overflow the limit, the function returns 0 (false) and the contents of
outFilename are undefined.

The function needs a couple of types from Apple interface files (not standard C
ones): HFSUniStr255 and Boolean. For now these are defined in fsckFixDecomps.h
if NO_APPLE_INCLUDES is 1. For building with fsck_hfs, the appropriate includes
should be put into fsckFixDecomps.h.

For the record, hfs_format.h defines HFSUniStr255 as follows:

struct HFSUniStr255 {
	u_int16_t	length;			/* number of unicode characters */
	u_int16_t	unicode[255];	/* unicode characters */
};
typedef struct HFSUniStr255 HFSUniStr255;
typedef const HFSUniStr255 *ConstHFSUniStr255Param;

----
D. Function implementation

Characters that don't require any special handling have combining class 0 and do
not begin a decomposition sequence (of 1-3 characters) that needs updating. For
these characters, the function just copies them from inFilename to outFilename
and sets the pointer outNameCombSeqPtr to NULL (when this pointer is not NULL,
it points to the beginning of a sequence of combining marks that continues up to
the current character; if the current character is combining, it may need to be
reordered into that sequence). The copying operation in cheap, and postponing it
until we know the filename needs modification would make the code much more
complicated.

This copying operation may be invoked from many places in the code, some deeply
nested - any time the code determines that the current character needs no
special handling. For this reason it has a label (CopyBaseChar) and is located
at the end of the character processing loop; various places in the code use goto
statements to jump to it (this is a situation where they are justified).

The main function loop has 4 sections.

First, it quickly determines if the high 12 bits of the character indicate that
it is in a range that has neither nonzero combining class nor any decomposition
sequences that need updating. If so, the code jumps straight to CopyBaseChar.

Second, the code determines if the character is part of a sequence that needs
updating. It checks if the current character has a corresponding action in the
replaceData array. If so, depending on the action, it may need to check for
additional matching characters in inFilename. If the sequence of 1-3 characters
is successfully matched, then a replacement sequence of 1-3 characters is
inserted at the corresponding position in outFilename. While this replacement
sequence is being inserted, each character must be checked to see if it has
nonzero combining class and needs reordering (some replacement sequences consist
entirely of combining characters and may interact with combining characters in
the filename before the updated sequence).

Third, the code handles characters whose high-order 12 bits indicated that some
action was required, but were not part of sequences that needed updating (these
may include characters that were examined in the second part but were part of
sequences that did not completely match, so there are also goto fallthroughs to
this code - labeled CheckCombClass - from the second part). These characters
have to be checked for nonzero combining class; if so, they are reordered as
necessary. Each time a new nonzero class character is encountered, it is added
to outFIlename at the correct point in any active combining character sequence
(with other characters in the sequence moved as necessary), so the sequence
pointed to by outNameCombSeqPtr is always in correct order up to the current
character.

Finally, the fourth part has the default handlers to just copy characters to
outFilename.
