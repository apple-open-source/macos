0. Release history
==================

2007-01-04	v1.0  ready for release
2007-02-18	v1.1  mention 6.3.7 that fixes two regressions


1. Background
=============

fetchmail is a software package to retrieve mail from remote POP2, POP3,
IMAP, ETRN or ODMR servers and forward it to local SMTP, LMTP servers or
message delivery agents.

fetchmail ships with a graphical, Python/Tkinter based configuration
utility named "fetchmailconf" to help the user create configuration (run
control) files for fetchmail.


2. Problem description and Impact
=================================

Fetchmail has had several nasty password disclosure vulnerabilities for
a long time. It was only recently that these have been found.

V1. sslcertck/sslfingerprint options should have implied "sslproto tls1"
    in order to enforce TLS negotiation, but did not.

V2. Even with "sslproto tls1" in the config, fetches would go ahead
    in plain text if STLS/STARTTLS wasn't available (not advertised,
    or advertised but rejected).

V3. POP3 fetches could completely ignore all TLS options whether
    available or not because it didn't reliably issue CAPA before
    checking for STLS support - but CAPA is a requisite for STLS.
    Whether or not CAPAbilities were probed, depended on the "auth"
    option. (Fetchmail only tried CAPA if the auth option was not set at
    all, was set to gssapi, kerberos, kerberos_v4, otp, or cram-md5.)

V4. POP3 could fall back to using plain text passwords, even if strong
    authentication had been configured.

V5. POP2 would not complain if strong authentication or TLS had been
    requested.

This can cause eavesdroppers to obtain the password, depending on the
authentication scheme that is configured or auto-selected, and
subsequently impersonate somebody else when logging into the upstream
server.


3. Workaround
=============

If your upstream offers SSLv3-wrapped service on a dedicated port,
use   fetchmail --ssl --sslcertck --sslproto ssl3   on the command line,
or equivalent in the run control file.  This encrypts the whole session.


4. Solution
===========

  The earlier recommendation to install 6.3.6 is hereby updated, since
  version 6.3.6 introduced two new regressions fixed in 6.3.7: one broke
  KPOP altogether and one broke the automatic POP3 retries without TLS
  if a server advertised TLS but then closed the connection and TLS
  wasn't enforced.

Download and install fetchmail 6.3.7 or a newer stable release from
fetchmail's project site at
<http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1824>.


5. Acknowledgments
==================

Isaac Wilcox has been a great help with testing the fixes and getting
them right.
