0. Release history
==================

2006-11-19 -	internal review draft
2007-01-04 1.0	 ready for release


1. Background
=============

fetchmail is a software package to retrieve mail from remote POP2, POP3,
IMAP, ETRN or ODMR servers and forward it to local SMTP, LMTP servers or
message delivery agents.

fetchmail ships with a graphical, Python/Tkinter based configuration
utility named "fetchmailconf" to help the user create configuration (run
control) files for fetchmail.


2. Problem description and Impact
=================================

Fetchmail 6.3.5 and early 6.3.6 release candidates, when delivering
messages to a message delivery agent by means of the "mda" option, can
crash (by passing a NULL pointer to ferror() and fflush()) when refusing
a message. SMTP and LMTP delivery modes aren't affected.


3. Workaround
=============

Avoid the mda option and ship to a local SMTP or LMTP server instead.


4. Solution
===========

Download and install fetchmail 6.3.6 or a newer stable release from
fetchmail's project site at
<http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1824>.
