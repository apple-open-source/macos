history options
---------------

   Several options (shown above as `-report')  control  what kind of
report is generated:

`-c'
     Report on each time commit was used (i.e., each time the
     repository was modified).

`-e'
     Everything (all record types).  Equivalent to specifying `-x' with
     all record types.  Of course, `-e' will also include record types
     which are added in a future version of CVS; if you are writing a
     script which can only handle certain record types, you'll want to
     specify `-x'.

`-m MODULE'
     Report on a particular module.  (You can meaningfully use `-m'
     more than once on the command line.)

`-o'
     Report on checked-out modules.  This is the default report type.

`-T'
     Report on all tags.

`-x TYPE'
     Extract a particular set of record types TYPE from the CVS
     history.  The types are indicated by single letters, which you may
     specify in combination.

     Certain commands have a single record type:

    `F'
          release

    `O'
          checkout

    `E'
          export

    `T'
          rtag

     One of five record types may result from an update:

    `C'
          A merge was necessary but collisions were detected (requiring
          manual merging).

    `G'
          A merge was necessary and it succeeded.

    `U'
          A working file was copied from the repository.

    `P'
          A working file was patched to match the repository.

    `W'
          The working copy of a file was deleted during update (because
          it was gone from the repository).

     One of three record types results from commit:

    `A'
          A file was added for the first time.

    `M'
          A file was modified.

    `R'
          A file was removed.

   The options shown as `-flags' constrain or expand the report without
requiring option arguments:

`-a'
     Show data for all users (the default is to show data only for the
     user executing `history').

`-l'
     Show last modification only.

`-w'
     Show only the records for modifications done from the same working
     directory where `history' is executing.

   The options shown as `-options ARGS' constrain the report based on
an argument:

`-b STR'
     Show data back to a record containing  the  string STR  in  either
     the module name, the file name, or the repository path.

`-D DATE'
     Show data since DATE.  This is slightly different from the normal
     use of `-D DATE', which selects the newest revision older than
     DATE.

`-f FILE'
     Show data for a particular file (you can specify several `-f'
     options on the same command line).  This is equivalent to
     specifying the file on the command line.

`-n MODULE'
     Show data for a particular module (you can specify several `-n'
     options on the same command line).

`-p REPOSITORY'
     Show data for a particular source repository  (you can specify
     several `-p' options on the same command line).

`-r REV'
     Show records referring to revisions since the revision or tag
     named REV appears in individual RCS files.  Each RCS file is
     searched for the revision or tag.

`-t TAG'
     Show records since tag TAG was last added to the history file.
     This differs from the `-r' flag above in that it reads only the
     history file, not the RCS files, and is much faster.

`-u NAME'
     Show records for user NAME.

`-z TIMEZONE'
     Show times in the selected records using the specified time zone
     instead of UTC.

import--Import sources into CVS, using vendor branches
======================================================

   * Synopsis: import [-options] repository vendortag releasetag...

   * Requires: Repository, source distribution directory.

   * Changes: repository.

   Use `import' to incorporate an entire source distribution from an
outside source (e.g., a source vendor) into your source repository
directory.  You can use this command both for initial creation of a
repository, and for wholesale updates to the module from the outside
source.  *Note Tracking sources::, for a discussion on this subject.

   The REPOSITORY argument gives a directory name (or a path to a
directory) under the CVS root directory for repositories; if the
directory did not exist, import creates it.

   When you use import for updates to source that has been modified in
your source repository (since a prior import), it will notify you of
any files that conflict in the two branches of development; use
`checkout -j' to reconcile the differences, as import instructs you to
do.

   If CVS decides a file should be ignored (*note cvsignore::), it does
not import it and prints `I ' followed by the filename (*note import
output::, for a complete description of the output).

   If the file `$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvswrappers' exists, any file whose
names match the specifications in that file will be treated as packages
and the appropriate filtering will be performed on the file/directory
before being imported.  *Note Wrappers::.

   The outside source is saved in a first-level branch, by default
1.1.1.  Updates are leaves of this branch; for example, files from the
first imported collection of source will be revision 1.1.1.1, then
files from the first imported update will be revision 1.1.1.2, and so
on.

   At least three arguments are required.  REPOSITORY is needed to
identify the collection of source.  VENDORTAG is a tag for the entire
branch (e.g., for 1.1.1).  You must also specify at least one
RELEASETAG to uniquely identify the files at the leaves created each
time you execute `import'.  The RELEASETAG should be new, not
previously existing in the repository file, and uniquely identify the
imported release,

   Note that `import' does _not_ change the directory in which you
invoke it.  In particular, it does not set up that directory as a CVS
working directory; if you want to work with the sources import them
first and then check them out into a different directory (*note Getting
the source::).

* import options::              import options

import options
--------------

   This standard option is supported by `import' (*note Common
options::, for a complete description):

`-m MESSAGE'
     Use MESSAGE as log information, instead of invoking an editor.

   There are the following additional special options.

`-b BRANCH'
     See *Note Multiple vendor branches::.

`-k SUBST'
     Indicate the keyword expansion mode desired.  This setting will
     apply to all files created during the import, but not to any files
     that previously existed in the repository.  See *Note Substitution
     modes::, for a list of valid `-k' settings.

`-I NAME'
     Specify file names that should be ignored during import.  You can
     use this option repeatedly.  To avoid ignoring any files at all
     (even those ignored by default), specify `-I !'.

     NAME can be a file name pattern of the same type that you can
     specify in the `.cvsignore' file.  *Note cvsignore::.

`-W SPEC'
     Specify file names that should be filtered during import.  You can
     use this option repeatedly.

     SPEC can be a file name pattern of the same type that you can
     specify in the `.cvswrappers' file. *Note Wrappers::.


File: cvs.info,  Node: import output,  Next: import examples,  Prev: import options,  Up: import

import output
-------------

   `import' keeps you informed of its progress by printing a line for
each file, preceded by one character indicating the status of the file:

`U FILE'
     The file already exists in the repository and has not been locally
     modified; a new revision has been created (if necessary).

`N FILE'
     The file is a new file which has been added to the repository.

`C FILE'
     The file already exists in the repository but has been locally
     modified; you will have to merge the changes.

`I FILE'
     The file is being ignored (*note cvsignore::).

`L FILE'
     The file is a symbolic link; `cvs import' ignores symbolic links.
     People periodically suggest that this behavior should be changed,
     but if there is a consensus on what it should be changed to, it
     doesn't seem to be apparent.  (Various options in the `modules'
     file can be used to recreate symbolic links on checkout, update,
     etc.; *note modules::.)

log--Print out log information for files
========================================

   * Synopsis: log [options] [files...]

   * Requires: repository, working directory.

   * Changes: nothing.

   Display log information for files.  `log' used to call the RCS
utility `rlog'.  Although this is no longer true in the current
sources, this history determines the format of the output and the
options, which are not quite in the style of the other CVS commands.

   The output includes the location of the RCS file, the "head"
revision (the latest revision on the trunk), all symbolic names (tags)
and some other things.  For each revision, the revision number, the
author, the number of lines added/deleted and the log message are
printed.  All times are displayed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
(Other parts of CVS print times in the local timezone).

   *Note: `log' uses `-R' in a way that conflicts with the normal use
inside CVS (*note Common options::).*

* Menu:

File: cvs.info,  Node: log options,  Next: log examples,  Up: log

log options
-----------

   By default, `log' prints all information that is available.  All
other options restrict the output.

`-b'
     Print information about the revisions on the default branch,
     normally the highest branch on the trunk.

`-d DATES'
     Print information about revisions with a checkin date/time in the
     range given by the semicolon-separated list of dates.  The date
     formats accepted are those accepted by the `-D' option to many
     other CVS commands (*note Common options::).  Dates can be
     combined into ranges as follows:

    `D1<D2'
    `D2>D1'
          Select the revisions that were deposited between D1 and D2.

    `<D'
    `D>'
          Select all revisions dated D or earlier.

    `D<'
    `>D'
          Select all revisions dated D or later.

    `D'
          Select the single, latest revision dated D or earlier.

     The `>' or `<' characters may be followed by `=' to indicate an
     inclusive range rather than an exclusive one.

     Note that the separator is a semicolon (;).

`-h'
     Print only the name of the RCS file, name of the file in the
     working directory, head, default branch, access list, locks,
     symbolic names, and suffix.

`-l'
     Local; run only in current working directory.  (Default is to run
     recursively).

`-N'
     Do not print the list of tags for this file.  This option can be
     very useful when your site uses a lot of tags, so rather than
     "more"'ing over 3 pages of tag information, the log information is
     presented without tags at all.

`-R'
     Print only the name of the RCS file.

`-rREVISIONS'
     Print information about revisions given in the comma-separated
     list REVISIONS of revisions and ranges.  The following table
     explains the available range formats:

    `REV1:REV2'
          Revisions REV1 to REV2 (which must be on the same branch).

    `REV1::REV2'
          The same, but excluding REV1.

    `:REV'
    `::REV'
          Revisions from the beginning of the branch up to and
          including REV.

    `REV:'
          Revisions starting with REV to the end of the branch
          containing REV.

    `REV::'
          Revisions starting just after REV to the end of the branch
          containing REV.

    `BRANCH'
          An argument that is a branch means all revisions on that
          branch.

    `BRANCH1:BRANCH2'
    `BRANCH1::BRANCH2'
          A range of branches means all revisions on the branches in
          that range.

    `BRANCH.'
          The latest revision in BRANCH.

     A bare `-r' with no revisions means the latest revision on the
     default branch, normally the trunk.  There can be no space between
     the `-r' option and its argument.

`-S'
     Suppress the header if no revisions are selected.

`-s STATES'
     Print information about revisions whose state attributes match one
     of the states given in the comma-separated list STATES.

`-t'
     Print the same as `-h', plus the descriptive text.

`-wLOGINS'
     Print information about revisions checked in by users with login
     names appearing in the comma-separated list LOGINS.  If LOGINS is
     omitted, the user's login is assumed.  There can be no space
     between the `-w' option and its argument.

   `log' prints the intersection of the revisions selected with the
options `-d', `-s', and `-w', intersected with the union of the
revisions selected by `-b' and `-r'.

rdiff--'patch' format diffs between releases
============================================

   * rdiff [-flags] [-V vn] [-r t|-D d [-r t2|-D d2]] modules...

   * Requires: repository.

   * Changes: nothing.

   * Synonym: patch

   Builds a Larry Wall format patch(1) file between two releases, that
can be fed directly into the `patch' program to bring an old release
up-to-date with the new release.  (This is one of the few CVS commands
that operates directly from the repository, and doesn't require a prior
checkout.) The diff output is sent to the standard output device.

   You can specify (using the standard `-r' and `-D' options) any
combination of one or two revisions or dates.  If only one revision or
date is specified, the patch file reflects differences between that
revision or date and the current head revisions in the RCS file.

   Note that if the software release affected is contained in more than
one directory, then it may be necessary to specify the `-p' option to
the `patch' command when patching the old sources, so that `patch' is
able to find the files that are located in other directories.

File: cvs.info,  Node: rdiff options,  Next: rdiff examples,  Up: rdiff

rdiff options
-------------

   These standard options are supported by `rdiff' (*note Common
options::, for a complete description of them):

`-D DATE'
     Use the most recent revision no later than DATE.

`-f'
     If no matching revision is found, retrieve the most recent
     revision (instead of ignoring the file).

`-l'
     Local; don't descend subdirectories.

`-R'
     Examine directories recursively.  This option is on by default.

`-r TAG'
     Use revision TAG.

   In addition to the above, these options are available:

`-c'
     Use the context diff format.  This is the default format.

`-s'
     Create a summary change report instead of a patch.  The summary
     includes information about files that were changed or added
     between the releases.  It is sent to the standard output device.
     This is useful for finding out, for example, which files have
     changed between two dates or revisions.

`-t'
     A diff of the top two revisions is sent to the standard output
     device.  This is most useful for seeing what the last change to a
     file was.

`-u'
     Use the unidiff format for the context diffs.  Remember that old
     versions of the `patch' program can't handle the unidiff format,
     so if you plan to post this patch to the net you should probably
     not use `-u'.

`-V VN'
     Expand keywords according to the rules current in RCS version VN
     (the expansion format changed with RCS version 5).  Note that this
     option is no longer accepted.  CVS will always expand keywords the
     way that RCS version 5 does.

rdiff examples
--------------

   Suppose you receive mail from foo@example.net asking for an update
from release 1.2 to 1.4 of the tc compiler.  You have no such patches
on hand, but with CVS that can easily be fixed with a command such as
this:

     $ cvs rdiff -c -r FOO1_2 -r FOO1_4 tc | \
     $$ Mail -s 'The patches you asked for' foo@example.net

   Suppose you have made release 1.3, and forked a branch called
`R_1_3fix' for bug fixes.  `R_1_3_1' corresponds to release 1.3.1,
which was made some time ago.  Now, you want to see how much
development has been done on the branch.  This command can be used:

     $ cvs patch -s -r R_1_3_1 -r R_1_3fix module-name
     cvs rdiff: Diffing module-name

release--Indicate that a Module is no longer in use
===================================================

   * release [-d] directories...

   * Requires: Working directory.

   * Changes: Working directory, history log.

   This command is meant to safely cancel the effect of `cvs checkout'.
Since CVS doesn't lock files, it isn't strictly necessary to use this
command.  You can always simply delete your working directory, if you
like; but you risk losing changes you may have forgotten, and you leave
no trace in the CVS history file (*note history file::) that you've
abandoned your checkout.

   Use `cvs release' to avoid these problems.  This command checks that
no uncommitted changes are present; that you are executing it from
immediately above a CVS working directory; and that the repository
recorded for your files is the same as the repository defined in the
module database.

   If all these conditions are true, `cvs release' leaves a record of
its execution (attesting to your intentionally abandoning your
checkout) in the CVS history log.

release options
---------------

   The `release' command supports one command option:

`-d'
     Delete your working copy of the file if the release succeeds.  If
     this flag is not given your files will remain in your working
     directory.

     *WARNING:  The `release' command deletes all directories and files
     recursively.  This has the very serious side-effect that any
     directory that you have created inside your checked-out sources,
     and not added to the repository (using the `add' command; *note
     Adding files::) will be silently deleted--even if it is non-empty!*

release output
--------------

   Before `release' releases your sources it will print a one-line
message for any file that is not up-to-date.

`U FILE'
`P FILE'
     There exists a newer revision of this file in the repository, and
     you have not modified your local copy of the file (`U' and `P'
     mean the same thing).

`A FILE'
     The file has been added to your private copy of the sources, but
     has not yet been committed to the repository.  If you delete your
     copy of the sources this file will be lost.

`R FILE'
     The file has been removed from your private copy of the sources,
     but has not yet been removed from the repository, since you have
     not yet committed the removal.  *Note commit::.

`M FILE'
     The file is modified in your working directory.  There might also
     be a newer revision inside the repository.

`? FILE'
     FILE is in your working directory, but does not correspond to
     anything in the source repository, and is not in the list of files
     for CVS to ignore (see the description of the `-I' option, and
     *note cvsignore::).  If you remove your working sources, this file
     will be lost.

   After you've run checkout to create your private copy of source from
the common repository, other developers will continue changing the

update options
--------------

   These standard options are available with `update' (*note Common
options::, for a complete description of them):

`-D date'
     Use the most recent revision no later than DATE.  This option is
     sticky, and implies `-P'.  See *Note Sticky tags::, for more
     information on sticky tags/dates.

`-f'
     Only useful with the `-D DATE' or `-r TAG' flags.  If no matching
     revision is found, retrieve the most recent revision (instead of
     ignoring the file).

`-k KFLAG'
     Process keywords according to KFLAG.  See *Note Keyword
     substitution::.  This option is sticky; future updates of this
     file in this working directory will use the same KFLAG.  The
     `status' command can be viewed to see the sticky options.  See
     *Note Invoking CVS::, for more information on the `status' command.

`-l'
     Local; run only in current working directory.  *Note Recursive
     behavior::.

`-P'
     Prune empty directories.  See *Note Moving directories::.

`-p'
     Pipe files to the standard output.

`-R'
     Update directories recursively (default).  *Note Recursive
     behavior::.

`-r rev'
     Retrieve revision/tag REV.  This option is sticky, and implies
     `-P'.  See *Note Sticky tags::, for more information on sticky
     tags/dates.

   These special options are also available with `update'.

`-A'
     Reset any sticky tags, dates, or `-k' options.  See *Note Sticky
     tags::, for more information on sticky tags/dates.

`-C'
     Overwrite locally modified files with clean copies from the
     repository (the modified file is saved in `.#FILE.REVISION',
     however).

`-d'
     Create any directories that exist in the repository if they're
     missing from the working directory.  Normally, `update' acts only
     on directories and files that were already enrolled in your
     working directory.

     This is useful for updating directories that were created in the
     repository since the initial checkout; but it has an unfortunate
     side effect.  If you deliberately avoided certain directories in
     the repository when you created your working directory (either
     through use of a module name or by listing explicitly the files
     and directories you wanted on the command line), then updating
     with `-d' will create those directories, which may not be what you
     want.

`-I NAME'
     Ignore files whose names match NAME (in your working directory)
     during the update.  You can specify `-I' more than once on the
     command line to specify several files to ignore.  Use `-I !' to
     avoid ignoring any files at all.  *Note cvsignore::, for other
     ways to make CVS ignore some files.

`-WSPEC'
     Specify file names that should be filtered during update.  You can
     use this option repeatedly.

     SPEC can be a file name pattern of the same type that you can
     specify in the `.cvswrappers' file. *Note Wrappers::.

`-jREVISION'
     With two `-j' options, merge changes from the revision specified
     with the first `-j' option to the revision specified with the
     second `j' option, into the working directory.

     With one `-j' option, merge changes from the ancestor revision to
     the revision specified with the `-j' option, into the working
     directory.  The ancestor revision is the common ancestor of the
     revision which the working directory is based on, and the revision
     specified in the `-j' option.

     Note that using a single `-j TAGNAME' option rather than `-j
     BRANCHNAME' to merge changes from a branch will often not remove
     files which were removed on the branch.  *Note Merging adds and
     removals::, for more.

     In addition, each `-j' option can contain an optional date
     specification which, when used with branches, can limit the chosen
     revision to one within a specific date.  An optional date is
     specified by adding a colon (:) to the tag:
     `-jSYMBOLIC_TAG:DATE_SPECIFIER'.

     *Note Branching and merging::.

update output
-------------

   `update' and `checkout' keep you informed of their progress by
printing a line for each file, preceded by one character indicating the
status of the file:

`U FILE'
     The file was brought up to date with respect to the repository.
     This is done for any file that exists in the repository but not in
     your source, and for files that you haven't changed but are not
     the most recent versions available in the repository.

`P FILE'
     Like `U', but the CVS server sends a patch instead of an entire
     file.  This accomplishes the same thing as `U' using less
     bandwidth.

`A FILE'
     The file has been added to your private copy of the sources, and
     will be added to the source repository when you run `commit' on
     the file.  This is a reminder to you that the file needs to be
     committed.

`R FILE'
     The file has been removed from your private copy of the sources,
     and will be removed from the source repository when you run
     `commit' on the file.  This is a reminder to you that the file
     needs to be committed.

`M FILE'
     The file is modified in  your  working  directory.

     `M' can indicate one of two states for a file you're working on:
     either there were no modifications to the same file in the
     repository, so that your file remains as you last saw it; or there
     were modifications in the repository as well as in your copy, but
     they were merged successfully, without conflict, in your working
     directory.

     CVS will print some messages if it merges your work, and a backup
     copy of your working file (as it looked before you ran `update')
     will be made.  The exact name of that file is printed while
     `update' runs.

`C FILE'
     A conflict was detected while trying to merge your changes to FILE
     with changes from the source repository.  FILE (the copy in your
     working directory) is now the result of attempting to merge the
     two revisions; an unmodified copy of your file is also in your
     working directory, with the name `.#FILE.REVISION' where REVISION
     is the revision that your modified file started from.  Resolve the
     conflict as described in *Note Conflicts example::.  (Note that
     some systems automatically purge files that begin with `.#' if
     they have not been accessed for a few days.  If you intend to keep
     a copy of your original file, it is a very good idea to rename
     it.)  Under VMS, the file name starts with `__' rather than `.#'.

`? FILE'
     FILE is in your working directory, but does not correspond to
     anything in the source repository, and is not in the list of files
     for CVS to ignore (see the description of the `-I' option, and
     *note cvsignore::).
