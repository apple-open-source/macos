/* 
 * Function: DNSNameListBufferCreate
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   Convert the given list of DNS domain names into either of two formats
 *   described in RFC 1035.  If "buffer" is NULL, this routine allocates
 *   a buffer of sufficient size and returns its size in "buffer_size".
 *   Use free() to release the memory.
 *
 *   If "buffer" is not NULL, this routine places at most "buffer_size" 
 *   bytes into "buffer".  If "buffer" is too small, NULL is returned, and
 *   "buffer_size" reflects the number of bytes used in the partial conversion.
 *
 *   If "compact" is TRUE, generates the compact form (RFC 1035 section 4.1.4),
 *   otherwise generates the non-compact form (RFC 1035 section 3.1).
 *   
 * Returns:
 *   NULL if the conversion failed, non-NULL otherwise.

 *   dynamically allocated in a single allocation.  Use free() to release
 *   the memory.

 * Returns:
 *   NULL if an error occurred i.e. buffer did not contain a valid encoding.
 *   non-NULL if the conversion was successful, and "names_count" contains
 *   the number of names in the returned list.
