 * - the identifier string format is:
 *   		%x,%x:%x...:%x
 * - the byte before the slash '/' is the arp hardware type (or 0),
 *   the bytes following the slash are the hardware address bytes, or
 *   the opaque client identifier bytes
 * - each returns NULL if a failure occurred, a non-NULL pointer otherwise;
 *   the non-NULL pointer may be freed using free()
 * - arp hardware types are defined in the "Assigned Numbers RFC",
 *   currently this is RFC 1700 (look for "hrd")
