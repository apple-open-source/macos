/*
 * Function: IPConfigurationServiceCreate
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   Instantiate a new service over the specified interface that is managed
 *   and maintained by the IPConfiguration server.
 *
 *   Currently only supports creating an IPv6 Automatic service. That service
 *   is ineligible to become primary. The caller is responsible for publishing
 *   the service information to the SCDynamic store when it receives
 *   notifications that the service information is available.
 *
 *   Use IPConfigurationServiceCopyInformation() to copy the current
 *   service information.
 *
 *   Use IPConfigurationServiceGetNotificationKey() to get the SCDynamicStore
 *   key that is notified when the service information changes.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   interface_name		: the BSD name of the interface e.g. "pdp_ip0"
 *   options			: either NULL, or a dictionary that only
 *				  contains properties with keys specified
 * 				  under "IPConfigurationService Options" above
 * Returns:
 *   Non-NULL IPConfigurationServiceRef if the service was successfully
 *   instantiated, NULL otherwise
 *
 * Note:
 * - When the last reference to the IPConfigurationServiceRef is removed by
 *   calling CFRelease(), the service is terminated by IPConfiguration.
 * - Invoking this function multiple times with the same parameters will
 *   cause an existing service to first be deallocated.  The net result
 *   is that there will only ever be one active service of the specified
 *   type for the specified interface.
 * - If the process that invokes this function terminates, the 
 *   service will be terminated by IPConfiguration.

/*
 * Function: IPConfigurationServiceCopyInformation
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   Retrieves the service information for the specified 'service'.  The
 *   format of the returned information is a dictionary of dictionaries.
 *   The key of each sub-dictionary is a kSCEntNet* key as defined in
 *   <SystemConfiguration/SCSchemaDefinitions.h>.  The value of each dictionary
 *   is a dictionary of keys matching the schema for the particular kSCEntNet*
 *   key.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   service			: the service to monitor
 *
 * Returns:
 *   NULL if no information is ready for consumption, non-NULL dictionary of
 *   service information otherwise.
 * 
 * Example of returned information:
 * <dict>
 *     <key>IPv6</key>
 *     <dict>
 *         <key>Addresses</key>
 *         <array>
