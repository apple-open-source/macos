.Dt BOOTPD 8
.Os "Mac OS X"
.Sh NAME
.Nm bootpd
.Nd DHCP/BOOTP
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
\fI[options]\fR
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm 
implements a DHCP/BOOTP server as
defined in RFC951, RFC1542, RFC2131, and RFC2132, as well as a BOOTP/DHCP
relay agent.
.Pp
.Nm
understands and handles requests that arrive via a DHCP/BOOTP relay agent,
allowing the server to be centrally located, and serve many remote subnets.
.Pp
The server is normally invoked by
.Xr launchd 8
when a request arrives, 
but can also be invoked manually.  If it is invoked by 
.Xr launchd 8 ,
.Nm
continues to service requests until it is idle for a period of 
5 minutes, after which it exits to conserve system resources.  If invoked 
manually,
.Nm 
continues to run indefinitely.
.Pp
If
.Nm
receives a SIGHUP (-1) signal, it will re-read its configuration and client
binding files.
.Pp
When a request from a client arrives, the server logs an entry to 
\fI/var/log/system.log\fR indicating which client made the request, and 
logs another entry once a reply is sent.  This feature can be turned off 
using the 
.Fl q
option described below.
.Pp
.Nm
reads its configuration from \fIbootpd.plist\fR, a plist that by default is
expected to exist as \fI/etc/bootpd.plist\fR. An alternate path can be
specified using the
.Fl f
option.
There are also a number of command-line options to change its behavior on the
fly.  Note in particular that options \fBDrS\fR
can also be controlled via service-control properties.  See
.Xr "Service Controls and Filters"
below.
.Sh "OPTIONS"
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl B
Disable BOOTP service.  BOOTP is now disabled by default, so specifying
this option has no effect.
.It Fl b
Only respond if the client's bootfile exists: for BOOTP clients only.
.It Fl D
Enable DHCP service.  By default, DHCP service is disabled.
.It Fl d
Remain in the foreground and produce extra debugging output to stderr.
.It Fl f Ar "filename"
Specify an alternate \fIbootpd.plist\fR configuration file instead
of the default \fI/etc/bootpd.plist\fR.
.It Fl I
Disable re-initialization on IP address changes.  By default, 
changes to the server's configured IP addresses cause it to 
re-initialize.
.It Fl i Ar "interface"
Enable service on the specified interface.  This flag may appear
multiple times to enable multiple interfaces. For example, 
.nf
    bootpd -i en0 -i en1
.fi
forces
.Nm
to respond only to requests received on
ethernet ports en0 and en1.  By default, all interfaces are enabled.
.It Fl o Ar hop_count
For relay agent operation, the maximum hop count, default is 4 hops.
.It Fl q
Be quiet as possible.  Only report serious errors to
.It Fl r Ar server_ip
Relay packets to the specified server_ip, not exceeding the hop count.  
This option can be specified multiple times, one for each server to relay to.
.It Fl S
Enable BOOTP service.
.It Fl v
Be more verbose in messages logged to \fI/var/log/system.log\fR.
.El
.Sh "CONFIGURING BOOTPD"
.Nm
reads its configuration from \fIbootpd.plist\fR\fR, an XML property list.
The root of the property list is a dictionary.  The property list has two main
areas:
.Bl -tag -width "Root dictionary"
.It "Root dictionary"
Service Controls and Filters
.It "Subnets"
Subnet Entries
.El
.Ss "Service Controls and Filters"
The root dictionary in \fIbootpd.plist\fR contains properties to control
whether
.Nm
will respond to a particular request,   There are MAC address filters,
DHCP controls, as well as controls to enable services.
.Bl -tag -width allow
.Pp
The MAC address filter properties are:
.It Sy allow
(Array of String) Enables servicing a list of MAC addresses.
.It Sy deny
(Array of String) Disables servicing a list of MAC addresses.
.El
.Pp
When a packet arrives,
.Nm
checks whether the client's MAC address is in the \fBdeny\fR list.  If it is,
the packet is dropped.  Otherwise, if the client's MAC address is in the
\fBallow\fR
list, the packet continues to be processed, otherwise it is dropped.  If
neither the \fBallow\fR nor the \fBdeny\fR property is specified, the packet
continues to be processed.
.Pp
Allow/deny filtering can be disabled using the \fBignore_allow_deny\fR
property:
.Bl -tag -width ignore_allow_deny
.It Sy ignore_allow_deny
(Array of String) Disable allow/deny processing on the specified list of
interfaces. When a packet arrives on an interface in this list, processing
continues without consulting the allow/deny filters.
.El
.Pp
The service-control properties are:
.Bl -tag -width ignore_allow_deny
.It Sy bootp_enabled
Enables BOOTP on the specified list of interfaces.
.It Sy dhcp_enabled
Enables DHCP on the specified list of interfaces.
.It Sy relay_enabled
Enables the relay agent on the specified list of interfaces.  Note that this
option also requires the \fBrelay_ip_list\fR property to be specified.
.El
.Pp
For each of the properties dhcp_enabled, bootp_enabled,
and relay_enabled, the corresponding
service can be enabled or disabled for all interfaces, or enabled for just
a specific set of interfaces.  To enable or disable globally, use a 
\fIboolean\fR
value \fItrue\fR or \fIfalse\fR respectively.
To enable just for a specific set of
interfaces, use either a string, for a single interface, or an array of
strings, one element for each interface.
.Pp
For example, to enable DHCP on interfaces en0 and en1, disable BOOTP on all
interfaces, and enable relay agent on interface en1,
\fIbootpd.plist\fR could contain:
.nf
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
        <key>bootp_enabled</key>
        <false/>
        <key>dhcp_enabled</key>
        <array>
                <string>en0</string>
                <string>en1</string>
        </array>
        <key>relay_enabled</key>
        <array>
                <string>en1</string>
        </array>
</dict>
</plist>
.fi
.Bl -tag -width detect_other_dhcp_server
.Pp
Some additional properties are:
.It Sy relay_ip_list
(Array of String) If relay agent functionality is enabled
(see \fBrelay_enabled\fR above), this
property contains the list of IP addresses to relay the packet to.
.It Sy detect_other_dhcp_server
(Boolean, Array of String) Enables detecting another DHCP server
either globally (Boolean), or only on the specified list
of interfaces (Array of String). When another DHCP server is detected
on an interface, DHCP service is disabled on that interface until the next time
.Nm
receives a SIGHUP, or exits.
.It Sy reply_threshold_seconds
(Integer)
.Nm
won't respond to the request until the bp_secs field is at least 
\fIreply_theshold_seconds\fR.  The default value is 0 (zero).
.It Sy use_open_directory
(Boolean) If this property is set to true,
.Nm
will look for static IP address to ethernet address bindings in
\fBOpen Directory\fR.  The default value is false.
.It Sy dhcp_ignore_client_identifier
(Boolean) If this property is set to true, the DHCP server tries to
ignore the DHCP client identifier option (code 61) in the client's
DHCP packet.   Instead, the DHCP server tries to use the hardware address
fields (bp_htype, bp_hlen, bp_chaddr) of the DHCP packet to identify the
client.  The default value of this property is false.
.It Sy dhcp_supply_bootfile
(Boolean) If this property is set to true, the DHCP server supplies the
bootfile specified in the static binding for a client in \fI/etc/bootptab\fR.
.It Sy use_server_config_for_dhcp_options
(Boolean) If this property is set to true, the DHCP server tries to use its own
configuration to supply the subnet mask, router, DNS server addresses,
DNS domain, and DNS domain search options, if those options are missing from
the subnet description.  If the property is false, 
the server only uses the information in the subnet description to supply
these DHCP options.
The default value of this property is true.
.El
.Ss "Subnet Entries"
The "Subnets" property in \fIbootpd.plist\fR contains an array of
dictionaries, each dictionary corresponds to a single subnet entry.
.Pp
A subnet entry describes a range of IP addresses, and associated
information, such as the subnet mask, router, DNS servers, and other
option data.  A subnet entry also indicates whether the range is
an address pool from which to allocate vs. simply an informational range
in order to fulfill requests for option information.  The informational range
is used when the client's IP address binding is static, or the client knows its
own IP address and simply wants relevant option information.
.Pp
A subnet entry is required to supply the DHCP service with
pool(s) of IP address(es), and to inform the server of subnet-specific
options and parameters.  A subnet entry can also be used to convey network
topology information via the \fBsupernet\fR property described below.
.Pp
Subnet entries may not overlap in the IP ranges the describe, nor specify 
values that are inconsistent. Specifically, applying the \fBnet_mask\fR value 
to each of the values in the \fBnet_range\fR must yield the 
\fBnet_address\fR value.
.Pp
Errors in configuration are logged to \fI/var/log/system.log\fR.  There
may be multiple entries for a given subnet, allowing different
configuration values to be specified for a given sub-range of IP addresses
within the subnet.  For example, part of the range might be used for
statically bound clients, and another for a dynamic address pool.
.Pp
Each subnet entry is encoded as a dictionary with the following
properties:
.Bl -tag -width client_types
.It Sy name
(String) A descriptive name for the subnet, e.g. "17.202.40/22".
.It Sy net_mask
(String) The network mask, e.g. "255.255.252.0".
This property is required.
.It Sy net_address
(String) The network address, e.g. "17.202.40.0".
This property is required.
.It Sy net_range
(Array of String) The network address range stored as two values: 
the first IP address and the last IP address.  For example:
.nf
	<array>
		<string>17.202.40.2</string>
		<string>17.202.43.254</string>
	</array>
.fi
This property is required.
.It Sy allocate
(Boolean) Indicates whether the DHCP service should allocate IP addresses
from the range specified by \fBnet_range\fR.  A \fItrue\fR value means
allocate IP addresses, otherwise, the subnet entry is informational only.
.It Sy lease_min
(Integer) The minimum allowable lease time (in seconds). This property is
ignored unless \fBallocate\fR specifies \fItrue\fR.  
Default value is 3600 (one hour).
.It Sy lease_max
(Integer) The maximum allowable lease time (in seconds). This property is
ignored unless \fBallocate\fR specifies \fItrue\fR.
Default value is 3600 (one hour).
.It Sy supernet
(String) This property indicates that the subnet is on the same physical
broadcast domain as other subnets with the same supernet value.
.El
.Pp
The server can also supply clients with the following DHCP option
information:
.Bl -tag -width client_types
.It Sy dhcp_router
The IP address of the default router (DHCP option code 3).  If this
property is not present, the server will attempt to provide its own
default route for this option, if it is applicable.
.It Sy dhcp_domain_name_server
The IP address(es) of the DNS server(s) (option code 6).  If this
property is not present, the server will supply its own DNS server 
configuration (if available).
.It Sy dhcp_domain_name
The default DNS domain name (option code 15).  If this property is not
present, the server will supply its own default domain name (if available).
.It Sy dhcp_domain_search
The domain search list (option code 119).  If this property is not
present, the server will supply its domain search list (if available).
.It Sy dhcp_classless_static_route
The classless static route (option code 121).  The list of static routes is
specified using an array of strings. The array is interpreted as an array of
string pairs, the first element of the pair describes the destination network
using the notation
"\fI<destination_ip>\fR/\fI<prefix_length>\fR", and the second element gives the
gateway as "\fI<gateway_ip\fR". If "\fI<gateway_ip>\fR" is "0.0.0.0",
the destination is the interface itself.
.Pp
For example:
.nf
	<key>dhcp_classless_static_route</key>
	<array>
		<string>192.168.100.0/22</string>
		<string>0.0.0.0</string>
		<string>44.100.100.100/22</string>
		<string>192.168.100.1</string>
		<string>129.210.177.132/25</string>
		<string>1.1.1.1</string>
	</array>
.fi
.Pp
The first route has destination 192.168.100.0/22 and gateway 0.0.0.0 which
means 192.168.100.0/22 is directly reachable on the link.  The second route
has destination 44.100.100.100/22 and gateway 192.168.100.1. The third route
has destination 129.210.177.132/25 and gateway 1.1.1.1.
.It Sy dhcp_ldap_url
The default LDAP URL (option code 95).
.It Sy dhcp_netinfo_server_address
The NetInfo parent server IP address(es) (option code 112).
.It Sy dhcp_netinfo_server_tag
The NetInfo parent domain tag (option code 113).
.It Sy dhcp_url
The default URL to present in a web browser (option code 114).
.It Sy dhcp_time_offset
The time offset from GMT in seconds (option code 2).
.It Sy dhcp_network_time_protocol_servers
The network time protocol (NTP) server IP address(es) (option code 42).
.It Sy dhcp_nb_over_tcpip_name_server
The NetBIOS over TCP/IP name server IP address(es) (option code 44).
.It Sy dhcp_nb_over_tcpip_dgram_dist_server
The NetBIOS over TCP/IP datagram distribution server IP address(es)
(option code 45).
.It Sy dhcp_nb_over_tcpip_node_type
The NetBIOS over TCP/IP node type (option code 46).
.It Sy dhcp_nb_over_tcpip_scope
The NetBIOS over TCP/IP scope string (option code 47).
.It Sy dhcp_smtp_server
The Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) server IP address(es)
(option code 69).
.It Sy dhcp_pop3_server
The Post Office Protocol (POP3) server IP address(es) (option code 70).
.It Sy dhcp_nntp_server
The Network News Transport Protocol (NNTP) server IP address(es)
(option code 71).
.It Sy dhcp_proxy_auto_discovery_url
The default Web Proxy Auto Discovery URL (option code 252).
.El
.Pp
DHCP options may also be specified using the naming convention:
.nf
	dhcp_option_\fIoption_code\fR
.fi
replacing \fIoption_code\fR with a numeric value in the range of 1 through
254.  For example, to specify option code 128, specify a property named
\fBdhcp_option_128\fR.
.Pp
.Nm
has a built-in type conversion table for many more options, mostly those
specified in RFC 2132, and will try to convert from whatever type the
option appears in the property list to the binary, packet format.  For example,
if 
.Nm
knows that the type of the option is an IP address or list of IP addresses, it
converts from the string form of the IP address to the binary, network
byte order numeric value.
.Pp
If the type of the option is a numeric value, it converts from string,
integer, or boolean, to the proper sized, network byte-order numeric value.
.Pp
Regardless of whether
.Nm
knows the type of the option or not, you can always specify the DHCP option
using the \fIdata\fR property list type  e.g.:
.nf
	<key>dhcp_option_128</key>
	<data>
	AAqV1Tzo
	</data>
.fi
.El
.Sh "BOOTP/DHCP STATIC BINDINGS"
Static IP address to ethernet address bindings are stored in the
\fI/etc/bootptab\fR file and in \fBOpen Directory\fR.
Bindings specified in the \fI/etc/bootptab\fR file take
precedence over those in \fBOpen Directory\fR.
.Pp
See
.Xr bootptab 5
for more information about the \fI/etc/bootptab\fR file.
.Pp
For \fBOpen Directory\fR,
.Nm
looks at the /Computers records for the following properties:
.Bl -tag -width IPAddressAndENetAddress
.It Sy ENetAddress
(String) The ethernet MAC address(es) of the computer.
Each address must be of the form xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx using only the
characters 0123456789abcdef.
Leading zeros must be specified.
.It Sy IPAddress
(String) The IP address(es) of the computer.
.It Sy IPAddressAndENetAddress
(String) Pairs of IP and Ethernet MAC addresses of the computer.  Each
address pair consists of an single IP and MAC address separated by a
slash character, e.g. "192.168.1.1/01:23:45:67:89:ab".
This attribute should be provided when multiple addresses are provided
because not all directories return attribute values in a guaranteed order.
.It Sy BootFile
(String) The bootfile to use for this computer.
.El
.Sh "DHCP SERVICE"
.Pp
If DHCP service is enabled for a client, the server processes the client's
packet.  The packet may be a request for an IP address and option information
(DHCP Discover, DHCP Request) or for just option information 
(DHCP Inform).  The packet might also tell the server that the address is 
in use by some other host (DHCP Decline), or that the client is done with
the IP address (DHCP Release).
.Pp
The server uses the DHCP client identifier (option 61) if it is present
as the unique client identifier, otherwise it uses the htype/hlen/chaddr
fields in the DHCP packet.
.Ss "IP Allocation"
The DHCP server first tries to find a static binding for the client (see section
.Xr "BOOTP/DHCP STATIC BINDINGS"
above).  If one exists, it uses it.  If not, it tries to find an existing 
dynamic binding from its lease database, stored in /var/db/dhcpd_leases.  
If one exists and it is applicable to the subnet, the server uses it,
otherwise, it tries to allocate an address from one of its address pools.
If an address is available, the server uses it, otherwise the packet is
discarded.
.Pp
After a suitable IP address is found for the client, the server attempts to
insert as many of the requested DHCP options from the client's request as it
can into the reply.
.Pp
When the server allocates an address dynamically, it automatically excludes
addresses that appear in static host entries.  For example, if
the address range goes from 10.0.0.2 through 10.0.0.10, but there is
a static entry that specifies 10.0.0.3, that address is automatically excluded
from the pool.
.Pp
The server tries to give the same address back to a client by remembering
the binding even after it has expired.  The server removes an expired lease
entry only when it runs out of addresses, and needs to reclaim an address
in order to fulfill a new request.
.Pp
When the server receives a DHCP Release packet, it sets the expiration for that
lease to now, so that it can immediately reclaim the address if needed.
.Pp
When the server receives a DHCP Decline packet, it removes the client binding
from the IP address, and sets the expiration on the "unbound" lease to
10 minutes from now.  That allows the address to return to the address 
pool again without manual intervention and avoids handing out the same
in-use IP address over and over.
.Xr "BOOTP/DHCP STATIC BINDINGS"
above), or the server must have an applicable dynamic pool of IP addresses, 
just as with DHCP.
