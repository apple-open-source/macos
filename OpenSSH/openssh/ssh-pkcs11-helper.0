SSH-PKCS11-HELPER(8)        System Manager's Manual       SSH-PKCS11-HELPER(8)

NAME
     ssh-pkcs11-helper M-bM-^@M-^S OpenSSH helper for PKCS#11 support

SYNOPSIS
     ssh-pkcs11-helper [-v]

DESCRIPTION
     ssh-pkcs11-helper is used by ssh(1), ssh-agent(1), and ssh-keygen(1) to
     access keys provided by a PKCS#11 token.

     ssh-pkcs11-helper is not intended to be invoked directly by the user.

     A single option is supported:

     -v      Verbose mode.  Causes ssh-pkcs11-helper to print debugging
             messages about its progress.  This is helpful in debugging
             problems.  Multiple -v options increase the verbosity.  The
             maximum is 3.

             Note that ssh(1), ssh-agent(1), and ssh-keygen(1) will
             automatically pass the -v flag to ssh-pkcs11-helper when they
             have themselves been placed in debug mode.

SEE ALSO
