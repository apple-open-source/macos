.Nm apple_ssh_and_fips
.Nd Configuring SSH for FIPS algorithms
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The macOS version of SSH uses Appleâ€™s FIPS Cryptographic Modules for
FIPS 140-2 validated algorithms, automatically without the need for
installation, administration, or configuration.  To restrict the SSH
client and server to use
.Em only
FIPS algorithms, customize the configuration as directed below.
.Pp
The configuration files for
.Xr ssh 1
and
.Xr sshd 8
read the algorithm configuration directives from
.Pa /etc/ssh/crypto.conf ,
which should be a symbolic link to either the macOS
default algorithm configuration file
.Pa /etc/ssh/crypto/apple.conf ,
or to the FIPS-only configuration file
.Pa /etc/ssh/crypto/fips.conf .
To choose FIPS algorithms
.Em only ,
update the symbolic
link as follows.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sudo ln -fs crypto/fips.conf /etc/ssh/crypto.conf
.Ed
.Pp
To return to the default set of algorithms which largely prefer FIPS
algorithms but allow others as well:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sudo ln -fs crypto/apple.conf /etc/ssh/crypto.conf
