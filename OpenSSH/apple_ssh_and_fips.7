.Sh NAME
.Nm apple_ssh_and_fips
.Nd Configuring SSH for FIPS algorithms
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The macOS version of SSH uses Appleâ€™s FIPS Cryptographic Modules for
FIPS 140-2 validated algorithms, automatically without the need for
installation, administration, or configuration.  To restrict the SSH
client and server to use
.Em only
FIPS algorithms, customize the configuration as directed below.
.Pp
The configuration files for
.Xr ssh 1
and
.Xr sshd 8
read the algorithm configuration directives from
.Pa /etc/ssh/crypto.conf ,
which should be a symbolic link to either the macOS
default algorithm configuration file
.Pa /etc/ssh/crypto/apple.conf ,
or to the FIPS-only configuration file
.Pa /etc/ssh/crypto/fips.conf .
To choose FIPS algorithms
.Em only ,
update the symbolic
link as follows.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sudo ln -fs crypto/fips.conf /etc/ssh/crypto.conf
.Ed
.Pp
To return to the default set of algorithms which largely prefer FIPS
algorithms but allow others as well:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sudo ln -fs crypto/apple.conf /etc/ssh/crypto.conf
.Ed
.Pp
.Sh HISTORY
.Pa /etc/ssh/crypto.conf ,
.Pa /etc/ssh/crypto/apple.conf ,
and
.Pa /etc/ssh/crypto/fips.conf
appeared in macOS 15 Sequoia.
.Sh CAVEATS
When upgrading from a previous version of macOS,
the OpenSSH configuration directory
.Pa /etc/ssh
is preserved.
Thus, when upgrading from versions prior to macOS 15 Sequoia,
the files mentioned in this manual page may not be present.
To reset the OpenSSH configuration to macOS defaults,
run the following command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sudo /usr/libexec/reset-ssh-configuration
.Ed
.Pp
.Sy WARNING :
The above command will discard the existing configuration
with the exception of host keys.
