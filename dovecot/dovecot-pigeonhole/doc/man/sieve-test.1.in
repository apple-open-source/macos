.SH NAME
sieve\-test \- Pigeonhole\(aqs Sieve script tester
.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sieve\-test
.RI [ options ]
.I script\-file
.I mail\-file
.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBsieve\-test\fP command is part of the Pigeonhole Project
(\fBpigeonhole\fR(7)), which adds Sieve (RFC 5228) support to the Dovecot
secure IMAP and POP3 server (\fBdovecot\fR(1)).
.PP
Using the \fBsieve\-test\fP command, the execution of Sieve scripts can be
tested. This evaluates the script for the provided message, yielding a set of
Sieve actions. Unless the \fB\-e\fP option is specified, it does not actually
execute these actions, meaning that it does not store or forward the message
anywere. In stead, it prints a detailed list of what actions would normally take
place. Note that, even when \fB\-e\fP is specified, no messages are ever
transmitted to remote SMTP recipients. The outgoing messages are always printed
to \fBstdout\fP in stead.
.PP
This is a very useful tool to debug the execution of Sieve scripts. It can be
used to verify newly installed scripts for the intended behaviour and it can
provide more detailed information about script execution problems that are
reported by the Sieve plugin, for example by tracing the execution and
evaluation of commands and tests respectively.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-c\  config\-file
Alternative Dovecot configuration file path.
.TP
.B \-C
Force compilation. By default, the compiled binary is stored on disk. When this
binary is found during the next execution of \fBsieve\-test\fP and its
modification time is more recent than the script file, it is used and the script
is not compiled again. This option forces the script to be compiled, thus
ignoring any present binary. Refer to \fBsievec\fP(1) for more information about
Sieve compilation.
.TP
.B \-D
Enable Sieve debugging.
.TP
.BI \-d\  dump\-file
Causes a dump of the generated code to be written to the specified file. This is
identical to the dump produced by \fBsieve\-dump\fR(1). Using \(aq\-\(aq as
filename causes the dump to be written to \fBstdout\fP.
.TP
.BI \-e
Enables true execution of the set of actions that results from running the
script. In combination with the \fB\-l\fP parameter, the actual delivery of
messages can be tested. Note that this will not transmit any messages to remote
SMTP recipients. Such actions only print the outgoing message to \fBstdout\fP.
.TP
.BI \-f\  envelope\-sender
The envelope sender or return path. This is what Sieve\(aqs envelope test will
compare to when the \(dqfrom\(dq envelope part is requested. Also, this is
where response messages are sent to.
.TP
.BI \-l\  mail\-location
The location of the user\(aqs mail store. The syntax of this option\(aqs
\fImail\-location\fP parameter is identical to what is used for the
mail_location setting in the Dovecot config file. This parameter is typically
used in combination with \fB\-e\fP to test the actual delivery of messages. If
\fB\-l\fP is omitted when \fB\-e\fP is specified, mail store actions like
fileinto and keep are skipped.
.TP
.BI \-m\  default\-mailbox
The mailbox where the keep action stores the message. This is \(dqINBOX\(dq
by default.
.TP
.BI \-r\  recipient\-address
The envelope recipient address. This is what Sieve\(aqs envelope test will compare
to when the \(dqto\(dq envelope part is requested. Some tests and actions will also
use this as the owner\(aqs e\-mail address.
.TP
.BI \-s\  script\-file
Specify additional scripts to be executed before the main script. Multiple
\fB\-s\fP arguments are allowed and the specified scripts are executed
sequentially in the order specified at the command
line.
.TP
.BI \-t\  trace\-file
Enables runtime trace debugging. Trace debugging provides detailed insight in
the operations performed by the Sieve script. Refer to the runtime trace
debugging section below. The trace information is written to the specified file.
Using '\-' as filename causes the trace data to be written to \fBstdout\fP.
.TP
.BI \-T\  trace\-option
Configures runtime trace debugging, which is enabled with the \fP\-t\fP option.
Refer to the runtime trace debugging section below.
.TP
.BI \-x\  extensions
Set the available extensions. The parameter is a space\-separated list of the
active extensions. By prepending the extension identifiers with \fB+\fP or
\fB\-\fP, extensions can be included or excluded relative to the default set of
extensions. If no extensions have a \fB+\fP or \fB\-\fP prefix, only those
extensions that are explicitly listed will be enabled. Unknown extensions are
ignored and a warning is produced. By default, all supported extensions are
available, except for deprecated extensions or those that are still under
development.

For example \fB\-x\fP \(dq+imapflags \-enotify\(dq will enable the deprecated
imapflags extension along with all extensions that are available by default,
except for the enotify extension.
.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I script\-file
Specifies the script to (compile and) execute.

Note that this tool looks for a pre\-compiled binary file with a \fI.svbin\fP
extension and with basename and path identical to the specified script. Use the
\fB\-C\fP option to disable this behavior by forcing the script to be compiled
into a new binary.
.TP
.I mail\-file
Specifies the file containing the e\-mail message to test with.
.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH USAGE
.SS RUNTIME TRACE DEBUGGING
.PP
Using the \fB\-t\fP option, the \fBsieve\-test\fP tool can be configured to print
detailed trace information on the Sieve script execution to a file or standard
output. For example, the encountered commands, the performed tests and the
matched values can be printed.
.PP
The runtime trace can be configured using the \fB\-T\fP option, which can be
specified multiple times. It can be used as follows:

.TP 2
\fB\-Tlevel=...\fP
Set the detail level of the trace debugging. One of the following values can
be supplied:
.RS 2
.TP 3
\fIactions\fP (default)
Only print executed action commands, like keep, fileinto, reject and redirect.
.TP
\fIcommands\fP
Print any executed command, excluding test commands.
.TP
\fItests\fP
Print all executed commands and performed tests.
.TP
\fImatching\fP
Print all executed commands, performed tests and the values matched in those
tests.
.RE
.TP 2
\fB\-Tdebug\fP
Print debug messages as well. This is usually only useful for developers and
is likely to produce messy output.
.TP
\fB\-Taddresses\fP
Print byte code addresses for the current trace output. Normally, only the
current Sieve source code position (line number) is printed. The byte code
addresses are equal to those listed in a binary dump produced using the
\fB\-d\fP option or by the \fBsieve\-dump(1)\fP command.
.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS DEBUG SIEVE EXTENSION
.PP
To improve script debugging, the Sieve command line tools such as
\fBsieve\-test\fP support a custom Sieve language extension called
\(aqvnd.dovecot.debug\(aq. It adds the \fBdebug_print\fP command that allows
printing debug messages to \fBstdout\fP.
.PP
Example:
.PP
require \(dqvnd.dovecot.debug\(dq;
.PP
if header :contains \(dqsubject\(dq \(dqhello\(dq {
.PP
  debug_print \(dqSubject header contains hello!\(dq;
.PP
}
.PP
Other tools like \fBsievec\fP and \fBsieve\-dump\fP also recognize the
vnd.dovecot.debug extension. In contrast, the actual Sieve plugin for the
Dovecot LDA (\fBdovecot\-lda\fR(1)) does not allow the use of the debug
extension. So, keep in mind that scripts and compiled binaries that refer to de
debug extension will fail to be run by the Sieve plugin itself.
.PP
Note that it is not necessary to enable nor possible to disable the availability
of the debug extension with the \fB\-x\fP option.
.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
