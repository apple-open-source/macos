.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sievec
.RI [ options ]
.I script\-file
.RI [ out\-file ]
.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBsieve\-dump\fP command is part of the Pigeonhole Project
(\fBpigeonhole\fR(7)), which adds Sieve (RFC 5228) support to the Dovecot
secure IMAP and POP3 server (\fBdovecot\fR(1)).
.PP
Using the \fBsievec\fP command, Sieve scripts can be compiled into a binary
representation. The resulting binary can be used directly to process e\-mail
messages during the delivery process. The delivery of mail messages and \- by
means of the LDA Sieve plugin \- also the execution of Sieve scripts is
performed by Dovecot\(aqs local delivery agent (LDA) called \fBdovecot\-lda\fP(1).
Usually, it is not necessaryto compile the Sieve script manually using
\fBsievec\fP, because \fBdovecot\-lda\fP will do this automatically if the binary
is missing. However, in some cases \fBdovecot\-lda\fP does not have permission to
write the compiled binary to disk, forcing it to recompile the script every time
it is executed. Using the \fBsievec\fP tool, this can be performed manually by
an authorized user to increase performance.
.PP
The Pigeonhole Sieve implementation recognizes files with a \fB.sieve\fP
extension as Sieve scripts and corresponding files with a \fB.svbin\fP extension
as the associated compiled binary. This means for example that Dovecot\(aqs LDA
process will first look for a binary file \(dqdovecot.svbin\(dq when it needs to
execute \(dqdovecot.sieve\(dq. It will compile a new binary when it is missing.
.PP
The \fBsievec\fP command is also useful to verify Sieve scripts before using.
Additionally, with the \fB\-d\fP option it can output a textual (and thus
human\-readable) dump of the generated Sieve code to the specified file. The
output is then identical to what the \fBsieve\-dump\fP(1) command produces for a
stored binary file. This output is mainly useful to find bugs in the compiler
that yield corrupt binaries.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-c\  config\-file
Alternative Dovecot configuration file path.
.TP
.B \-d
Don\(aqt write the binary to \fIout\-file\fP, but write a textual dump of the
binary instead. In this context, the \fIout\-file\fP value '\-' has special
meaning: it causes the the textual dump to be written to \fBstdout\fP.
The \fIout\-file\fP argument may also be omitted, which has the same effect
as '\-'.
The output is identical to what the \fBsieve\-dump\fP(1) command produces
for a compiled Sieve binary file. Note that this option is not allowed when the
\fIout\-file\fP argument is a directory.
.TP
.BI \-x\  extensions
Set the available extensions. The parameter is a space\-separated list of the
active extensions. By prepending the extension identifiers with \fB+\fP or
\fB\-\fP, extensions can be included or excluded relative to the default set of
extensions. If no extensions have a \fB+\fP or \fB\-\fP prefix, only
those extensions that are explicitly listed will be enabled. Unknown extensions
are ignored and a warning is produced. By default, all supported extensions are
available, except for deprecated extensions or those that are still under
development.

For example \fB\-x\fP \(dq+imapflags \-enotify\(dq will enable the deprecated
imapflags extension along with all extensions that are available by default,
except for the enotify extension.
.\"------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I script\-file
Specifies the script to be compiled. If the \fIscript\-file\fP argument is a
directory, all files in that directory with a \fI.sieve\fP extension are
compiled into a corresponding \fI.svbin\fP binary file. The compilation is not
halted upon errors; it attempts to compile as many scripts in the directory as
possible. Note that the \fB\-d\fP option and the \fIout\-file\fP argument are
not allowed when the \fIscript\-file\fP argument is a directory.
.TP
.I out\-file
Specifies where the (binary) output is to be written. This argument is optional.
If omitted a binary compiled from <scriptname>.sieve is saved as
<scriptname>.svbin. If \fB\-b\fP is specified, the binary dump is output to
\fBstdout\fP.

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.B sievec
will exit with one of the following values:
.TP 4
.B 0

.B 1
Operation failed. This is returned for almost all failures.
(EXIT_FAILURE)
.TP
.B 64
Invalid parameter given. (EX_USAGE)
