dbox
====

dbox is Dovecot's own high-performance mailbox format. The original version was
introduced in v1.0 alpha4, but since then it has been completely redesigned in
v1.1 series and improved even further in v2.0.

dbox can be used in two ways:

 1. *single-dbox* ('sdbox' in <mail location> [MailLocation.txt]): One message
    per file, similar to <Maildir> [MailboxFormat.Maildir.txt]. For backwards
    compatibility,'dbox' is an alias to 'sdbox' in <mail_location>
    [MailLocation.txt].
 2. *multi-dbox* ('mdbox' in <mail location> [MailLocation.txt]): Multiple
    messages per file, but unlike <mbox> [MailboxFormat.mbox.txt] multiple
    files per mailbox.

One of the main reasons for dbox's high performance is that it uses Dovecot's
index files as the only storage for message flags and keywords. This means that
indexes don't have to be "synchronized". Dovecot trusts that they're always
up-to-date (unless it sees that something is clearly broken).

dbox has a feature for transparently moving message data to an alternate
storage area. See <Alternate storage> [MailboxFormat.dbox.txt] below.

dbox storage is extensible, so in future there will be other extensions. Some
things that are planned:

 * Single instance attachment storage. If multiple mailboxes/users have the
   same attachment, it's stored only once in disk.

Layout
------

By default, the dbox filesystem layout will be as follows. Data which isn't the
actual message content is stored in a layout common to both *single-dbox* and
*multi-dbox*:

 * <mail location root>'/mailboxes/INBOX/dbox-Mails/dovecot.index*' - Index
   files for INBOX
 * <mail location root>'/mailboxes/foo/dbox-Mails/dovecot.index*' - Index files
   for mailbox "foo"
 * <mail location root>'/mailboxes/foo/bar/dbox-Mails/dovecot.index*' - Index
   files for mailbox "foo/bar"
 * <mail location root>'/dovecot.mailbox.log*' - Mailbox changelog
 * <mail location root>'/subscriptions' - subscribed mailboxes list
 * <mail location root>'/dovecot-uidvalidity*' - IMAP UID validity

Note that with dbox the Index files actually contain significant data which is
held nowhere else. Index files for both *single-dbox* and *multi-dbox* contain
message flags and keywords. For *multi-dbox*, the index file also contains the
map_uids which link (via the "map index") to the actual message data. This data
cannot be automatically recreated, so it is important that Index files are
treated with the same care as message data files.

Index files can be stored in a different location by using the INDEX parameter
in the mail location specification. If the INDEX parameter is specified, it
will make Dovecot look for the Index files as follows:

 * <INDEX location>'/mailboxes/INBOX/dbox-Mails/dovecot.index*' - Index files
   for INBOX
 * <INDEX location>'/mailboxes/foo/dbox-Mails/dovecot.index*' - Index files for
   mailbox "foo"
 * <INDEX location>'/mailboxes/foo/bar/dbox-Mails/dovecot.index*' - Index files
   for mailbox "foo/bar"

Actual message content is stored differently depending on whether it is
*single-dbox* or *multi-dbox*.

Under *single-dbox* we have:

 * <mail location root>'/mailboxes/INBOX/dbox-Mails/u.*' - Numbered files
   ('u.1','u.2', ...) each containing one message of INBOX
 * <mail location root>'/mailboxes/foo/dbox-Mails/u.*' - Files each containing
   one message for mailbox "foo"
 * <mail location root>'/mailboxes/foo/bar/dbox-Mails/u.*' - Files each
   containing one message for for mailbox "foo/bar"

Under *multi-dbox* we have:

 * <mail location root>'/storage/dovecot.map.index*' - "Map index" containing a
   record for each message stored
 * <mail location root>'/storage/m.*' - Numbered files ('m.1', 'm.2', ...) each
   containing one or multiple messages

With Dovecot versions 2.0.4 and later, setting the INDEX parameter sets the
location of the "map index" as well as the location of the mailbox indexes. So
this would make the "map index" be stored as follows:

 * <INDEX location>'/storage/dovecot.map.index*' - "Map index" containing a
   record for each message stored

Multi-dbox
----------

You can enable multi-dbox with:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
mail_location = mdbox:~/mdbox
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The directory layout (under '~/mdbox/') is:

 * '~/mdbox/storage/' contains the actual mail data for all mailboxes
 * '~/mdbox/mailboxes/' contains directories for mailboxes and their index
   files

The storage directory has files:

 * 'dovecot.map.index*' files contain the "map index"
 * 'm.*' files contain the mail data

Each m.* file contains one or more messages. 'mdbox_rotate_size' setting can be
used to configure how large the files can grow.

The map index contains a record for each message:

 * map_uid: Unique growing 32 bit number for the message.
 * refcount: 16 bit reference counter for this message. Each time the message
   is copied the refcount is increased.
 * file_id: File number containing the message. For example if file_id=5, the
   message is in file 'm.5'.
 * offset: Offset to message within the file.
 * size: Space used by the message in the file, including all metadata.

Mailbox indexes refer to messages only using map_uids. This allows messages to
be moved to different files by updating only the map index. Copying is done
simply by appending a new record to mailbox index containing the existing
map_uid and increasing its refcount. If refcount grows over 32768, currently
Dovecot gives an error message. It's unlikely anyone really wants to copy the
same message that many times.

Expunging a message only decreases the message's refcount. The space is later
freed in "purge" step. This is typically done in a nightly cronjob when there's
less disk I/O activity. The purging first finds all files that have refcount=0
mails. Then it goes through each file and copies the refcount>0 mails to other
mdbox files (to the same files as where newly saved messages would also go),
updates the map index and finally deletes the original file. So there is never
any overwriting or file truncation.

The purging can be invoked explicitly running <doveadm purge>
[Tools.Doveadm.Purge.txt].

There are several safety features built into dbox to avoid losing messages or
their state if map index or mailbox index gets corrupted:

 * Each message has a 128 bit globally unique identifier (GUID). The GUID is
   saved to message metadata in m.* files and also to mailbox indexes. This
   allows Dovecot to find messages even if map index gets corrupted.
 * Whenever index file is rewritten, the old index is renamed to
   'dovecot.index.backup'. If the main index becomes corrupted, this backup
   index is used to restore flags and figure out what messages belong to the
   mailbox.
 * Initial mailbox where message was saved to is stored in the message metadata
   in m.* files. So if all indexes get lost, the messages are put to their
   initial mailboxes. This is better than placing everything into a single
   mailbox.

Alternate storage
-----------------

Unlike Maildir, with dbox the message file names don't change. This makes it
possible to support storing files in multiple directories or mount points. dbox
supports looking up files from "altpath" if they're not found from the primary
path. This means that it's possible to move older mails that are rarely
accessed to cheaper (slower) storage.

To enable this functionality, use the 'ALT' parameter in the mail location. For
example, specifying the mail location as:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
mail_location = mdbox:/var/vmail/%d/%n:ALT=/altstorage/vmail/%d/%n
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

will make Dovecot look for message data first under '/var/vmail/%d/%n'
("primary storage"), and if it is not found there it will look under
'/altstorage/vmail/%d/%n' ("alternate storage") instead.

Keep the unmounted '/altstorage' directory permissions such that Dovecot mail
processes can't create directories under it (e.g. root:root 0755). This way if
the alt storage isn't mounted for some reason, Dovecot won't think that all the
messages in alt storage were deleted and lose their flags.

When messages are moved from primary storage to alternate storage, only the
actual message data (stored in files 'u.*' under *single-dbox* and 'm.*' under
*multi-dbox*) is moved to alternate storage; everything else remains in the
primary storage.

Message data can be moved from primary storage to alternate storage using
<doveadm altmove> [Tools.Doveadm.Altmove.txt].

The granularity at which data is moved to alternate storage is individual
messages. This is true even for *multi-dbox* when multiple messages are stored
in a single 'm.*' storage file. If individual messages from an 'm.*' storage
file need to be moved to alternate storage, the message data is written out to
a different 'm.*' storage file (either new or existing) in the alternate
storage area and the "map index" updated accordingly.

Alternate storage is completely transparent at the IMAP/POP level. Users
accessing mail through IMAP or POP cannot normally tell if any given message is
stored in primary storage or alternate storage. Conceivably users might be able
to measure a performance difference; the point is that there is no IMAP/POP
command which could be used to expose this information. It is entirely possible
to have a mail folder which contains a mix of messages stored in primary
storage and alternate storage.

An upshot of the way alternate storage works is that any given storage file
('mailboxes/<folder>/dbox-Mails/u.*' (sdbox) or 'storage/m.*' (mdbox)) can only
appear *either* in the primary storage area *or* the alternate storage area but
not both — if the corresponding file appears in both areas then there is an
inconsistency.
