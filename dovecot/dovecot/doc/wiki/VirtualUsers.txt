Virtual Users
=============

There are many ways to configure Dovecot to use virtual users. If you have no
idea how you want your users to be configured, select some <HOWTO> [HowTo.txt]
and follow its instructions.

Users are often categorized as being either system users (in '/etc/passwd') or
virtual users (not in '/etc/passwd'). However from Dovecot's point of view
there isn't much of a difference between them. If a <passwd>
[AuthDatabase.Passwd.txt] lookup and a <SQL> [AuthDatabase.SQL.txt] lookup
return the same <userdb> [UserDatabase.txt] information, Dovecot's behavior is
identical.

Password and user databases
---------------------------

Dovecot supports many different <password databases> [PasswordDatabase.txt] and
<user databases> [UserDatabase.txt]. With virtual users the most commonly used
ones are <LDAP> [AuthDatabase.LDAP.txt], <SQL> [AuthDatabase.SQL.txt] and
<passwd-file> [AuthDatabase.PasswdFile.txt]. The databases usually contain the
following information:

 * Username
 * Password
 * UNIX User ID (UID) and primary UNIX Group ID (GID)
 * Home directory and/or mail location

Usernames and domains
---------------------

Dovecot doesn't care much about domains in usernames. IMAP and POP3 protocols
currently have no concept of "domain", so the username is just something that
shows up in your logs and maybe in some configuration, but they have no direct
functionality.

So although Dovecot makes it easier to handle "user@domain" style usernames
(eg. %n and %d <variables> [Variables.txt]), nothing breaks if you use for
example "domain%user" style usernames instead. However some <authentication
mechanisms> [Authentication.Mechanisms.txt] do have an explicit support for
realms (pretty much the same as domains). If those mechanisms are used, the
username is changed to be "user@realm".

And of course there's no need to have domains at all in the usernames.

Passwords
---------

The password can be in <any format that Dovecot supports>
[Authentication.PasswordSchemes.txt], but you need to tell the format to
Dovecot because it won't try to guess it. The SQL and LDAP configuration files
have the 'default_pass_scheme' setting for this. If you have passwords in
multiple formats, or the passdb doesn't have such a setting, you'll need to
prefix each password with "{<scheme>}", for example "{PLAIN}plaintext-password"
or "{PLAIN-MD5}1a1dc91c907325c69271ddf0c944bc72".

UNIX UIDs
---------

The most important thing you need to understand is that *Dovecot doesn't access
the users' mails as the /dovecot/ user*! So *don't* put /dovecot/ into the
/mail/ group, and don't make mails owned by the /dovecot/ user. That will only
make your Dovecot installation less secure.

So, if not the /dovecot/ user, what then? You can decide that yourself. You can
create, for example, one /vmail/ user which owns all the mails, or you can
assign a separate UID for each user. See <UserIds#mailusers> [UserIds.txt] for
more information about different ways to allocate UIDs for users.

UNIX GIDs
---------

Unless you're using <shared mailboxes> [SharedMailboxes.txt] and multiple UIDs,
it doesn't really matter what GIDs you use. You can, for example, use a single
GID for all users, or create a separate GID for each user. See <UserIds#gids>
[UserIds.txt] for more information.

Home directories
----------------

Some people are opposed to the idea of virtual users having home directories,
but no matter what you call it, it's a good idea to have a directory where
user-specific configuration and other state is stored. See
<VirtualUsers.Home.txt> more information.

Mail location
-------------

The userdb can return the 'mail' <field> [UserDatabase.txt] to override the
default 'mail_location' setting. Usually you shouldn't need this.

Examples
========

Dynamic passwd-file locations
-----------------------------

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
mail_location = maildir:/home/%d/%n/Maildir
passdb {
  driver = passwd-file
  args = username_format=%n /home/%d/etc/shadow
}
userdb {
  driver = passwd-file
  args = username_format=%n /home/%d/etc/passwd
}
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the above examples users are expected to log in as "user@domain". Their mail
is kept in their home directory at '/home/<domain>/<username>/Maildir'.

The usernames in the passwd and shadow files are expected to contain only the
user part, no domain. This is because the path itself already contained %d to
specify the domain. If you want the files to contain full user@domain names,
you can use 'username_format=%u'.

static userdb
=============

Many people store only usernames and passwords in their database and don't want
to deal with UIDs or GIDs. In that case the easiest way to get Dovecot running
is to use the <static userdb> [UserDatabase.Static.txt]:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir
passdb {
  driver = pam
}
userdb {
  driver = static
  args = uid=vmail gid=vmail home=/var/mail/virtual/%d/%n
}
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This makes Dovecot look up the mails from
'/var/mail/virtual/<domain>/<user>/Maildir/' directory, which should be owned
by vmail user and vmail group.

Existing virtual user management software
-----------------------------------------

 * VPopMail [http://www.inter7.com/vpopmail/]: Dovecot <supports VPopMail
   directly> [AuthDatabase.VPopMail.txt].
 * Linuxconf [http://www.solucorp.qc.ca/linuxconf/]: See
   <Migration.Linuxconf.txt>
 * Also see the <HowTo.txt> page
