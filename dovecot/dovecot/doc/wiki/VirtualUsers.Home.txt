Home Directories for Virtual Users
==================================

Home directory is a per-user directory where *Dovecot can save user-specific
files*.

 * Dovecot's home directories have nothing to do with system users' home
   directories.
 * It's irrelevant if it's under '/home/' or '/var/mail/' or wherever.
 * If you have trouble understanding this, mentally replace all mentions of
   "home directory" to "mail user's private state directory".

And in particular:

 * Never configure your userdb to return the same home directory for multiple
   users!
 * Home directory must be an absolute path, don't even try to use relative
   paths!

Some uses for home directory are:

 * By default <Sieve> [Pigeonhole.Sieve.txt] scripts are in user's home
   directory.
 * Duplicate mail check database is in user's home directory. Suppression of
   duplicate rejects/vacations won't work if home directory isn't specified.
 * Debugging: If an imap or pop3 process crashes, the core file is written to
   the user's home directory.

Home vs. mail directory
-----------------------

Home directory shouldn't be the same as mail directory. It's possible to do
that, but you might run into trouble with it sooner or later. Some problems
with this are:

 * Non-mailbox files may show up as mailboxes.
 * Or user just might not be able to create mailbox with wanted name, because
   there already exists a conflicting file
    * e.g. with Maildir if you have '.dovecot.sieve' file, user can't create a
      mailbox called "dovecot.sieve" (i.e. "dovecot" mailbox that has a "sieve"
      child)
 * And vice versa: If user creates "dovecot.sieve" mailbox, Dovecot will
   probably start logging all kinds of errors because the mailbox directory
   isn't a valid <Sieve> [Pigeonhole.Sieve.txt] script.
 * If you ever intend to migrate to another mailbox format, it's much more
   easier to do if you can have both old and new mail directories under the
   user's home directory.

Ways to set up home directory
-----------------------------

The directory layouts for home and mail directories could look like one of
these (in the preferred order):

 1. Mail directory under home, for example: home='/var/vmail/domain/user/'
    mail='/var/vmail/domain/user/mail/'
 2. Completely distinct home and mail directories:
    home='/home/virtual/domain/user/' mail='/var/vmail/domain/user/'
 3. Home directory under mail, for example:
     * Maildir: home='/var/vmail/domain/user/home/'
       mail='/var/vmail/domain/user/'
     * mbox: There's really no good and safe way to do it.
 4. The home directory is the same as the mail directory.

If for example home='/var/vmail/domain/user/'
mail='/var/vmail/domain/user/mail/', set:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
mail_home = /var/vmail/%d/%n
mail_location = maildir:~/mail
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples

LDAP with relative directory paths
----------------------------------

If your LDAP database uses e.g. 'mailDirectory = domain/user/', you can use it
as a base for home directory:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
user_attrs = .., mailDirectory=home=/var/vmail/%$
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then just use 'mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir'.
