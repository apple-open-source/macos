ManageSieve Configuration
=========================

*NOTE*: If you have used the Sieve plugin before and you have '.dovecot.sieve'
files in user directories, you are advised to *make a backup first*. Although
theManageSieve daemon takes care to move these files to the Sieve storage
before it is substituted with a symbolic link, this is not a very well tested
operation, meaning that there is a possibility that existing Sieve scripts get
lost.

The ManageSieve configuration consists of ManageSieve protocol settings and
<Sieve interpreter> [Pigeonhole.Sieve.txt]-related settings. The Sieve
interpreter settings are shared with settings of the <Sieve plugin>
[Pigeonhole.Sieve.txt] for Dovecot's <Local Delivery Agent (LDA)> [LDA.txt] and
<LMTP.txt>. First, the ManageSieve protocol settings are outlined and then the
relevant Sieve settings are described.

Protocol Configuration
----------------------

Along with all other binaries that Dovecot uses, the managesieve and
managesieve-login binaries are installed during 'make install' of the
<Pigeonhole.txt> package. The only thing you need to do to activate the
ManageSieve protocol support in Dovecot is to add 'sieve' to the 'protocols='
configuration line in your dovecot.conf. The managesieve daemon will listen on
port 4190 by default. As the implementation of the managesieve daemon is
largely based on the original IMAP implementation, it is very similar in terms
of configuration. In addition to most mail daemon config settings, the
managesieve daemon accepts a few more. The following settings can be configured
in the 'protocol managesieve' section:

managesieve_max_line_length = 65536:
  The maximum ManageSieve command line length in bytes. This setting is
  directly borrowed from IMAP. But, since long command lines are very unlikely
  withManageSieve, changing this will not be very useful.

managesieve_logout_format = bytes=%i/%o:
  Specifies the string pattern used to compose the logout message of an
  authenticated session. The following substitutions are available:

:
  ---%<-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  %i - total number of bytes read from client
  %o - total number of bytes sent to client
  ---%<-----------------------------------------------------------------------

managesieve_implementation_string = Dovecot Pigeonhole:
  To fool ManageSieve clients that are focused on CMU's timesieved you can
  specify the IMPLEMENTATION capability that the Dovecot reports to clients
  (e.g. 'Cyrus timsieved v2.2.13').

managesieve_max_compile_errors = 5:
  The maximum number of compile errors that are returned to the client upon 
  script upload or script verification.

managesieve_sieve_capability =, managesieve_notify_capability = :
  Respectively the SIEVE and NOTIFY capabilities reported by the ManageSieve
  service before authentication. If left unassigned, these will be assigned
  dynamically according to what the Sieve interpreter supports by default
  (after login this may differ depending on the authenticated user).

Sieve Interpreter Configuration
-------------------------------

The part of the <Sieve interpreter> [Pigeonhole.Sieve.txt] configuration that
is relevant forManageSieve mainly consists of the settings that specify where
the user's scripts are stored and where the active script is located.
TheManageSieve service primarily uses the following Sieve interpreter settings
in the 'plugin' section of the Dovecot configuration:

sieve_dir = ~/sieve:
  This specifies the path to the directory where the uploaded scripts are
  stored. Scripts are stored as separate files with extension '.sieve'. All
  other files are ignored when scripts are listed by aManageSieve client. The
  Sieve interpreter also uses this setting to locate the user's personal
  scripts for use with the Sieve include extension
  [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sieve-include]. A storage location
  specified by 'sieve_dir' is always generated automatically if it does not
  exist (as far as the system permits the user to do so; no root privileges are
  used). This is similar to the behavior of the mail daemons regarding the
  'mail_location' configuration.

sieve = ~/.dovecot.sieve:
  This specifies the location of the symbolic link pointing to the active
  script in the Sieve storage directory. The Sieve interpreter uses this
  setting to locate the main script file that needs to be executed upon
  delivery. When usingManageSieve, this is a symbolic link managed by the
  ManageSieve service. ManageSieve thereby determines which script (if any) in
  the 'sieve_dir' directory is executed for incoming messages. If a regular
  file already exists at the location specified by the 'sieve' setting, it is
  moved to the 'sieve_dir' location before the symbolic link is installed. It
  is renamed to 'dovecot.orig.sieve' and therefore listed as `dovecot.orig' by
  aManageSieve client.

Quota Support
-------------

By default, users can manage an unlimited number of Sieve scripts on the server
throughManageSieve. However, ManageSieve can be configured to enforce limits on
the number of personal Sieve scripts per user and/or the amount of disk storage
used by these scripts. The maximum size of individual uploaded scripts is
dictated by the configuration of the <Sieve interpreter>
[Pigeonhole.Sieve.txt]. The limits are configured in the plugin section of the
Dovecot configuration as follows:

sieve_max_script_size = 1M:
  The maximum size of a Sieve script.

sieve_quota_max_scripts = 0:
  The maximum number of personal Sieve scripts a single user can have.

sieve_quota_max_storage = 0:
  The maximum amount of disk storage a single user's scripts may occupy.

A value of 0 for these settings means that no limit is enforced.

Examples
--------

The following provides example configurations for ManageSieve in dovecot.conf
for the various versions. Only sections relevant toManageSieve and the Sieve
plugin are shown. Refer to 20-managesieve.conf in
doc/dovecot/example-config/conf.d, but don't forget to add 'sieve' to the
'protocols' setting if you use it.

Proxy
-----

Like Dovecot's imapd, the ManageSieve login daemon supports proxying to
multiple backend servers. Although the underlying code is copied from the imapd
sources for the most part, it has someManageSieve-specifics that have not seen
much testing. The <proxy configuration wiki page>
[PasswordDatabase.ExtraFields.Proxy.txt] for POP3 and IMAP should apply to
ManageSieve as well.

Migration from Dovecot v1.x ManageSieve
---------------------------------------

The following has changed since the ManageSieve releases for Dovecot v1.x:

 * For Dovecot v1.0 and v1.1, the 'sieve_dir' setting used by ManageSieve was
   called 'sieve_storage'. Also, the 'sieve' and 'sieve_storage' settings were
   located inside the 'protocol managesieve' section of the configuration. As
   per Dovecot v1.2 these settings are shared with the Sieve plugin and located
   in the 'plugin' section of the configuration. Make sure you have updated the
   name of the 'sieve_dir' setting and the location of both these settings if
   you are upgrading fromManageSieve for Dovecot v1.0/v1.1.
 * Pigeonhole ManageSieve does not use the 'mail_location' configuration as a
   fall-back anymore to determine a default location for storing Sieve scripts.
   It always uses the 'sieve_dir' setting, with default value '~/sieve'.
 * The Pigeonhole ManageSieve service now binds to TCP port 4190 by default due
   to the IANA port assignment for theManageSieve service. When upgrading from
   v1.x, this should be taken into account. For a smooth transition, the
   service can be configured manually to listen on both port 2000 and port
   4190, as demonstrated in the example section.
 * The Dovecot configuration now calls the ManageSieve protocol 'sieve' instead
   of 'managesieve' because it is registered as such with IANA. The binaries
   and the services are still called 'managesieve' and 'managesieve-login'. The
   example section demonstrates how this affects the configuration.
