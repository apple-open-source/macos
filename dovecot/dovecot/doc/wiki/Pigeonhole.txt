Pigeonhole Sieve support
========================

Introduction
------------

The <Pigeonhole project> [Pigeonhole.txt] provides mail filtering facilities at
time of final message delivery using the Sieve (RFC 5228
[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5228.txt]) language. By writing Sieve scripts,
users can customize how messages are delivered, e.g. whether they are forwarded
or stored in special folders. The Sieve language is meant to be simple,
extensible and system independent. And, unlike most other mail filtering script
languages, it does not allow users to execute arbitrary programs. This is
particularly useful to prevent virtual users from having full access to the
mail store. The intention of the language is to make it impossible for users to
do anything more complex (and dangerous) than write simple mail filters. See
Sieve wiki [http://sieve.info/] for more comprehensive information about the
Sieve language itself.

Installation
------------

Refer to the <installation page> [Pigeonhole.Installation.txt].

Configuration and Use
---------------------

The Pigeonhole package provides the following items:

 * The <Sieve interpreter plugin> [Pigeonhole.Sieve.txt] for Dovecot's <Local
   Delivery Agent (LDA)> [LDA.txt] or its <LMTP.txt> server: This facilitates
   the actual Sieve filtering upon delivery.
 * The <ManageSieve Service> [Pigeonhole.ManageSieve.txt]: This implements the
   ManageSieve protocol through which users can remotely manage Sieve scripts
   on the server.
