Lucene Full Text Search Indexing
================================

Requires Dovecot v2.1+ to work properly.

Dovecot builds only a single Lucene index for all mailboxes. The Lucene indexes
are stored in 'lucene-indexes/' directory under the mail root index directory
(e.g.'~/Maildir/lucene-indexes/').

Configuration
-------------

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
mail_plugins = $mail_plugins fts fts_lucene

plugin {
  fts = lucene
  #fts_lucene = <fts-lucene settings>
}
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fts-lucene settings include:

 * whitespace_chars=<chars>: List of characters that are translated to
   whitespace. You may want to use "@." so that e.g. in
   "'first.last@example.org'" it won't be treated as a single word, but rather
   you can search separately for "first", "last" and "example".
 * default_language=<lang>: Default stemming language to use for mails. The
   default is english. Requires that Dovecot is built with libstemmer, which
   also limits the languages that are supported.
 * textcat_conf=<path> textcat_dir=<path>: Is specified, enable guessing the
   stemming language for emails and search keywords. This is a little bit
   problematic in practice, since indexing and searching languages may differ
   and may not find even exact words because they stem differently.
