Finishing Basic Configuration
=============================

Unless you're going to have only virtual users and you don't care about their
passwords,*switch back to disable_plaintext_only = yes* and <set up SSL>
[SSL.txt].

Plaintext authentication is still allowed from localhost, so you can have your
webmail application to connect to Dovecot without using SSL or even having to
configure it.
