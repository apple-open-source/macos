Cyrus
=====

*WARNING: Badly done migration will cause your IMAP and/or POP3 clients to
re-download all mails. Read <Migration.txt> page first carefully.*

For POP3 UIDL compatibility, use one of:

Cyrus versions up to v2.1.3:
  ---%<-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  #  Cyrus (old format - up to v2.1.3)
  pop3_uidl_format = %u
  ---%<-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Cyrus versions v2.1.4 and newer:
  ---%<-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  #  Cyrus (new format - v2.1.4 and above)
  pop3_uidl_format = %v.%u
  ---%<-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mail storage migration
----------------------

There exists several scripts which can be used to convert Cyrus mail storages
to Maildir. They all read the Cyrus mail directories directly, so they don't
need a running Cyrus installation.

 * cyrus2dovecot [http://cyrus2dovecot.sw.fu-berlin.de/] (by Freie Universität
   Berlin) allows you to perform a server transition which is fully transparent
   to both POP and IMAP users, as virtually all available metadata is preserved
   during the conversion. This includes message UIDs, INTERNALDATEs, IMAP
   folder subscriptions, the UIDVALIDITY and UIDNEXT values for each folder, as
   well as all IMAP flags (including the first 26 user-defined
   keywords).Cyrus2Dovecot is supposed to work with all Cyrus releases up to
   (at least) version 2.3.x. So far, it has been tested with Cyrus 1.4, 2.1.18,
   2.2.12, and 2.3.12p2.
 * cyrus2courier [http://madness.at/projects/] is Dovecot-compatible. A
   non-official v1.6ts release [http://dovecot.org/tools/] works up to Cyrus
   v2.3.9. It should be able to preserve message UIDs, INTERNALDATEs, flags and
   the first 26 keywords. It works only with the supported Cyrus versions, so
   if Cyrus once again changes its internal formats this tool might break
   again.
 * cyrus2maildir.py [http://www.majid.info/mylos/weblog/2006/03/08-1.html] (for
   Cyrus v2.2) preserves (only) INTERNALDATEs and \Seen flags.
 * cyrus2dovecot [http://trukenmueller.de/cyrus2dovecot] (by Trukenmüller)
   doesn't preserve timestamps or flags.

You can also use imapsync, as described in the <Migration.txt> page, but you'll
lose all the message UIDs then.

Migration of passwords
----------------------

Some installations of Cyrus store passwords using /Cyrus/ SASL (not to be
confused with other SASL implementations).  Passwords are stored in
'/etc/sasldb2', in Berkeley DB format. On Debian, the command 'db4.2_dump -p
/etc/sasldb2' may allow you access to the passwords.  This could be
incorporated into a script to copy the passwords to an LDAP directory for use
with other mail servers (e.g. Dovecot).

For Fedora Core 3 (and probably other versions) the command is just 'db_dump -p
/etc/sasldb2'.
