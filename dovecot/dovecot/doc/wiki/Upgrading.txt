Upgrading between micro versions
================================

(For example v1.0.x -> v1.0.y or v1.1.x -> v1.1.y)

The NEWS file [http://dovecot.org/doc/NEWS] contains all the important changes
marked with "*" character. Read them to see if there is anything that concerns
you. In general all the changes try to preserve backwards compatibility, but
some changes which are meant to improve the stability and correctness of the
configuration could mean breaking some existing installations. And that may be
a good thing, since it can expose problems which could otherwise show up as
random errors.

Upgrading between other versions
================================

 * <v0.99.x to v1.0> [Upgrading.1.0.txt]
 * <v1.0 to v1.1> [Upgrading.1.1.txt]
 * <v1.1 to v1.2> [Upgrading.1.2.txt]
 * <v1.2 to v2.0> [Upgrading.2.0.txt]
