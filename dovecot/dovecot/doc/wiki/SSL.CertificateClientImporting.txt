SSL certificate importing to clients
====================================

You may import either the server's self-signed certificate or the CA
certificate (see <SSL.CertificateCreation.txt>).

Windows XP
----------

Import to Trusted Root Certification Authorities store: 
http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/sag_cmprocsimport.mspx?mfr=true

Outlook and Outlook Express uses the Windows's certificate store.

Mac OS X
--------

 * Doubleclick the certificate
 * Keychain should open
 * Add the certificate to X509 Anchors keychain

Apple Mail uses the OS X's certificate store.

Thunderbird
-----------

Preferences -> Privacy -> Security -> View Certificates -> Authorities ->
Import -> Trust this CA to identify email users.

Opera Mail
----------

Preferences -> Advanced > Security > Certificates > Import certificate file.

Evolution
---------

Preferences -> Certificates -> Authorities -> Import -> Trust this CA to
identify email users.

Pine
----

http://www.madboa.com/geek/pine-ssl/ tells a story how to do this. Basically it
seems to be:

 1. Find out your OPENSSLDIR: 'openssl version -d'
 2. Get a hash of your certificate: 'openssl x509 -in cert.pem -hash -noout'
 3. Copy the certificate to '$OPENSSLDIR/certs/$hash.0'

This probably works only for self-signed certificates.

KMail
-----

Instructions needed.

Claws Mail
----------

Configuration -> Edit accounts (Choose here your's one and press 'Edit'-button)
