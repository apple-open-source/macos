Proxying
========

Dovecot supports proxying IMAP, POP3 and <LMTP.txt> connections to other hosts.
The proxying can be done for all users, or only for some specific users. There
are two ways to do the authentication:

 1. Forward the password to the remote server and let it perform the actual
    authentication. This requires that the client uses only plaintext
    authentication.
 2. Let Dovecot proxy perform the authentication and login to remote server
    using the proxy's <master password> [MasterPassword.txt]. This allows
    client to use also non-plaintext authentication.

The proxy is configured pretty much the same way as <login referrals>
[PasswordDatabase.ExtraFields.Host.txt], with the addition of 'proxy' field.
The common fields to use for both proxying ways are:

 * 'proxy' and 'proxy_maybe': Enables the proxying. Either one of these fields
   is required.
    * 'proxy_maybe' can be used to implement "automatic proxying". If the proxy
      destination matches the current connection, the user gets logged in
      normally instead of being proxied. If the same happens with 'proxy', the
      login fails with "Proxying loops" error.
 * 'host=s': The destination server's *IP address*. This field is required.
 * 'port=s': The destination server's port. The default is 143 with IMAP and
   110 with POP3.
 * 'destuser=s': Tell client to use a different username when logging in.
 * 'proxy_timeout': Abort connection after this many seconds.

You can use SSL/TLS connection to destination server by returning:

 * ssl=yes: Use SSL and require a valid verified remote certificate. *WARNING:
   Unless used carefully, this is an insecure setting!* Currently the host name
   isn't checked in any way against the certificate's CN. The only way to use
   this securely is to only use and allow your own private CA's certs, anything
   else is exploitable by a man-in-the-middle attack.
 * ssl=any-cert: Use SSL, but don't require a valid remote certificate.
 * starttls: Use STARTTLS command instead of doing SSL handshake immediately
   after connected.
 * starttls=any-cert: Combine starttls and ssl=any-cert.

The destination servers don't need to be running Dovecot, but you should make
sure that the Dovecot proxy doesn't advertise more capabilities than the
destination server can handle. For IMAP you can do this by changing
'imap_capability' setting. For POP3 you'll have to modify Dovecot's sources for
now ('src/pop3/capability.h'). Dovecot also automatically sends updated
untagged CAPABILITY reply if it detects that the remote server has different
capabilities than what it already advertised to the client, but some clients
simply ignore the updated CAPABILITY reply.

Password forwarding
-------------------

Make sure that the authentication succeeds with any given password. You can do
this by returning empty password and 'nopassword' field.

Master password
---------------

This way of forwarding requires the destination server to support master user
feature. The users will be normally authenticated in the proxy and the common
proxy fields are returned, but you'll need to return two fields specially:

 * 'master=s': This contains the master username (e.g. "proxy"). It's used as
   SASL auhentication ID.
    * Alternatively you could return 'destuser=user*master' and set
      'auth_master_user_separator = *'.
 * 'pass=s': This field contains the master user's password.

See <Authentication.MasterUsers.txt> for more information how to configure
this.

Example password forwarding SQL configuration
---------------------------------------------

Create the SQL table:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE proxy (
  user varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  host varchar(16) default NULL,
  destuser varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
  PRIMARY KEY  (user)
);
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insert data to SQL corresponding your users.

Working data could look like this:
+------+-------------+-----------------+
| user | host        | destuser        |
+------+-------------+-----------------+
| john | 192.168.0.1 |                 |
+------+-------------+-----------------+
| joe  | 192.168.0.2 | joe@example.com |
+------+-------------+-----------------+

The important parts of 'dovecot.conf':

# If you want to trade a bit of security for higher performance, change these
settings:
service imap-login {
  service_count = 0
}
service pop3-login {
  service_count = 0
}

# If you are not moving mailboxes between hosts on a daily basis you can
# use authentication cache pretty safely.
