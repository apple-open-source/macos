Quick Configuration
===================

If you just want to get Dovecot running with typical configuration in a typical
environment, here's what you'll have to do:

Configuration file
------------------

If you compiled and installed Dovecot from sources, Dovecot has installed only
a '/usr/local/etc/dovecot/README' file, which contains the path to the
installed example configuration files, usually
'/usr/local/share/doc/dovecot/example-config'. Copy the 'dovecot.conf' file and
'conf.d' directory from the example-config directory into
'/usr/local/etc/dovecot/'. Prebuilt packages usually install the configuration
files directly into '/etc/dovecot/'.
 You'll find the path by running 'doveconf -n | head -n 1'.
 It's a good idea to read through all the files and see what settings you might
want to change.

Authentication
--------------

You'll probably be using <PAM> [PasswordDatabase.PAM.txt] authentication. See
the <PAM> [PasswordDatabase.PAM.txt] page for how to configure it. A typical
configuration with Linux would be to create '/etc/pam.d/dovecot' which
contains:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
auth    required        pam_unix.so
account required        pam_unix.so
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're using something else, see <password databases> [PasswordDatabase.txt]
and <user databases> [UserDatabase.txt].

Mail Location
-------------

You can let Dovecot do its automatic mail location detection, but if that
doesn't work, you can set the location manually in 'mail_location' setting. See
<MailLocation.txt> for more information.

Mbox
----

Make sure that all software accessing the mboxes are using the same locking
methods in the same order. The order is important to prevent deadlocking. From
Dovecot's side you can change these from 'mbox_read_locks' and
'mbox_write_locks' settings. See <MboxLocking.txt> for more information.

If you're using '/var/mail/' directory for INBOXes, you may need to set
'mail_privileged_group = mail' so Dovecot can create dotlocks there.

For better performance you may want to set 'mbox_very_dirty_syncs = yes'
option.

Maildir
-------

For better performance you may want to set 'maildir_very_dirty_syncs = yes'
option.

Client Workarounds
------------------

Check 'imap_client_workarounds' and 'pop3_client_workarounds' and see if you
want to enable more of them than the defaults.

SSL and Plaintext Authentication
--------------------------------

If you intend to use SSL, set 'ssl_cert' and 'ssl_key' settings. Otherwise set
'ssl = no'. Easiest way to get SSL certificates built is to use Dovecot's
'doc/mkcert.sh' script. See <SSL.txt>.

By default Dovecot doesn't allow users to send passwords unencrypted to the
server. Usually if SSL is enabled, it's a good idea not to allow this. However,
if you don't offer SSL for some reason, you'll probably want to set
'disable_plaintext_auth = no'.

NFS
---

If you're using NFS or some other remote filesystem that's shared between
multiple computers, you should read <NFS.txt>.

Running
-------

See <RunningDovecot.txt> and <Logging.txt>.
