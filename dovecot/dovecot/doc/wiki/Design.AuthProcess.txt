Authentication process design
=============================

See <Design.Processes.txt> for an overview of how the authentication process
works.

There are four major classes in the code:

 * 'struct mech_module': Authentication mechanism
 * 'struct password_scheme': Password scheme
 * 'struct passdb_module': Password database
 * 'struct userdb_module': User database

There are many implementations for each of these, and it's simple to add more
of them. They can also be added as plugins, although the current plugin loading
code doesn't allow loading authentication mechanisms cleanly, and it's not
possible to add new credentials (see below).

The code flow usually goes like:

 * Dovecot-auth listens for new authentication client connections (the listener
   socket is created by master process and passed in MASTER_SOCKET_FD ->
   'main.c:main_init()' ->
   'auth-master-connection.c:auth_master_listener_add()')
 * A new authentication client connects via UNIX socket
   ('auth-master-connection.c:auth_master_listener_accept()' ->
   'auth-client-connection.c:auth_client_connection_create()')
 * Authentication client begins an authentication
   ('auth-client-connection.c:auth_client_input()' ->
   'auth_client_handle_line()' ->
   'auth-request-handler.c:auth_request_handler_auth_begin()' [ ->
   'auth-request.c:auth_request_new()'])
 * Authentication mechanism backend handles it ('mech->auth_initial()' and
   'mech->auth_continue()' in 'mech-*.c')
 * The mechanism looks up the password from passdb
   ('auth-request.c:auth_request_verify_plain()' and
   'auth_request_lookup_credentials()') and the password scheme code to
   verifies it ('password-scheme.c:password_verify()' and
   'password_generate()')
 * If user is logging in, the user information is looked up from the userdb
   ('auth-master-connection.c:master_input()' -> 'master_input_request()' ->
   'auth-request-handler.c:auth_request_handler_master_request()' ->
   'auth-request.c:auth_request_lookup_user()')
 * The authentication may begin new authentication requests even before the
   existing ones are finished.

It's also possible to request a userdb lookup directly, for example Dovecot's
<deliver> [LDA.txt] needs that. The code path for that goes
'auth-master-connection.c:master_input()' -> 'master_input_user()' ->
'auth-request.c:auth_request_lookup_user()'.

Authentication mechanisms
-------------------------

These are <SASL> [Sasl.txt] authentication mechanism implementations. See
<Authentication.Mechanisms.txt> for a list of mechanisms supported by Dovecot.

A new mechanism is created by filling a 'struct mech_module' (in 'mech.h') and
passing it to 'mech_register_module()'. The struct fields are:

mech_name:
  The public name of the mechanism. This is shown to clients in the IMAP, POP3
  and SMTP capability lists. If you create a new non-standard mechanism, please
  prefix it with "X-".

flags:
  Describes how secure the mechanism is. Also 'MECH_SEC_PRIVATE' flag specifies
  that the mechanism shouldn't be advertised in the capability list. This is
  currently used only for APOP mechanism, which is defined by the POP3 protocol
  itself.

passdb_need_plain:
  This mechanism uses passdb's 'verify_plain()' function to verify the
  password's validity. This means that the mechanism has access to the
  plaintext password. This is true only for plaintext mechanisms such as PLAIN
  and LOGIN. The main purpose of this flag is to make dovecot-auth complain at
  startup if there are no passdbs defined in the configuration file. Note that
  a configuration without any passdbs is valid with eg. GSSAPI mechanism which
  doesn't need a passdb at all.

passdb_need_credentials:
  This mechanism uses passdb's 'lookup_credentials()' function. See below for
  description of the credentials.

auth_new():
  Allocates a new 'struct auth_request'. Typically with more complex mechanisms
  it really allocates a 'struct <mech>_auth_request' which contains 'struct
  auth_request' as the first field, followed by mechanism-specific fields.

auth_initial(request, data, data_size):
  This begins the authentication, data and data_size containing the initial
  response sent by the client (decoded, not in base64). Call
  'request->callback()' once you're done (see below).

auth_continue(request, data, data_size):
  Continues the authentication. Works the same as 'auth_initial()'.

auth_free():
  Free the request. Usually all the memory allocations for the request should
  be allocated from 'request->pool', so you can use 'mech_generic_auth_free()'
  which simply frees the pool.

'auth_initial()' and 'auth_continue()' continue or finish the authentication by
calling 'request->callback()':

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
typedef void mech_callback_t(struct auth_request *request,
                             enum auth_client_result result,
                             const void *reply, size_t reply_size);
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'reply' and 'reply_size' contain the server's mechanism-specific reply to
the client. If there is no need to return anything (which is usually the case
with the "success" reply), the 'reply_size' can be 0. The 'result' parameter is
one of:

 * AUTH_CLIENT_RESULT_CONTINUE: Client can continue the authentication. The
   reply contains the mechanism-specific reply sent to the client.
 * AUTH_CLIENT_RESULT_SUCCESS: Authentication successful. The reply is usually
   empty.
 * AUTH_CLIENT_RESULT_FAILURE: Authentication failed. The reply is always
   ignored.

The 'request->callback()' should actually be called directly only for
continuation requests (a new function should probably be added for this as
well). For success and failure replies, you should instead use one of these
functions:

 * 'auth_request_success()'
 * 'auth_request_fail()'
 * 'auth_request_internal_failure()': Use this if you couldn't figure out if
   the authentication succeeded or failed, for example because passdb lookup
   returned internal failure.

SASL authentication in general works like:

 1. Client begins the authentication, optionally sending an "initial response",
    meaning some data that the mechanism sees in 'auth_initial()'.
     * Note that not all protocols support the initial response. For example
       IMAP supports it only if the server implements SASL-IR extension.
       Because of this mechanisms, such as PLAIN, support doing the
       authentication either in 'auth_initial()' or in 'auth_continue()'.
     * If the client initiates the authentication (ie. server's initial reply
       is empty, such as with PLAIN mechanism) you can use
       'mech_generic_auth_initial()' instead of implementing your own.
 2. Server processes the authentication request and replies back with
    'request->callback()'.
     * If the authentication failed, it's placed into 'auth_failures_buf'
       unless 'request->no_failure_delay=TRUE'. The failures are flushed from
       the buffer once every 2 seconds to clients and 'mechanism->auth_free()'
       is called.
     * If the authentication succeeded and
        * there is a master connection associated with the request (IMAP/POP3
          login), the authentication now waits for master connection to do a
          verification request. If this for some reason doesn't happen in
          'AUTH_REQUEST_TIMEOUT' seconds (3,5 mins), it's freed.
        * there isn't a master connection (SMTP AUTH), the authentication is
          freed immediately.
 3. Client processes the reply:
     * If the authentication continues, it sends back more data which is
       processed in 'auth_continue()'. Goto 2.
     * If the authentication failed, it's done.
 4. If the authentication succeeded, the client requests a login from the
    master process, which in turn requests verification from the auth process.
     * Besides verifying the authentication, dovecot-auth also does a userdb
       lookup to return the userdb information to master.
     * If the verification fails (normally because userdb lookup fails), the
       client gets "internal authentication failure"
     * If the verification succeeds, the user is now logged in
     * In either case, 'mechanism->auth_free()' is called now.

Credentials
-----------

Most of the non-plaintext mechanisms need to verify the authentication by using
a special hash of the user's password. So either the passdb credentials lookup
returns a plaintext password from which the hash can be created, or the hash
directly. The plaintext to hash conversion is done by calling
'password_generate' function of the password scheme.

Unfortunately the list of allowed credentials is currently hardcoded in 'enum
passdb_credentials'. The enum values are mapped to password scheme strings in
'passdb_credentials_to_str()'. Some day the enum will be removed so plugins can
add new mechanisms. Besides the mechanism-specific credentials, the enum
contains:

_PASSDB_CREDENTIALS_INTERNAL:
  I don't remember why this really exists. It should probably be called
  _PASSDB_CREDENTIALS_INVALID or something and used only by some asserts..

PASSDB_CREDENTIALS_PLAINTEXT:
  Request a plaintext password.

PASSDB_CREDENTIALS_CRYPT:
  Request the password in any scheme. This is especially useful if you only
  want to verify a user's existence in a passdb. Used by <static userdb>
  [UserDatabase.Static.txt] in userdb lookups.

Password schemes
----------------

'struct password_scheme' has fields:

name:
  Name of the scheme. This only shows up in configuration files and maybe in
  the passwords stored in passdb ("{scheme_name}password_hash").

password_verify(plaintext, password, user):
  Returns TRUE if 'password' hash matches the plaintext password given in
  'plaintext' parameter. If the password hash depends on the username (eg. with
  DIGEST-MD5), the 'user' parameter can also be used.

password_generate(plaintext, user):
  Returns the password hash for given plaintext password and username.

You can create a new password scheme by simply creating a 'struct
password_scheme' named '<module_name>_scheme', compiling a shared object and
placing it to '$moduledir/auth/password' directory.

Password databases
------------------

See <PasswordDatabase.txt> for a description of passdbs and a list of already
implemented ones.

'struct passdb_module' contains fields:

cache_key:
  A string containing <variables> [Variables.txt]. When expanded, it uniquely
  identifies a passdb lookup. This is '%u' when the passdb lookup validity
  depends only on the username. With more complex databases such as SQL and
  LDAP this is created dynamically based on the password query in the
  configuration file. If there are multiple variables, they should be separated
  so that their contents don't get mixed, for example '%u<TAB>%r<TAB>%l'.
  'auth_cache_parse_key()' can be used to easily create a cache key from a
  query string.

default_pass_scheme:
  The default scheme to use when it's not explicitly specified with a
  "{scheme}" prefix.

blocking:
  If TRUE, the lookup is done in dovecot-auth worker process. This should be
  used if the lookup may block.

iface.preinit(auth_passdb, args):
  Allocate 'struct passdb_module' and return it. This function is called before
  chrooting and before privileges are dropped from dovecot-auth process, so if
  should do things like read the configuration file.'auth_passdb' is typically
  used for getting a memory pool and looking up some global settings such as
  'auth_passdb->auth->verbose_debug'. 'args' contains the args parameter in
  configuration file.

iface.init(module, args):
  The privileges have been dropped before calling this. 'module' contains the
  structure returned by 'preinit()'. 'args' is the same as in 'preinit()'.
  Typically this function will do things like connect to the database.

iface.deinit(module):
  Close the connection to the password database and free all the memory you
  used.

iface.verify_plain(auth_request, password, callback):
  Check if the given plaintext password matches. 'auth_request->credentials =
  -1' always. When the verification is done, call the given callback with the
  result in 'result' parameter.

iface.lookup_credentials(auth_request, callback):
  Look up the password credentials. 'auth_request->credentials' contains the
  credentials that the mechanism wants. When the lookup is finished, call the
  given callback with the result in 'result' parameter, and if the lookup was
  successful the credentials in 'password' parameter.

Plaintext authentication mechanisms typically call 'verify_plain()', which is
possible to implement with all the passdbs. Non-plaintext mechanisms typically
call 'lookup_credentials()', which isn't possible to implement always (eg.
PAM). If it's not possible to implement 'lookup_credentials()', you can leave
the pointer to it NULL.

If the passdb uses connections to external services, it's preferred that they
use non-blocking connections. Dovecot does this whenever possible (PostgreSQL
and LDAP for example). If it's not possible, set 'blocking = TRUE'.

With both functions 'auth_request->passdb->passdb' contains the passdb_module
returned by your 'preinit()' function. 'auth_request->user' contains the
username whose password we're verifying. You don't need to worry about <master
users> [MasterUsers.txt] here. It's also possible to use any other fields in
'auth_request' to do the lookup, such as 'service', 'local_ip' or 'remote_ip'
if they exist. Often you want to let user to configure the lookup with
<variables> [Variables.txt] (eg. SQL query). In that case you can use
'auth_request_get_var_expand_table()' to retrieve the variable table for
'var_expand()'.

The passdb lookup can return one of the following results:

PASSDB_RESULT_INTERNAL_FAILURE:
  The lookup failed. For example SQL server is down.

PASSDB_RESULT_SCHEME_NOT_AVAILABLE:
  'lookup_credentials()' requested a scheme which isn't in the passdb

PASSDB_RESULT_USER_UNKNOWN:
  The user doesn't exist in the database.

PASSDB_RESULT_USER_DISABLED:
  The user is disabled either entirely, or for this specific login (eg. only
  POP3 logins allowed). This isn't commonly implemented in passdbs.

PASSDB_RESULT_PASS_EXPIRED:
  The user's password had expired. This isn't commonly implemented in passdbs.

PASSDB_RESULT_PASSWORD_MISMATCH:
  The password given in 'verify_plain()' wasn't valid.

PASSDB_RESULT_OK:
  Success.

User databases
--------------

See <UserDatabase.txt> for a description of userdbs and a list of already
implemented ones.

'struct userdb_module' is very similar to 'struct passdb_module'. The lookup
callback is a bit different though:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
typedef void userdb_callback_t(enum userdb_result result,
                               struct auth_stream_reply *reply,
                               struct auth_request *request);
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

'result' contains one of:

USERDB_RESULT_INTERNAL_FAILURE:
  The lookup failed. For example SQL server is down.

USERDB_RESULT_USER_UNKNOWN:
  The user doesn't exist in the database.

USERDB_RESULT_OK:
  Success.

There is no equivalent for PASSDB_RESULT_USER_DISABLED currently. Practically
the userdb result is used only by Dovecot's <deliver> [LDA.txt] to figure out
if the user exists or not. When logging in with IMAP or POP3, the user's
existence was already checked in passdb lookup, so only in rare conditions when
a user is logging in at the same time as it's being deleted, the userdb result
is USER_UNKNOWN.

The 'reply' parameter contains the username (it's allowed to be different from
the looked up username) and a list of key=value pairs that were found from the
userdb. The userdb should make sure that at least "uid" and "gid" keys were
returned. Here's an example code based on passwd userdb:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
reply = auth_stream_reply_init(auth_request);
auth_stream_reply_add(reply, NULL, pw->pw_name);
auth_stream_reply_add(reply, "uid", dec2str(pw->pw_uid));
auth_stream_reply_add(reply, "gid", dec2str(pw->pw_gid));
auth_stream_reply_add(reply, "home", pw->pw_dir);
callback(USERDB_RESULT_OK, reply, auth_request);
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
