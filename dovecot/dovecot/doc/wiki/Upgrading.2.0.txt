Upgrading Dovecot v1.2 to v2.0
==============================

A lot of settings have changed. Dovecot v2.0 can still use most of the v1.x
configuration files, but it logs a lot of warnings at startup. A quick and easy
way to convert your old config file to v2.0 format is:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
doveconf -n -c dovecot-1.conf > dovecot-2.conf
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This command logs a warning about each obsolete setting it converts to the new
format. You can either go through the warnings to figure out what changes
exactly were done, or you can simply trust doveconf and replace your old config
with the newly generated one.

Once running v2.0, it's safe to downgrade to v1.2.5 or newer. Older versions
don't understand some of the changes to index files and will log errors.

Permission related changes
--------------------------

 * Dovecot uses two system users for internal purposes now by default:
   "dovenull" and "dovecot". You need to create the "dovenull" user or change
   'default_login_user' setting. "dovenull" user is used by completely
   untrustworthy processes, while "dovecot" user is used for slightly more
   trusted processes.
    * If you want to be using something else than "dovecot" as the other user,
      you need to change 'default_internal_user' setting.
    * Just like with "dovecot" user, "dovenull" doesn't need a password, home
      directory or anything else (but it's good to give it its own private
      "dovenull" group).
 * "auth-master" socket related configuration should be replaced with
   "auth-userdb" socket everywhere (auth-master should still work, but it gives
   more permissions than necessary)
 * If you get any kind of "permission denied" errors related to UNIX sockets,
   you can change their permissions from 'service { unix_listener { ... } } '
   blocks. See 'example-config/conf.d/10-master.conf' for examples or 'doveconf
   -a' output for their current values.

Other major changes
-------------------

 * No more convert plugin, use <dsync> [Tools.Dsync.txt] instead
 * No more expire-tool, use <doveadm expunge> [Plugins.Expire.txt] instead.
   Also expire configuration is different.
 * <Post-login scripts are configured differently> [PostLoginScripting.txt] and
   need to be modified
 * <Quota warnings are configured differently> [Quota.Configuration.txt] and
   the script may need to be modified (most environment settings like $USER are
   gone)
 * Global ACL filenames now require namespace prefix (e.g. if you use "INBOX."
   prefix,'/etc/acls/foo' needs to be renamed to '/etc/acls/INBOX.foo'
 * Maildir: Permissions for newly created mail files are no longer copied from
   dovecot-shared file, but instead from the mail directory (e.g. for "foo"
   mailbox, they're taken from '~/Maildir/.foo' directory)
 * dbox: v2.0 format is slightly different, but backwards compatible. The main
   problem is that v2.0 no longer supports maildir-dbox hybrid resulting from
   "fast Maildir migration". If you have any Maildir files in your dbox, you
   need to convert them somehow (some examples
   [http://dovecot.org/list/dovecot/2010-September/053012.html]). You might
   also consider using <dsync> [Tools.Dsync.txt] to get rid of the old unused
   metadata in your dbox files.
 * Pre-login and post-login CAPABILITY reply is now different. Dovecot expects
   clients to recognize new automatically sent capabilities.
   [http://dovecot.org/list/dovecot/2010-April/048147.html] This should work
   with all commonly used clients, but some rarely used clients might have
   problems. Either get the client fixed, or set 'imap_capability' manually.
 * ManageSieve protocol [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5804] was assigned an
   official port by IANA: 4190. This is used by <Pigeonhole.txt> by default
   now. If you want to listen also on the old 2000 port, see the
   <Pigeonhole.ManageSieve.Configuration.txt> example.
 * 'dovecot --exec-mail imap' has been replaced by simply running "imap"
   binary. You can also use "imap -u<username>" to access other users' mails
   more easily.

LDA
---

 * deliver binary was renamed to dovecot-lda (but a symlink still exists for
   now)
 * -n parameter was replaced by lda_mailbox_autocreate setting. The default
   also changed to "no".
 * -s parameter was replaced by lda_mailbox_autosubscribe setting. The default
   is "no", as before.
