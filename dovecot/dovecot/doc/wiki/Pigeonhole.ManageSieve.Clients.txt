ManageSieve Client Issues
=========================

Although this ManageSieve server should comply with the draft specification of
theManageSieve protocol, quite a few clients don't. This page lists the known
client problems.

 * *The TLS problem*:
 * The core of the TLS problem is that a ManageSieve server is required to send
   an unsolicited CAPABILITY response right after successful TLS negotiation.
   Older Cyrus servers did not do this and many clients incorporated this
   protocol error as the standard, meaning that these do not expect the
   CAPABILITY response and thus fail with subsequent commands. However, now
   that Cyrus' Timsieved has changed its behaviour towards protocol compliance,
   all those clients will follow eventually. The following clients are known to
   have this TLS issue:

   Thunderbird Sieve add-on:
     TLS broken for old versions. Starting with version 0.1.5 the Thunderbird
     Sieve add-on properly supports TLS.

   KMail + kio_sieve:
     TLS broken for old versions. This issue is fixed at least in kmail 1.9.9 /
     kde 3.5.9.

   SquirrelMail/AvelSieve:
     For some users the !Avelsieve client stores scripts but fails to retrieve
     them later. This problem is directly caused byAvelSieve's TLS support. A
     quick way to fix this is not to enable TLS forManageSieve. AvelSieve
     stable (v1.0.1) does not have TLS support at all, so you will see this
     happen only with the development or SVN versions.  Another issue is that
     (at least with avelsieve-1.9.7) it is impossible to delete the last rule
     of a script. For avelsieve-1.9.7 you find a patch that fixes these two
     issues here
     [http://www.rename-it.nl/dovecot/client-patches/avelsieve-1.9.7-dovecot.patch].

 * *Smartsieve, Websieve*:
 * These clients are specifically written for Cyrus timsieved and fail on
   multiple stages of the protocol when connected to PigeonholeManageSieve.
    * /(Stephan Bosch)/: I intend to look at these in the future, but currently
      these are very much unavailable for use with Dovecot. But, feel free to
      fix these yourself:)
    * /(Steffen "Stefreak" Neubauer)/: I've fixed the problems for smartsieve.
      Just replace your lib/Managesieve.php with this
      here:https://www.commail.org/sieve/lib/Managesieve.phps - HAVE FUN!

*NOTE*: If you add new issues to this list, notify the author or send an e-mail
to the Dovecot mailing list [http://dovecot.org/mailinglists.html]. In any
case, you must make sure that the issue is properly explained and that the
author can contact you for more information.
