Allow_nets extra field
----------------------

This is a comma separated list of IPs and/or networks where the user is allowed
to log in from. If the user tries to log in elsewhere, the authentication will
fail the same way as if a wrong password was given.

Example: 'allow_nets=127.0.0.0/8,192.168.0.0/16,1.2.3.4,4.5.6.7'.

IPv6 addresses are also allowed. IPv6 mapped IPv4 addresses (eg.
'::ffff:1.2.3.4') are converted to standard IPv4 addresses before matching. 
Example:'allow_nets=::1,2001:abcd:abcd::0:0/80,1.2.3.4'

passwd-file example

user:{plain}password::::::allow_nets=192.168.0.0/24
