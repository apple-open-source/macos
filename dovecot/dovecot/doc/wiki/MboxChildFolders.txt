Mail folders containing both messages and sub-folders
-----------------------------------------------------

Under mbox, it is not normally possible to have a mail folder which contains
both messages and sub-folders. This is because there would be a filesystem name
collision between the name of the mbox file containing the messages and the
name of the directory containing the sub-folders, for example:

 * Mail folder "foo" containing messages would be stored in a file at
   '~/mail/foo'.
 * Mail folder "foo/bar" containing messages would be stored in a file at
   '~/mail/foo/bar', but this cannot happen because this relies on the
   existence of a directory '~/mail/foo/' which can't exist because there is
   already a file with that name.

If however there is a requirement to be able to have a mail folder which
contains both messages and sub-folders, then there are a couple of ways to do
it:

 1. Maildir++ layout
 2. Messages in named file

These approaches are described in more detail below.

Maildir++ layout
----------------

Under mbox, Dovecot normally stores mail folders in "filesystem" layout. In
this layout, mail folders are stored in mbox files (potentially under
subdirectories) with the same relative path as the mail folder path, for
example:

 * '~/mail/foo' - mbox file containing mail for mail folder "foo"; can not
   create any mail sub-folders of "foo"
 * '~/mail/bar/baz' - mbox file containing mail for mail folder "bar/baz"; can
   not create any mail sub-folders of "bar/baz"
 * ('~/mail/inbox' - mbox file containing mail for INBOX)

However, Dovecot can be configured to keep mbox mail in a Maildir++-like
layout. This makes Dovecot keep mail in mbox files where all the mailbox folder
naming levels are separated with dots (with a leading dot), for example:

 * '~/mail/.foo' - mbox file containing mail for mail folder "foo"
 * '~/mail/.foo.bar' - mbox file containing mail for mail folder "foo/bar". We
   can now do this.
 * '~/mail/.bar.baz' - mbox file containing mail for mail folder "bar/baz"
 * ('~/mail/inbox' - mbox file containing mail for INBOX)

This can be enabled by adding ':LAYOUT=maildir++' to the mail location, for
example:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Incomplete example. Do not use!
mail_location = mbox:~/mail:LAYOUT=maildir++
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

However there is a problem. Under mbox, setting 'LAYOUT=maildir++' alone leaves
Dovecot unable to place index files, which would likely result in performance
issues. So when using 'LAYOUT=maildir++' with mbox, it is advisable to also
configure 'INDEX'. Now, mail files (other than 'inbox') all have names
beginning with a dot, so if we like we can store other things in the '~/mail'
directory by using names which do not begin with a dot. So we could think to
use 'INDEX' to indexes at '~/mail/index/', for example:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Incomplete example. Do not use!
mail_location = mbox:~/mail:LAYOUT=maildir++:INDEX=~/mail/index
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we do this, then indexes will be kept at '~/mail/index/' and this will not
clash with any names used for mail folders. There is one more thing we may want
to consider though. By default Dovecot will maintain a list of subscribed
folders in a file '.subscriptions' under the mail location root. In this case
that means it would end up at '~/mail/.subscriptions'. This would then mean
that it would be impossible to create a mail folder called "subscriptions". We
can get around this by using the 'CONTROL' parameter to move the
'.subscriptions' file somewhere else, for example into the directory
'~/mail/control' (again choosing a name which doesn't begin with a dot so we
don't collide with the names of mbox files storing mail folders). That gives
us:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Trick mbox configuration which allows a mail folder which contains both
# messages and sub-folders
mail_location =
mbox:~/mail:LAYOUT=maildir++:INDEX=~/mail/index:CONTROL=~/mail/control
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This then allows mail folders which contains both messages and sub-folders
without possibility of naming collisions between mail folders and other data.

There is one further wrinkle. Specifying ':LAYOUT=maildir++' for mbox changes
the default hierarchy separator from a slash to a dot. This should not be a
problem for IMAP clients as the hierarchy separator is exposed through IMAP.
However anything which expects to just "know" that the hierarchy separator is a
slash may get confused. This can be worked around by using a <namespace>
[Namespaces.txt] to set the folder separator back to a slash again.

Messages in named file
----------------------

Under mbox, Dovecot normally stores mail folders in "filesystem" layout. In
this layout, mail folders are stored in mbox files (potentially under
subdirectories) with the same relative path as the mail folder path, for
example:

 * '~/mail/foo' - mbox file containing mail for mail folder "foo"; can not
   create any mail sub-folders of "foo"
 * '~/mail/bar/baz' - mbox file containing mail for mail folder "bar/baz"; can
   not create any mail sub-folders of "bar/baz"
 * ('~/mail/inbox' - mbox file containing mail for INBOX)

In the example above, we can't create any sub-folders of "foo" because there is
a file 'foo' in the way. So we could think to get rid of that file and put a
directory there instead. But if we do that then we need somewhere to put the
messages for folder "foo". We could think to put them in a specially-named file
in the directory 'foo/'. Then if we wanted to create a sub-folder of "foo" we
would be fine because we could then do that. The rule would then be that
messages go into the specially-named file in the directory corresponding to the
mail folder name. We want want to choose a special name which would be unlikely
to collide with a folder name. We could think to use something like
'mBoX-MeSsAgEs'. Now, it turns out that you can configure Dovecot to do this
using the 'DIRNAME' parameter. For example, using a configuration of:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Incomplete example. Do not use!
mail_location = mbox:~/mail:DIRNAME=mBoX-MeSsAgEs
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

we would get a layout like this:

 * '~/mail/inbox' - mbox file containing mail for INBOX
 * '~/mail/foo/mBoX-MeSsAgEs' - mbox file containing mail for mail folder "foo"

 * '~/mail/foo/bar/mBoX-MeSsAgEs' - mbox file containing mail for mail folder
   "foo/bar"

However there is a problem. Under mbox, setting 'DIRNAME' alone leaves Dovecot
unable to place index files, which would likely result in performance issues,
or worse, if the index directory gets created first, this will obstruct the
creation of the mbox file. So when using 'DIRNAME' with mbox, it is also
necessary to configure 'INDEX'. The question then arises where to put index
files.

Any directory under the '~/mail' directory could be considered as a mail
folder. We could think to use a name beginning with a dot, for example
'~/mail/.index' but that would then mean that it would not be possible to
create a mail folder called ".index"; unlikely, but it would be nice to have as
few implementation-specific restrictions as possible.

In addition, by default, Dovecot will create a file '.subscriptions' at the
mail location root to hold a list of mailbox subscriptions. This would make it
impossible to create a mail folder called ".subscriptions". But we can move the
'.subscriptions' file to another directory by using the 'CONTROL' parameter. To
get round these issues, we can add another directory layer which separates
these purposes. For example, using the configuration:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Trick mbox configuration which allows a mail folder which contains both
# messages and sub-folders
mail_location =
mbox:~/mail/mailboxes:DIRNAME=mBoX-MeSsAgEs:INDEX=~/mail/index:CONTROL=~/mail/control
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

would result in the following layout:

 * '~/mail/mailboxes/foo/mBoX-MeSsAgEs' - mbox file containing messages for
   mail folder "foo"
 * '~/mail/mailboxes/foo/bar/mBoX-MeSsAgEs' - mbox file containing messages for
   mail folder "foo/bar"
 * '~/mail/mailboxes/inbox' - mbox file containing messages for INBOX
 * '~/mail/control/.subscriptions' - file containg list of subscribed mailboxes

 * '~/mail/index/INBOX/dovecot.index.*' - index files for INBOX
 * '~/mail/index/foo/dovecot.index.*' - index files for mail folder "foo"
 * '~/mail/index/foo/bar/dovecot.index.*' - index files for mail folder
   "foo/bar"
 * '~/mail/index/dovecot.mailbox.log' - other index files

Restrictions on mail folder names are then minimised; we can't have mail
folders with the names "mBoX-M ''eSsAgEs", "dovecot.index.*, or
"dovecot.mailbox.log".

Unlike the Maildir++ layout approach above, because we are still using
"filesystem" layout, the hierarchy separator remains as a slash.
