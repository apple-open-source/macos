Client issues and configuration
===============================

It seems to be quite difficult to implement a working IMAP client. Best
Practices for Implementing an IMAP Client

Apple Mail.app
--------------

On Mac OS X Leopard 10.5 Mail.app appears to support subscribe/unsubscribe by
right clicking on a mailbox, selecting 'Get Account Info' and selecting
'Subscription List' from tabs. This however doesn't really work with any IMAP
server.

Apple Mail 3.6 (that comes with OS X 10.5 Leopard) supports
subscribing/unsubscribing to folders in the public namespace.

Outlook
-------

 * You should enable 'outlook-no-nuls' workaround with POP3.
 * Outlook 2003 has problems with older Dovecot's default POP3 UIDL format,
   which causes it to download the same mails over and over again if "leave
   mails to server" option is enabled. See 'pop3_uidl_format' setting.
 * Outlook might not hide or purge deleted items by default. Microsoft has a
   how-to that shows how to fix this
   [http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/HP100804201033.aspx] (Outlook
   2007, not Outlook 2003).
 * If some Outlook users don't see new or sent mails in the appropriate folders
   after a migration from UW IMAPd even if they are visible in other clients
   (e.g. Roundcube, Thunderbird, or on the disk itself), and you get the error
   message "BAD Error in IMAP command UID: Invalid UID messageset" in the log
   or rawlog: It helps to remove the problematic IMAP account completely from
   Outlook and recreating it again there. It speaks a different IMAP
   afterwards, so there are reasons to believe it caches the details of some
   server on the first connect and doesn't refresh them even if you change the
   server's hostname in the account settings.

Outlook Express 6
-----------------

 * Using "Headers only" synchronization is buggy and can cause "Message is no
   longer available on this server" error when opening a mail. This isn't
   Dovecot specific problem, and I'm not aware of any possible workarounds at
   the moment for this in server side.
 * You should enable 'delay-newmail' workarounds for IMAP.
 * You should enable 'outlook-no-nuls' and 'oe-ns-eoh' workarounds for POP3.

Netscape Mail
-------------

I'm not actually sure what version exactly this refers to.

 * You should enable 'oe-ns-eoh' workaround for POP3.

Evolution
---------

 * Some versions don't support creating subfolders with mbox format. Evolution
   in Ubuntu Gutsy, 2.12.0-0ubuntu5, does support creating subfolders, at least
   when the parent folder is empty.

Mulberry
--------

Seems to be OK.

Thunderbird
-----------

 * If you're using <mbox> [MailboxFormat.mbox.txt], <dbox>
   [MailboxFormat.dbox.txt] or <Maildir> [MailLocation.Maildir.txt] with
   ':LAYOUT=fs' ,
    * You should enable 'tb-extra-mailbox-sep' workaround for IMAP. Bug report
      [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29926].
 * If you're using <mbox> [MailboxFormat.mbox.txt]:
    * You'll have to disable "Server supports folders that contain sub-folders
      and messages" setting from Thunderbird.Enhancement request
      [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=284933].

Mutt
----

 * New mutt versions supporting IDLE command will hang with Dovecot versions
   earlier than v1.0beta3. Upgrade Dovecot or disable IDLE by setting
   imap_idle=no in .muttrc.
 * <Using mutt with IMAP> [mutt.txt]

Pine
----

Seems to be OK.

SquirrelMail
------------

 * Configuration asks IMAP server name for some workarounds. There has been a
   Dovecot option since 1.4.6 and 1.5.1. For olderSquirrelMail versions, select
   the "other" option and remove the default INBOX-prefix.

Horde IMP
---------

Dovecot namespace detection works automatically with any recent version of IMP
(4.1+).

Quota support is now integrated into the 'imap' driver (as of horde-groupware
V1.2), an example config of /imp/config/servers.php is:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
$servers['imap'] = array(
    'name' => 'IMAP Server',
    'server' => 'localhost',
    'hordeauth' => false,
    'protocol' => 'imap/notls',
    'port' => 143,
    'quota' => array('driver'=>'imap'),
);
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

RoundCube Webmail
-----------------

Works fine.

@Mail Webmail
-------------

Uses the namespace returned via Dovecot, full support via IMAP/POP3 using @Mail
[http://atmail.com/]. Can also read mailbox quota via the getquotaroot IMAP
command.
