Chrooting
=========

Traditionally chrooting has been done to run the whole server within a single
chroot. This is also possible with Dovecot, but it requires manually setting up
the chroot and it can be a bit tricky. Dovecot however supports internally
running different parts of it in different chroots:

 * Login processes (imap-login, pop3-login) are chrooted by default into an
   empty non-writable directory.
 * Authentication process (dovecot-auth) can be chrooted by setting
   'chroot=<path>' inside 'service auth' and/or 'service auth-worker' sections.
   This could be a good idea to change if you're not using a passdb or userdb
   that needs to access files outside of the chroot. Also make sure not to run
   the auth process as root then.
 * Mail processes (imap, pop3) can be made to chroot in different ways. See
   below.

Security problems
-----------------

If chrooting is used incorrectly, it allows local users to gain root
privileges. This is possible by hardlinking setuid binaries inside the chroot
jail and tricking them. There are at least two possibilities:

 1. Hardlink '/bin/su' inside the chroot and create your own
    '<chroot>/etc/passwd'. Then simply run 'su root'.
 2. Create your own '<chroot>/lib/libc.so' and run any setuid binary.

Of course both of these require that the setuid binary can be run inside the
chroot. This isn't possible by default. Either user would have to find a
security hole from Dovecot, or the administrator would have had to set up
something special that allows running binaries.

In any case it's a good idea not to allow users to hardlink setuid binaries
inside the chroots. The safest way to do this is to mount the filesystem with
"nosuid" option.

Mail process chrooting
----------------------

Due to the potential security problem described above, Dovecot won't chroot
mail processes to directories which aren't listed in 'valid_chroot_dirs'
setting. For example if your users may be chrooting under '/var/mail/<user>/'
and '/home/<user>/', use:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
valid_chroot_dirs = /var/mail:/home
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can chroot all users globally into the same directory by using
'mail_chroot' setting. For example:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
mail_chroot = /home
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also make userdb return a chroot. There are two ways to do that:

 1. Make userdb return 'chroot=<path>' field.
 2. Insert "/./" inside the returned home directory, eg.: 'home=/home/./user'
    to chroot into '/home', or 'home=/home/user/./' to chroot into
    '/home/user'.
