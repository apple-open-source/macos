        # this test works like this:
        # - use curl to POST data to the server /h2test/echo
        # - feed curl the data in chunks, wait a bit between chunks
        # - since some buffering on curl's stdout to Python is involved,
        #   we will see the response data only at the end.
        # - therefore, we enable tracing with timestamps in curl on stderr
        #   and see when the response chunks arrive
        # - if the server sends the incoming data chunks back right away,
        #   as it should, we see receiving timestamps separated roughly by the
        #   wait time between sends.
