/*
 * Apache example_hooks module.  Provide demonstrations of how modules do things.
 * It is not meant to be used in a production server.  Since it participates
 * in all of the processing phases, it could conceivable interfere with
 * the proper operation of other modules -- particularly the ones related
 * to security.
 *
 * In the interest of brevity, all functions and structures internal to
 * this module, but which may have counterparts in *real* modules, are
 * prefixed with 'x_' instead of 'example_'.
 *
 * To use mod_example_hooks, configure the Apache build with
 * --enable-example-hooks and compile.  Set up a <Location> block in your
 * configuration file like so:
 *
 * <Location /example>
 *    SetHandler example-hooks-handler
 * </Location>
 *
 * When you look at that location on your server, you will see a backtrace of
 * the callbacks that have been invoked up to that point.  See the ErrorLog for
 * more information on code paths that  touch mod_example_hooks.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTES
 * ===============
 *
 * Do NOT use this module on a production server. It attaches itself to every
 * phase of the server runtime operations including startup, shutdown and
 * request processing, and produces copious amounts of logging data.  This will
 * negatively affect server performance.
 *
 * Do NOT use mod_example_hooks as the basis for your own code.  This module
 * implements every callback hook offered by the Apache core, and your
 * module will almost certainly not have to implement this much.  If you
 * want a simple module skeleton to start development, use apxs -g.
 *
 * XXX TO DO XXX
 * =============
 *
 * * Enable HTML backtrace entries for more callbacks that are not directly
 *   associated with a request
 * * Make sure every callback that posts an HTML backtrace entry does so in the *   right category, so nothing gets overwritten
 * * Implement some logic to show what happens in the parent, and what in the
 *   child(ren)
