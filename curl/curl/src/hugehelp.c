"       supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS,  SCP,  SFTP,  TFTP,  DICT,\n"
"       TELNET,  LDAP  or  FILE).  The command is designed to work without user\n"
"       interaction.\n"
"\n"
"       curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authen‐\n"

"       The URL syntax is protocol dependent. You’ll find a  detailed  descrip‐\n"

"\n"
"       You  can  specify  multiple  URLs or parts of URLs by writing part sets\n"
"       within braces as in:\n"
"\n"
"        http://site.{one,two,three}.com\n"
"\n"
"       or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:\n"
