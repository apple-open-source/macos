.SH NAME
curl_mime_type \- set a mime part\(aqs content type
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_mime_type(curl_mimepart *part, const char *mimetype);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcurl_mime_type(3)\fP sets a mime part\(aqs content type.

\fIpart\fP is the part\(aqs handle to assign the content type to.

\fImimetype\fP points to the null\-terminated file mime type string; it may be
set to NULL to remove a previously attached mime type.

The mime type string is copied into the part, thus the associated storage may
safely be released or reused after call. Setting a part\(aqs type multiple times
is valid: only the value set by the last call is retained.

In the absence of a mime type and if needed by the protocol specifications,
a default mime type is determined by the context:

- If set as a custom header, use this value.

- application/form\-data for an HTTP form post.

- If a remote filename is set, the mime type is taken from the file name
extension, or application/octet\-stream by default.

- For a multipart part, multipart/mixed.

- text/plain in other cases.
