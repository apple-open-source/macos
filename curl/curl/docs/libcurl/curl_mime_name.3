.SH NAME
curl_mime_name \- set a mime part\(aqs name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_mime_name(curl_mimepart *part, const char *name);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcurl_mime_name(3)\fP sets a mime part\(aqs name. This is the way HTTP form
fields are named.

\fIpart\fP is the part\(aqs handle to assign a name to.

\fIname\fP points to the null\-terminated name string.

The name string is copied into the part, thus the associated storage may
safely be released or reused after call. Setting a part\(aqs name multiple times
is valid: only the value set by the last call is retained. It is possible to
reset the name of a part by setting \fIname\fP to NULL.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
int main(void)
{
  curl_mime *mime;
  curl_mimepart *part;

  CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
  if(curl) {
    /* create a mime handle */
    mime = curl_mime_init(curl);

    /* add a part */
    part = curl_mime_addpart(mime);

    /* give the part a name */
    curl_mime_name(part, "shoe_size");
  }
}
.fi
