.SH NAME
curl_free \- reclaim memory that has been obtained through a libcurl call
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

void curl_free(void *ptr);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
curl_free reclaims memory that has been obtained through a libcurl call. Use
\fIcurl_free(3)\fP instead of free() to avoid anomalies that can result from
differences in memory management between your application and libcurl.

Passing in a NULL pointer in \fIptr\fP makes this function return immediately
with no action.

.nf
int main(void)
{
  char *width = curl_getenv("COLUMNS");
  if(width) {
    /* it was set! */
    curl_free(width);
  }
}
