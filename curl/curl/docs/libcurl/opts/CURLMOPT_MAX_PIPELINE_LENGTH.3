.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
No function since pipelining was removed in 7.62.0.

Pass a long. The set \fBmax\fP number is used as the maximum amount of
outstanding requests in an HTTP/1.1 pipeline. This option is only used for
HTTP/1.1 pipelining, not for HTTP/2 multiplexing.

When this limit is reached, libcurl creates another connection to the same
host (see \fICURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS(3)\fP), or queue the request until one
.nf
of the pipelines to the host is ready to accept a request. Thus, the total
.fi
\fICURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH(3)\fP.
