.SH NAME
CURLOPT_USERNAME \- user name to use in authentication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_USERNAME,
                          char *username);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a char pointer as parameter, which should be pointing to the
null\-terminated user name to use for the transfer.

\fICURLOPT_USERNAME(3)\fP sets the user name to be used in protocol
authentication. You should not use this option together with the (older)
\fICURLOPT_USERPWD(3)\fP option.

When using Kerberos V5 authentication with a Windows based server, you should
include the domain name in order for the server to successfully obtain a
Kerberos Ticket. If you do not then the initial part of the authentication
handshake may fail.

When using NTLM, the user name can be specified simply as the user name
without the domain name should the server be part of a single domain and
forest.

To include the domain name use either Down\-Level Logon Name or UPN (User
Principal Name) formats. For example, \fBEXAMPLE\user\fP and
\fBuser@example.com\fP respectively.

Some HTTP servers (on Windows) support inclusion of the domain for Basic
authentication as well.

To specify the password and login options, along with the user name, use the
\fICURLOPT_PASSWORD(3)\fP and \fICURLOPT_LOGIN_OPTIONS(3)\fP options.

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.
