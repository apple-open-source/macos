.SH NAME
CURLOPT_HTTP09_ALLOWED \- allow HTTP/0.9 response

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_HTTP09_ALLOWED, long allowed);

.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass the long argument \fIallowed\fP set to 1L to allow HTTP/0.9 responses.

An HTTP/0.9 response is a server response entirely without headers and only a
body. You can connect to lots of random TCP services and still get a response
that curl might consider to be HTTP/0.9!
.SH DEFAULT
curl allowed HTTP/0.9 responses by default before 7.66.0

Since 7.66.0, libcurl requires this option set to 1L to allow HTTP/0.9
responses.
.SH PROTOCOLS
HTTP

    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_HTTP09_ALLOWED, 1L);
    ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
  }
}
.fi
