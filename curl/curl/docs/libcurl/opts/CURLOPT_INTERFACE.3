.SH NAME
CURLOPT_INTERFACE \- source interface for outgoing traffic
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_INTERFACE, char *interface);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a char pointer as parameter. This sets the \fIinterface\fP name to use as
outgoing network interface. The name can be an interface name, an IP address,
or a hostname.

If the parameter starts with "if!" then it is treated only as an interface
name. If the parameter starts with &"host!" it is treated as either an IP
address or a hostname.

If "if!" is specified but the parameter does not match an existing interface,
\fICURLE_INTERFACE_FAILED\fP is returned from the libcurl function used to
perform the transfer.

libcurl does not support using network interface names for this option on
Windows.

We strongly advise against specifying the interface with a hostname, as it
causes libcurl to do a blocking name resolve call to retrieve the IP
address. That name resolve operation does \fBnot\fP use DNS\-over\-HTTPS even if
\fICURLOPT_DOH_URL(3)\fP is set.

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.
.SH DEFAULT
NULL, use whatever the TCP stack finds suitable
.SH PROTOCOLS
All
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
int main(void)
{
  CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
  if(curl) {
    CURLcode res;
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/foo.bin");

    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_INTERFACE, "eth0");

    res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

    curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
  }
}
.fi
