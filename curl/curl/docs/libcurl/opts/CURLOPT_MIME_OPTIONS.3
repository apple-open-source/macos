.SH NAME
CURLOPT_MIME_OPTIONS \- set MIME option flags
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_MIME_OPTIONS, long options);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long that holds a bitmask of CURLMIMEOPT_* defines. Each bit is a
Boolean flag used while encoding a MIME tree or multipart form data.

Available bits are:
.IP CURLMIMEOPT_FORMESCAPE
Tells libcurl to escape multipart form field and file names using the
backslash\-escaping algorithm rather than percent\-encoding (HTTP only).

Backslash\-escaping consists in preceding backslashes and double quotes with
a backslash. Percent encoding maps all occurrences of double quote,
carriage return and line feed to %22, %0D and %0A respectively.

Before version 7.81.0, percent\-encoding was never applied.

HTTP browsers used to do backslash\-escaping in the past but have over time
transitioned to use percent\-encoding. This option allows one to address
server\-side applications that have not yet have been converted.

As an example, consider field or filename \fIstrangename"kind\fP. When the
containing multipart form is sent, this is normally transmitted as
\fIstrangename%22kind\fP. When this option is set, it is sent as
\fIstrangename"kind\fP.
.SH DEFAULT
0, meaning disabled.
.SH PROTOCOLS
HTTP, IMAP, SMTP
