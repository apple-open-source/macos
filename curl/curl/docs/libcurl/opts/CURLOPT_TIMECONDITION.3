.SH NAME
CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION \- select condition for a time request
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION, long cond);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long as parameter. This defines how the \fICURLOPT_TIMEVALUE(3)\fP time
value is treated. You can set this parameter to \fICURL_TIMECOND_IFMODSINCE\fP
or \fICURL_TIMECOND_IFUNMODSINCE\fP.

The last modification time of a file is not always known and in such instances
this feature has no effect even if the given time condition would not have
been met. \fIcurl_easy_getinfo(3)\fP with the \fICURLINFO_CONDITION_UNMET\fP
option can be used after a transfer to learn if a zero\-byte successful
\&"transfer" was due to this condition not matching.
.SH DEFAULT
CURL_TIMECOND_NONE (0)
.SH PROTOCOLS
HTTP, FTP, RTSP, and FILE
