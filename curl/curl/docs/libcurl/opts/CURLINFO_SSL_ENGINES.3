.SH NAME
CURLINFO_SSL_ENGINES \- get an slist of OpenSSL crypto\-engines
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_SSL_ENGINES,
                           struct curl_slist **engine_list);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass the address of a \(aqstruct curl_slist *\(aq to receive a linked\-list of
OpenSSL crypto\-engines supported. Note that engines are normally implemented
in separate dynamic libraries. Hence not all the returned engines may be
available at runtime. \fBNOTE:\fP you must call \fIcurl_slist_free_all(3)\fP
on the list pointer once you are done with it, as libcurl does not free this
data for you.
.SH PROTOCOLS
All TLS based ones.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
int main(void)
{
  CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
  if(curl) {
    CURLcode res;
    struct curl_slist *engines;
    res = curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_SSL_ENGINES, &engines);
    if((res == CURLE_OK) && engines) {
      /* we have a list, free it when done using it */
      curl_slist_free_all(engines);
    }

    curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
  }
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.12.3. Available in OpenSSL builds with "engine" support.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
