.SH NAME
CURLMOPT_PIPELINING \- enable HTTP pipelining and multiplexing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_PIPELINING, long bitmask);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass in the correct value in the \fBbitmask\fP parameter to instruct libcurl
to enable multiplexing for this multi handle.

With multiplexing enabled, libcurl attempts to do multiple transfers over the
same connection when doing parallel transfers to the same hosts.
.IP "CURLPIPE_NOTHING (0)"
Default, which means doing no attempts at multiplexing.
.IP "CURLPIPE_HTTP1 (1)"
This bit is deprecated and has no effect since version 7.62.0.
.IP "CURLPIPE_MULTIPLEX (2)"
If this bit is set, libcurl tries to multiplex the new transfer over an
existing connection if possible. This requires HTTP/2 or HTTP/3.
.SH DEFAULT
Since 7.62.0, \fBCURLPIPE_MULTIPLEX\fP is enabled by default.

Before that, default was \fBCURLPIPE_NOTHING\fP.
.SH PROTOCOLS
HTTP(S)
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
int main(void)
{
  CURLM *m = curl_multi_init();
  /* try HTTP/2 multiplexing */
  curl_multi_setopt(m, CURLMOPT_PIPELINING, CURLPIPE_MULTIPLEX);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.16.0. Multiplex support bit added in 7.43.0. HTTP/1 Pipelining
support was disabled in 7.62.0.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLM_OK if the option is supported, and CURLM_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
