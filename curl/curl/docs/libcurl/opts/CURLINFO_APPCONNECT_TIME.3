.SH NAME
CURLINFO_APPCONNECT_TIME \- get the time until the SSL/SSH handshake is completed
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_APPCONNECT_TIME,
                           double *timep);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the time, in seconds, it took from the
start until the SSL/SSH connect/handshake to the remote host was completed.
This time is most often close to the \fICURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME(3)\fP time,
except for cases such as HTTP pipelining where the pretransfer time can be
delayed due to waits in line for the pipeline and more.

When a redirect is followed, the time from each request is added together.

See also the TIMES overview in the \fIcurl_easy_getinfo(3)\fP man page.
