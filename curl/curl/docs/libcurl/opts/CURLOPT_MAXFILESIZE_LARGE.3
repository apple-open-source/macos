.SH NAME
CURLOPT_MAXFILESIZE_LARGE \- maximum file size allowed to download
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_MAXFILESIZE_LARGE,
                          curl_off_t size);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a curl_off_t as parameter. This specifies the maximum accepted \fIsize\fP
(in bytes) of a file to download. If the file requested is found larger than
this value, the transfer is aborted and \fICURLE_FILESIZE_EXCEEDED\fP is
returned.

The file size is not always known prior to the download start, and for such
transfers this option has no effect \- even if the file transfer eventually
ends up being larger than this given limit.

Since 8.4.0, this option also stops ongoing transfers if they reach this
threshold.
.SH DEFAULT
None
.SH PROTOCOLS
FTP, HTTP and MQTT

    /* refuse to download if larger than ridiculous */
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_MAXFILESIZE_LARGE, ridiculous);
    ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
