.SH NAME
CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR \- filename to store cookies to
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR, char *filename);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a \fIfilename\fP as a char *, null\-terminated. This makes libcurl write
all internally known cookies to the specified file when
\fIcurl_easy_cleanup(3)\fP is called. If no cookies are kept in memory at that
time, no file is created. Specify "\-" as filename to instead have the cookies
written to stdout. Using this option also enables cookies for this session, so
if you for example follow a redirect it makes matching cookies get sent
accordingly.

Note that libcurl does not read any cookies from the cookie jar specified with
this option. To read cookies from a file, use \fICURLOPT_COOKIEFILE(3)\fP.

If the cookie jar file cannot be created or written to (when the
\fIcurl_easy_cleanup(3)\fP is called), libcurl does not and cannot report an
error for this. Using \fICURLOPT_VERBOSE(3)\fP or
\fICURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION(3)\fP displays a warning, but that is the only
visible feedback you get about this possibly lethal situation.

Cookies are imported in the Set\-Cookie format without a domain name are not
exported by this option.

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.
