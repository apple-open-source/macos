.SH NAME
curl_share_init \- Create a shared object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLSH *curl_share_init();
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function returns a pointer to a \fICURLSH\fP handle to be used as input
to all the other share\-functions, sometimes referred to as a share handle in
some places in the documentation. This init call MUST have a corresponding
call to \fIcurl_share_cleanup(3)\fP when all operations using the share are
complete.

This \fIshare handle\fP is what you pass to curl using the
\fICURLOPT_SHARE(3)\fP option with \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP, to make that
specific curl handle use the data in this share.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
int main(void)
{
  CURLSHcode sh;
  CURLSH *share = curl_share_init();
  sh = curl_share_setopt(share, CURLSHOPT_SHARE, CURL_LOCK_DATA_CONNECT);
  if(sh)
    printf("Error: %s\\n", curl_share_strerror(sh));
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.10
.SH RETURN VALUE
If this function returns NULL, something went wrong (out of memory, etc.)
and therefore the share object was not created.
