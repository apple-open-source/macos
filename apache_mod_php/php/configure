# If the C compiler in not in ANSI C mode by default, try to add an option
# to output variable @code{CC} to make it so.  This macro tries various
# options that select ANSI C on some system or another.  It considers the
# compiler to be in ANSI C mode if it handles function prototypes correctly.
#
# If you use this macro, you should check after calling it whether the C
# compiler has been set to accept ANSI C; if not, the shell variable
# @code{am_cv_prog_cc_stdc} is set to @samp{no}.  If you wrote your source
# code in ANSI C, you can make an un-ANSIfied copy of it by using the
# program @code{ansi2knr}, which comes with Ghostscript.

| You chose to compile PHP with the built-in MySQL support.  If you  |
| are compiling a server module, and intend to use other server      |
| modules that also use MySQL (e.g, mod_auth_mysql, PHP 3.0,         |
| mod_perl) you must NOT rely on PHP's built-in MySQL support, and   |
| instead build it with your local MySQL support files, by adding    |
| --with-mysql=/path/to/mysql to your configure line.                |
