# If the C compiler in not in ANSI C mode by default, try to add an option
# to output variable @code{CC} to make it so.  This macro tries various
# options that select ANSI C on some system or another.  It considers the
# compiler to be in ANSI C mode if it handles function prototypes correctly.
#
# If you use this macro, you should check after calling it whether the C
# compiler has been set to accept ANSI C; if not, the shell variable
# @code{am_cv_prog_cc_stdc} is set to @samp{no}.  If you wrote your source
# code in ANSI C, you can make an un-ANSIfied copy of it by using the
# program @code{ansi2knr}, which comes with Ghostscript.

# serial 40 AC_PROG_LIBTOOL




# AC_LIBTOOL_DLOPEN - enable checks for dlopen support


# AC_LIBTOOL_WIN32_DLL - declare package support for building win32 dll's


# AC_ENABLE_SHARED - implement the --enable-shared flag
# Usage: AC_ENABLE_SHARED[(DEFAULT)]
#   Where DEFAULT is either `yes' or `no'.  If omitted, it defaults to
#   `yes'.


# AC_DISABLE_SHARED - set the default shared flag to --disable-shared


# AC_ENABLE_STATIC - implement the --enable-static flag
# Usage: AC_ENABLE_STATIC[(DEFAULT)]
#   Where DEFAULT is either `yes' or `no'.  If omitted, it defaults to
#   `yes'.


# AC_DISABLE_STATIC - set the default static flag to --disable-static



# AC_ENABLE_FAST_INSTALL - implement the --enable-fast-install flag
# Usage: AC_ENABLE_FAST_INSTALL[(DEFAULT)]
#   Where DEFAULT is either `yes' or `no'.  If omitted, it defaults to
#   `yes'.


# AC_ENABLE_FAST_INSTALL - set the default to --disable-fast-install


# AC_PROG_LD - find the path to the GNU or non-GNU linker




# AC_PROG_NM - find the path to a BSD-compatible name lister


# AC_CHECK_LIBM - check for math library


# AC_LIBLTDL_CONVENIENCE[(dir)] - sets LIBLTDL to the link flags for
# the libltdl convenience library and INCLTDL to the include flags for
# the libltdl header and adds --enable-ltdl-convenience to the
# configure arguments.  Note that LIBLTDL and INCLTDL are not
# AC_SUBSTed, nor is AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS called.  If DIR is not
# provided, it is assumed to be `libltdl'.  LIBLTDL will be prefixed
# with '${top_builddir}/' and INCLTDL will be prefixed with
# '${top_srcdir}/' (note the single quotes!).  If your package is not
# flat and you're not using automake, define top_builddir and
# top_srcdir appropriately in the Makefiles.


# AC_LIBLTDL_INSTALLABLE[(dir)] - sets LIBLTDL to the link flags for
# the libltdl installable library and INCLTDL to the include flags for
# the libltdl header and adds --enable-ltdl-install to the configure
# arguments.  Note that LIBLTDL and INCLTDL are not AC_SUBSTed, nor is
# AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS called.  If DIR is not provided and an installed
# libltdl is not found, it is assumed to be `libltdl'.  LIBLTDL will
# be prefixed with '${top_builddir}/' and INCLTDL will be prefixed
# with '${top_srcdir}/' (note the single quotes!).  If your package is
# not flat and you're not using automake, define top_builddir and
# top_srcdir appropriately in the Makefiles.
# In the future, this macro may have to be called after AC_PROG_LIBTOOL.
