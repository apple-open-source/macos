1 Introduction
**************

GNU Libidn is an implementation of the Stringprep, Punycode and IDNA
specifications defined by the IETF Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)
working group, used for internationalized domain names.  The C library
is available under the GNU Lesser General Public License (*note GNU
LGPL::).

   The library contains a generic Stringprep implementation that does
Unicode 3.2 NFKC normalization, mapping and prohibitation of
characters, and bidirectional character handling.  Profiles for
Nameprep, iSCSI, SASL and XMPP are included.  Punycode and ASCII
Compatible Encoding (ACE) via IDNA are supported.  A mechanism to
define Top-Level Domain (TLD) specific validation tables, and to
compare strings against those tables, is included.  Default tables for
some TLDs are also included.

   The Stringprep API consists of two main functions, one for converting
data from the system's native representation into UTF-8, and one
function to perform the Stringprep processing.  Adding a new Stringprep
profile for your application within the API is straightforward.  The
Punycode API consists of one encoding function and one decoding
function.  The IDNA API consists of the ToASCII and ToUnicode
functions, as well as an high-level interface for converting entire
domain names to and from the ACE encoded form.  The TLD API consists of
one set of functions to extract the TLD name from a domain string, one
set of functions to locate the proper TLD table to use based on the TLD
name, and core functions to validate a string against a TLD table, and
some utility wrappers to perform all the steps in one call.

   The library is used by, e.g., GNU SASL and Shishi to process user
names and passwords.  Libidn can be built into GNU Libc to enable a new
system-wide getaddrinfo flag for IDN processing.

   Libidn is developed for the GNU/Linux system, but runs on over 20
Unix platforms (including Solaris, IRIX, AIX, and Tru64) and Windows.
Libidn is written in C and (parts of) the API is accessible from C,
C++, Emacs Lisp, Python and Java.  A native Java and C# port is also
provided, licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (*note
GNU LGPL::).

1.1 Getting Started
===================

This manual documents the library programming interface.  All functions
and data types provided by the library are explained.  Included are
also examples, and documentation for the command line tool `idn' that
provide a quick interface to the library.  The Emacs Lisp bindings for
the library is also discussed.

   The reader is assumed to possess basic familiarity with
internationalization concepts and network programming in C or C++.

   This manual can be used in several ways.  If read from the beginning
to the end, it gives a good introduction into the library and how it
can be used in an application.  Forward references are included where
necessary.  Later on, the manual can be used as a reference manual to
get just the information needed about any particular interface of the
library.  Experienced programmers might want to start looking at the
examples at the end of the manual (*note Examples::), and then only
read up those parts of the interface which are unclear.


File: libidn.info,  Node: Features,  Next: Library Overview,  Prev: Getting Started,  Up: Introduction

1.2 Features
============

This library might have a couple of advantages over other libraries
doing a similar job.

It's Free Software
     Anybody can use, modify, and redistribute it under the terms of the
     GNU Lesser General Public License (*note GNU LGPL::).

It's thread-safe
     No global state is kept in the library.  All functions are
     reentrant.

It's portable
     The code is intended to be written in pure ANSI C89.  It has been
     tested on many Unix like operating systems, and Windows.

It's modularized
     The library is composed of several modules, and the only
     interaction between modules is through each modules' public API.
     If you only need one piece of functionality, it is possible to
     take the files you need and incorporate them into your own project.

It's not bloated
     The design of the library is based on the smallest API necessary to
     implement the basic functionality.  It has been carefully extended
     with a small number of high-level wrappers to make it comfortable
     to use the library.  However, it does not implement additional
     functionality just for the sake of completeness.

It's documented
     Sadly, not all software comes with documentation these days.  This
     one does.

1.3 Library Overview
====================

The following illustration show the components that make up Libidn, and
how your application relates to the library.  In the illustration,
various components are shown as boxes.  You see the generic StringPrep
component, the various StringPrep profiles including Nameprep, the
Punycode component, the IDNA component, and the TLD component.  The
arrows indicate aggregation, e.g., IDNA uses Punycode and Nameprep, and
in turn Nameprep uses the generic StringPrep interface.  The interfaces
to all components are available for applications, no component within
the library is hidden from the application.

File: libidn.info,  Node: Downloading and Installing,  Next: Bug Reports,  Prev: Commercial Support,  Up: Introduction

1.7 Downloading and Installing
==============================

The package can be downloaded from several places, including:

   `http://josefsson.org/libidn/releases/'

   The latest version is stored in a file, e.g., `gsasl-0.6.14.tar.gz'
where the `0.6.14' value is the highest version number in the directory.

   The package is then extracted, configured and built like many other
packages that use Autoconf.  For detailed information on configuring
and building it, refer to the `INSTALL' file that is part of the
distribution archive.

   Here is an example terminal session that download, configure, build
and install the package.  You will need a few basic tools, such as
`sh', `make' and `cc'.

     $ wget -q http://josefsson.org/libidn/releases/libidn-0.6.14.tar.gz
     $ tar xfz libidn-0.6.14.tar.gz
     $ cd libidn-0.6.14/
     $ ./configure
     ...
     $ make
     ...
     $ make install
     ...

   After that Libidn should be properly installed and ready for use.

   A few `configure' options may be relevant, summarized in the table.

`--enable-java'
     Build the Java port into a *.JAR file.  *Note Java API::, for more
     information.

`--disable-tld'
     Disable the TLD module.  This would typically only be useful if you
     are building on a memory restricted platforms.  *Note TLD
     Functions::, for more information.

`--enable-csharp[=IMPL]'
     Build the C3 port into a *.DLL file.  *Note C# API::, for more
     information.  Here, `IMPL' is `pnet' or `mono', indicating whether
     the PNET `cscc' compiler or the Mono `mcs' compiler should be
     used, respectively.


   For the complete list, refer to the output from `configure --help'.

1.8 Bug Reports
===============

If you think you have found a bug in Libidn, please investigate it and
report it.

   * Please make sure that the bug is really in Libidn, and preferably
     also check that it hasn't already been fixed in the latest version.

   * You have to send us a test case that makes it possible for us to
     reproduce the bug.

   * You also have to explain what is wrong; if you get a crash, or if
     the results printed are not good and in that case, in what way.
     Make sure that the bug report includes all information you would
     need to fix this kind of bug for someone else.


   Please make an effort to produce a self-contained report, with
something definite that can be tested or debugged.  Vague queries or
piecemeal messages are difficult to act on and don't help the
development effort.

   If your bug report is good, we will do our best to help you to get a
corrected version of the software; if the bug report is poor, we won't
do anything about it (apart from asking you to send better bug reports).

   If you think something in this manual is unclear, or downright
incorrect, or if the language needs to be improved, please also send a
note.

   Send your bug report to:

                         `bug-libidn@gnu.org'


File: libidn.info,  Node: Contributing,  Prev: Bug Reports,  Up: Introduction

1.9 Contributing
================

If you want to submit a patch for inclusion - from solve a typo you
discovered, up to adding support for a new feature - you should submit
it as a bug report (*note Bug Reports::).  There are some things that
you can do to increase the chances for it to be included in the
official package.

   Unless your patch is very small (say, under 10 lines) we require that
you assign the copyright of your work to the Free Software Foundation.
This is to protect the freedom of the project.  If you have not already
signed papers, we will send you the necessary information when you
submit your contribution.

   For contributions that doesn't consist of actual programming code,
the only guidelines are common sense.  Use it.

   For code contributions, a number of style guides will help you:

   * Coding Style.  Follow the GNU Standards document (*note GNU Coding
     Standards: (standards)top.).

     If you normally code using another coding standard, there is no
     problem, but you should use `indent' to reformat the code (*note
     GNU Indent: (indent)top.) before submitting your work.

   * Use the unified diff format `diff -u'.

   * Return errors.  No reason whatsoever should abort the execution of
     the library.  Even memory allocation errors, e.g. when malloc
     return NULL, should work although result in an error code.

   * Design with thread safety in mind.  Don't use global variables and
     the like.

   * Avoid using the C math library.  It causes problems for embedded
     implementations, and in most situations it is very easy to avoid
     using it.

   * Document your functions.  Use comments before each function
     headers, that, if properly formatted, are extracted into GTK-DOC
     web pages.  Don't forget to update the Texinfo manual as well.

   * Supply a ChangeLog and NEWS entries, where appropriate.

2 Preparation
*************

To use `Libidn', you have to perform some changes to your sources and
the build system.  The necessary changes are small and explained in the
following sections.  At the end of this chapter, it is described how
the library is initialized, and how the requirements of the library are
verified.

   A faster way to find out how to adapt your application for use with
`Libidn' may be to look at the examples at the end of this manual
(*note Examples::).

* Menu:

* Header::
* Initialization::
* Version Check::
* Building the source::
* Autoconf tests::


File: libidn.info,  Node: Header,  Next: Initialization,  Up: Preparation

2.1 Header
==========

The library contains a few independent parts, and each part export the
interfaces (data types and functions) in a header file.  You must
include the appropriate header files in all programs using the library,
either directly or through some other header file, like this:

     #include <stringprep.h>

   The header files and the functions they define are categorized as
follows:

stringprep.h
     The low-level stringprep API entry point.  For IDN applications,
     this is usually invoked via IDNA. Some applications, specifically
     non-IDN ones, may want to prepare strings directly though, and
     should include this header file.

     The name space of the stringprep part of Libidn is `stringprep*'
     for function names, `Stringprep*' for data types and
     `STRINGPREP_*' for other symbols.  In addition, `_stringprep*' is
     reserved for internal use and should never be used by applications.

punycode.h
     The entry point to Punycode encoding and decoding functions.
     Normally punycode is used via the idna.h interface, but some
     application may want to perform raw punycode operations.

     The name space of the punycode part of Libidn is `punycode_*' for
     function names, `Punycode*' for data types and `PUNYCODE_*' for
     other symbols.  In addition, `_punycode*' is reserved for internal
     use and should never be used by applications.

idna.h
     The entry point to the IDNA functions.  This is the normal entry
     point for applications that need IDN functionality.

     The name space of the IDNA part of Libidn is `idna_*' for function
     names, `Idna*' for data types and `IDNA_*' for other symbols.  In
     addition, `_idna*' is reserved for internal use and should never
     be used by applications.

tld.h
     The entry point to the TLD functions.  Normal applications are not
     expected to need this functionality, but it is present for
     applications that are used by TLDs to validate customer input.

     The name space of the TLD part of Libidn is `tld_*' for function
     names, `Tld_*' for data types and `TLD_*' for other symbols.  In
     addition, `_tld*' is reserved for internal use and should never be
     used by applications.

pr29.h
     The entry point to the PR29 functions.  These functions are used to
     detect "problem sequences" (*note PR29 Functions::), mostly for use
     in security critical applications.

     The name space of the PR29 part of Libidn is `pr29_*' for function
     names, `Pr29_*' for data types and `PR29_*' for other symbols.  In
     addition, `_pr29*' is reserved for internal use and should never
     be used by applications.

2.2 Initialization
==================

Libidn is stateless and does not need any initialization.


File: libidn.info,  Node: Version Check,  Next: Building the source,  Prev: Initialization,  Up: Preparation

2.3 Version Check
=================

It is often desirable to check that the version of `Libidn' used is
indeed one which fits all requirements.  Even with binary compatibility
new features may have been introduced but due to problem with the
dynamic linker an old version is actually used.  So you may want to
check that the version is okay right after program startup.

stringprep_check_version
------------------------

 -- Function: const char * stringprep_check_version (const char *
          REQ_VERSION)
     REQ_VERSION: Required version number, or NULL.

     Check that the the version of the library is at minimum the
     requested one and return the version string; return NULL if the
     condition is not satisfied.  If a NULL is passed to this function,
     no check is done, but the version string is simply returned.

     See `STRINGPREP_VERSION' for a suitable `req_version' string.

     *Return value:* Version string of run-time library, or NULL if the
     run-time library does not meet the required version number.

   The normal way to use the function is to put something similar to the
following first in your `main':

       if (!stringprep_check_version (STRINGPREP_VERSION))
         {
           printf ("stringprep_check_version() failed:\n"
                   "Header file incompatible with shared library.\n");
           exit(1);
         }


File: libidn.info,  Node: Building the source,  Next: Autoconf tests,  Prev: Version Check,  Up: Preparation

2.4 Building the source
=======================

If you want to compile a source file including e.g. the `idna.h' header
file, you must make sure that the compiler can find it in the directory
hierarchy.  This is accomplished by adding the path to the directory in
which the header file is located to the compilers include file search
path (via the `-I' option).

   However, the path to the include file is determined at the time the
source is configured.  To solve this problem, `Libidn' uses the
external package `pkg-config' that knows the path to the include file
and other configuration options.  The options that need to be added to
the compiler invocation at compile time are output by the `--cflags'
option to `pkg-config libidn'.  The following example shows how it can
be used at the command line:

     gcc -c foo.c `pkg-config libidn --cflags`

   Adding the output of `pkg-config libidn --cflags' to the compilers
command line will ensure that the compiler can find e.g. the idna.h
header file.

   A similar problem occurs when linking the program with the library.
Again, the compiler has to find the library files.  For this to work,
the path to the library files has to be added to the library search
path (via the `-L' option).  For this, the option `--libs' to
`pkg-config libidn' can be used.  For convenience, this option also
outputs all other options that are required to link the program with
the `libidn' libarary.  The example shows how to link `foo.o' with the
`libidn' library to a program `foo'.

     gcc -o foo foo.o `pkg-config libidn --libs`

   Of course you can also combine both examples to a single command by
specifying both options to `pkg-config':

     gcc -o foo foo.c `pkg-config libidn --cflags --libs`

2.5 Autoconf tests
==================

If your project uses Autoconf (*note GNU Autoconf: (autoconf)top.)  to
check for installed libraries, you might find the following snippet
illustrative.  It add a new `configure' parameter `--with-libidn', and
check for `idna.h' and `-lidn' (possibly below the directory specified
as the optional argument to `--with-libidn'), and define the CPP symbol
`LIBIDN' if the library is found.  The default behaviour is to search
for the library and enable the functionality (that is, define the
symbol) when the library is found, but if you wish to make the default
behaviour of your package be that Libidn is not used (even if it is
installed on the system), change `libidn=yes' to `libidn=no' on the
third line.

     AC_ARG_WITH(libidn, AC_HELP_STRING([--with-libidn=[DIR]],
                                     [Support IDN (needs GNU Libidn)]),
       libidn=$withval, libidn=yes)
     if test "$libidn" != "no"; then
       if test "$libidn" != "yes"; then
         LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} -L$libidn/lib"
         CPPFLAGS="${CPPFLAGS} -I$libidn/include"
       fi
       AC_CHECK_HEADER(idna.h,
         AC_CHECK_LIB(idn, stringprep_check_version,
           [libidn=yes LIBS="${LIBS} -lidn"], libidn=no),
         libidn=no)
     fi
     if test "$libidn" != "no" ; then
       AC_DEFINE(LIBIDN, 1, [Define to 1 if you want IDN support.])
     else
       AC_MSG_WARN([Libidn not found])
     fi
     AC_MSG_CHECKING([if Libidn should be used])
     AC_MSG_RESULT($libidn)

   If you require that your users have installed `pkg-config' (which I
cannot recommend generally), the above can be done more easily as
follows.

     AC_ARG_WITH(libidn, AC_HELP_STRING([--with-libidn=[DIR]],
                                     [Support IDN (needs GNU Libidn)]),
       libidn=$withval, libidn=yes)
     if test "$libidn" != "no" ; then
       PKG_CHECK_MODULES(LIBIDN, libidn >= 0.0.0, [libidn=yes], [libidn=no])
       if test "$libidn" != "yes" ; then
         libidn=no
         AC_MSG_WARN([Libidn not found])
       else
         libidn=yes
         AC_DEFINE(LIBIDN, 1, [Define to 1 if you want Libidn.])
       fi
     fi
     AC_MSG_CHECKING([if Libidn should be used])
     AC_MSG_RESULT($libidn)

3 Utility Functions
*******************

The rest of this library makes extensive use of Unicode characters.  In
order to interface this library with the outside world, your
application may need to make various Unicode transformations.

3.1 Header file `stringprep.h'
==============================

To use the functions explained in this chapter, you need to include the
file `stringprep.h' using:

     #include <stringprep.h>

3.2 Unicode Encoding Transformation
===================================

stringprep_unichar_to_utf8
--------------------------

 -- Function: int stringprep_unichar_to_utf8 (uint32_t C, char * OUTBUF)
     C: a ISO10646 character code

     OUTBUF: output buffer, must have at least 6 bytes of space.  If
     `NULL', the length will be computed and returned and nothing will
     be written to `outbuf'.

     Converts a single character to UTF-8.

     *Return value:* number of bytes written.

stringprep_utf8_to_unichar
--------------------------

 -- Function: uint32_t stringprep_utf8_to_unichar (const char * P)
     P: a pointer to Unicode character encoded as UTF-8

     Converts a sequence of bytes encoded as UTF-8 to a Unicode
     character.  If `p' does not point to a valid UTF-8 encoded
     character, results are undefined.

     *Return value:* the resulting character.

stringprep_ucs4_to_utf8
-----------------------

 -- Function: char * stringprep_ucs4_to_utf8 (const uint32_t * STR,
          ssize_t LEN, size_t * ITEMS_READ, size_t * ITEMS_WRITTEN)
     STR: a UCS-4 encoded string

     LEN: the maximum length of `str' to use. If `len' < 0, then the
     string is terminated with a 0 character.

     ITEMS_READ: location to store number of characters read read, or
     `NULL'.

     ITEMS_WRITTEN: location to store number of bytes written or `NULL'.
     The value here stored does not include the trailing 0 byte.

     Convert a string from a 32-bit fixed width representation as UCS-4.
     to UTF-8. The result will be terminated with a 0 byte.

     *Return value:* a pointer to a newly allocated UTF-8 string.  This
     value must be freed with `free()'. If an error occurs, `NULL' will
     be returned and `error' set.

stringprep_utf8_to_ucs4
-----------------------

 -- Function: uint32_t * stringprep_utf8_to_ucs4 (const char * STR,
          ssize_t LEN, size_t * ITEMS_WRITTEN)
     STR: a UTF-8 encoded string

     LEN: the maximum length of `str' to use. If `len' < 0, then the
     string is nul-terminated.

     ITEMS_WRITTEN: location to store the number of characters in the
     result, or `NULL'.

     Convert a string from UTF-8 to a 32-bit fixed width representation
     as UCS-4, assuming valid UTF-8 input.  This function does no error
     checking on the input.

     *Return value:* a pointer to a newly allocated UCS-4 string.  This
     value must be freed with `free()'.

3.3 Unicode Normalization
=========================

stringprep_ucs4_nfkc_normalize
------------------------------

 -- Function: uint32_t * stringprep_ucs4_nfkc_normalize (uint32_t *
          STR, ssize_t LEN)
     STR: a Unicode string.

     LEN: length of `str' array, or -1 if `str' is nul-terminated.

     Converts UCS4 string into UTF-8 and runs
     `stringprep_utf8_nfkc_normalize()'.

     *Return value:* a newly allocated Unicode string, that is the NFKC
     normalized form of `str'.

stringprep_utf8_nfkc_normalize
------------------------------

 -- Function: char * stringprep_utf8_nfkc_normalize (const char * STR,
          ssize_t LEN)
     STR: a UTF-8 encoded string.

     LEN: length of `str', in bytes, or -1 if `str' is nul-terminated.

     Converts a string into canonical form, standardizing such issues
     as whether a character with an accent is represented as a base
     character and combining accent or as a single precomposed
     character.

     The normalization mode is NFKC (ALL COMPOSE).  It standardizes
     differences that do not affect the text content, such as the
     above-mentioned accent representation. It standardizes the
     "compatibility" characters in Unicode, such as SUPERSCRIPT THREE to
     the standard forms (in this case DIGIT THREE). Formatting
     information may be lost but for most text operations such
     characters should be considered the same. It returns a result with
     composed forms rather than a maximally decomposed form.

     *Return value:* a newly allocated string, that is the NFKC
     normalized form of `str'.

3.4 Character Set Conversion
============================

stringprep_locale_charset
-------------------------

 -- Function: const char * stringprep_locale_charset ( VOID)
     Find out current locale charset.  The function respect the CHARSET
     environment variable, but typically uses nl_langinfo(CODESET) when
     it is supported.  It fall back on "ASCII" if CHARSET isn't set and
     nl_langinfo isn't supported or return anything.

     Note that this function return the application's locale's preferred
     charset (or thread's locale's preffered charset, if your system
     support thread-specific locales).  It does not return what the
     system may be using.  Thus, if you receive data from external
     sources you cannot in general use this function to guess what
     charset it is encoded in.  Use stringprep_convert from the external
     representation into the charset returned by this function, to have
     data in the locale encoding.

     *Return value:* Return the character set used by the current
     locale.  It will never return NULL, but use "ASCII" as a fallback.

stringprep_convert
------------------

 -- Function: char * stringprep_convert (const char * STR, const char *
          TO_CODESET, const char * FROM_CODESET)
     STR: input zero-terminated string.

     TO_CODESET: name of destination character set.

     FROM_CODESET: name of origin character set, as used by `str'.

     Convert the string from one character set to another using the
     system's `iconv()' function.

     *Return value:* Returns newly allocated zero-terminated string
     which is `str' transcoded into to_codeset.

stringprep_locale_to_utf8
-------------------------

 -- Function: char * stringprep_locale_to_utf8 (const char * STR)
     STR: input zero terminated string.

     Convert string encoded in the locale's character set into UTF-8 by
     using `stringprep_convert()'.

     *Return value:* Returns newly allocated zero-terminated string
     which is `str' transcoded into UTF-8.

stringprep_utf8_to_locale
-------------------------

 -- Function: char * stringprep_utf8_to_locale (const char * STR)
     STR: input zero terminated string.

     Convert string encoded in UTF-8 into the locale's character set by
     using `stringprep_convert()'.

     *Return value:* Returns newly allocated zero-terminated string
     which is `str' transcoded into the locale's character set.

4 Stringprep Functions
**********************

Stringprep describes a framework for preparing Unicode text strings in
order to increase the likelihood that string input and string
comparison work in ways that make sense for typical users throughout
the world. The stringprep protocol is useful for protocol identifier
values, company and personal names, internationalized domain names, and
other text strings.

4.1 Header file `stringprep.h'
==============================

To use the functions explained in this chapter, you need to include the
file `stringprep.h' using:

     #include <stringprep.h>

4.2 Defining A Stringprep Profile
=================================

Further types and structures are defined for applications that want to
specify their own stringprep profile.  As these are fairly obscure, and
by necessity tied to the implementation, we do not document them here.
Look into the `stringprep.h' header file, and the `profiles.c' source
code for the details.

4.3 Control Flags
=================

 -- Stringprep flags: Stringprep_profile_flags STRINGPREP_NO_NFKC
     Disable the NFKC normalization, as well as selecting the non-NFKC
     case folding tables.  Usually the profile specifies BIDI and NFKC
     settings, and applications should not override it unless in
     special situations.

 -- Stringprep flags: Stringprep_profile_flags STRINGPREP_NO_BIDI
     Disable the BIDI step.  Usually the profile specifies BIDI and NFKC
     settings, and applications should not override it unless in special
     situations.

 -- Stringprep flags: Stringprep_profile_flags STRINGPREP_NO_UNASSIGNED
     Make the library return with an error if string contains unassigned
     characters according to profile.

4.4 Core Functions
==================

stringprep_4i
-------------

 -- Function: int stringprep_4i (uint32_t * UCS4, size_t * LEN, size_t
          MAXUCS4LEN, Stringprep_profile_flags FLAGS, const
          Stringprep_profile * PROFILE)
     UCS4: input/output array with string to prepare.

     LEN: on input, length of input array with Unicode code points, on
     exit, length of output array with Unicode code points.

     MAXUCS4LEN: maximum length of input/output array.

     FLAGS: a `Stringprep_profile_flags' value, or 0.

     PROFILE: pointer to `Stringprep_profile' to use.

     Prepare the input UCS-4 string according to the stringprep profile,
     and write back the result to the input string.

     The input is not required to be zero terminated (`ucs4'[`len'] =
     0).  The output will not be zero terminated unless `ucs4'[`len'] =
     0.  Instead, see `stringprep_4zi()' if your input is zero
     terminated or if you want the output to be.

     Since the stringprep operation can expand the string, `maxucs4len'
     indicate how large the buffer holding the string is.  This function
     will not read or write to code points outside that size.

     The `flags' are one of `Stringprep_profile_flags' values, or 0.

     The `profile' contain the `Stringprep_profile' instructions to
     perform.  Your application can define new profiles, possibly
     re-using the generic stringprep tables that always will be part of
     the library, or use one of the currently supported profiles.

     *Return value:* Returns `STRINGPREP_OK' iff successful, or an
     `Stringprep_rc' error code.

stringprep_4zi
--------------

 -- Function: int stringprep_4zi (uint32_t * UCS4, size_t MAXUCS4LEN,
          Stringprep_profile_flags FLAGS, const Stringprep_profile *
          PROFILE)
     UCS4: input/output array with zero terminated string to prepare.

     MAXUCS4LEN: maximum length of input/output array.

     FLAGS: a `Stringprep_profile_flags' value, or 0.

     PROFILE: pointer to `Stringprep_profile' to use.

     Prepare the input zero terminated UCS-4 string according to the
     stringprep profile, and write back the result to the input string.

     Since the stringprep operation can expand the string, `maxucs4len'
     indicate how large the buffer holding the string is.  This function
     will not read or write to code points outside that size.

     The `flags' are one of `Stringprep_profile_flags' values, or 0.

     The `profile' contain the `Stringprep_profile' instructions to
     perform.  Your application can define new profiles, possibly
     re-using the generic stringprep tables that always will be part of
     the library, or use one of the currently supported profiles.

     *Return value:* Returns `STRINGPREP_OK' iff successful, or an
     `Stringprep_rc' error code.

stringprep
----------

 -- Function: int stringprep (char * IN, size_t MAXLEN,
          Stringprep_profile_flags FLAGS, const Stringprep_profile *
          PROFILE)
     IN: input/ouput array with string to prepare.

     MAXLEN: maximum length of input/output array.

     FLAGS: a `Stringprep_profile_flags' value, or 0.

     PROFILE: pointer to `Stringprep_profile' to use.

     Prepare the input zero terminated UTF-8 string according to the
     stringprep profile, and write back the result to the input string.

     Note that you must convert strings entered in the systems locale
     into UTF-8 before using this function, see
     `stringprep_locale_to_utf8()'.

     Since the stringprep operation can expand the string, `maxlen'
     indicate how large the buffer holding the string is.  This function
     will not read or write to characters outside that size.

     The `flags' are one of `Stringprep_profile_flags' values, or 0.

     The `profile' contain the `Stringprep_profile' instructions to
     perform.  Your application can define new profiles, possibly
     re-using the generic stringprep tables that always will be part of
     the library, or use one of the currently supported profiles.

     *Return value:* Returns `STRINGPREP_OK' iff successful, or an
     error code.

stringprep_profile
------------------

 -- Function: int stringprep_profile (const char * IN, char ** OUT,
          const char * PROFILE, Stringprep_profile_flags FLAGS)
     IN: input array with UTF-8 string to prepare.

     OUT: output variable with pointer to newly allocate string.

     PROFILE: name of stringprep profile to use.

     FLAGS: a `Stringprep_profile_flags' value, or 0.

     Prepare the input zero terminated UTF-8 string according to the
     stringprep profile, and return the result in a newly allocated
     variable.

     Note that you must convert strings entered in the systems locale
     into UTF-8 before using this function, see
     `stringprep_locale_to_utf8()'.

     The output `out' variable must be deallocated by the caller.

     The `flags' are one of `Stringprep_profile_flags' values, or 0.

     The `profile' specifies the name of the stringprep profile to use.
     It must be one of the internally supported stringprep profiles.

     *Return value:* Returns `STRINGPREP_OK' iff successful, or an
     error code.

4.5 Error Handling
==================

stringprep_strerror
-------------------

 -- Function: const char * stringprep_strerror (Stringprep_rc RC)
     RC: a `Stringprep_rc' return code.

     Convert a return code integer to a text string.  This string can be
     used to output a diagnostic message to the user.

     *STRINGPREP_OK:* Successful operation.  This value is guaranteed to
     always be zero, the remaining ones are only guaranteed to hold
     non-zero values, for logical comparison purposes.

     *STRINGPREP_CONTAINS_UNASSIGNED:* String contain unassigned Unicode
     code points, which is forbidden by the profile.

     *STRINGPREP_CONTAINS_PROHIBITED:* String contain code points
     prohibited by the profile.

     *STRINGPREP_BIDI_BOTH_L_AND_RAL:* String contain code points with

     points detected by bidirectional code.

     *STRINGPREP_TOO_SMALL_BUFFER:* Buffer handed to function was too
     small.  This usually indicate a problem in the calling application.

     *STRINGPREP_PROFILE_ERROR:* The stringprep profile was
     inconsistent.  This usually indicate an internal error in the
     library.

     *STRINGPREP_FLAG_ERROR:* The supplied flag conflicted with profile.
     This usually indicate a problem in the calling application.

     *STRINGPREP_UNKNOWN_PROFILE:* The supplied profile name was not
     known to the library.

     *STRINGPREP_NFKC_FAILED:* The Unicode NFKC operation failed.  This
     usually indicate an internal error in the library.

     *STRINGPREP_MALLOC_ERROR:* The `malloc()' was out of memory.  This
     is usually a fatal error.

     *Return value:* Returns a pointer to a statically allocated string
     containing a description of the error with the return code `rc'.

5 Punycode Functions
********************

Punycode is a simple and efficient transfer encoding syntax designed
for use with Internationalized Domain Names in Applications. It
uniquely and reversibly transforms a Unicode string into an ASCII
string. ASCII characters in the Unicode string are represented
literally, and non-ASCII characters are represented by ASCII characters
that are allowed in host name labels (letters, digits, and hyphens). A
general algorithm called Bootstring allows a string of basic code
points to uniquely represent any string of code points drawn from a
larger set. Punycode is an instance of Bootstring that uses particular
parameter values, appropriate for IDNA.

5.1 Header file `punycode.h'
============================

To use the functions explained in this chapter, you need to include the
file `punycode.h' using:

     #include <punycode.h>

5.2 Unicode Code Point Data Type
================================

The punycode function uses a special type to denote Unicode code
points.  It is guaranteed to always be a 32 bit unsigned integer.

 -- Punycode Unicode code point: uint32_t punycode_uint
     A unsigned integer that hold Unicode code points.

5.3 Core Functions
==================

Note that the current implementation will fail if the `input_length'
exceed 4294967295 (the size of `punycode_uint').  This restriction may
be removed in the future.  Meanwhile applications are encouraged to not
depend on this problem, and use `sizeof' to initialize `input_length'
and `output_length'.

   The functions provided are the following two entry points:

punycode_encode
---------------

 -- Function: int punycode_encode (size_t INPUT_LENGTH, const
          punycode_uint [] INPUT, const unsigned char [] CASE_FLAGS,
          size_t * OUTPUT_LENGTH, char [] OUTPUT)
     INPUT_LENGTH: The number of code points in the `input' array and
     the number of flags in the `case_flags' array.

     INPUT: An array of code points.  They are presumed to be Unicode
     code points, but that is not strictly REQUIRED.  The array
     contains code points, not code units.  UTF-16 uses code units D800
     through DFFF to refer to code points 10000..10FFFF.  The code
     points D800..DFFF do not occur in any valid Unicode string.  The
     code points that can occur in Unicode strings (0..D7FF and
     E000..10FFFF) are also called Unicode scalar values.

     CASE_FLAGS: A `NULL' pointer or an array of boolean values parallel
     to the `input' array.  Nonzero (true, flagged) suggests that the
     corresponding Unicode character be forced to uppercase after being
     decoded (if possible), and zero (false, unflagged) suggests that
     it be forced to lowercase (if possible).  ASCII code points
     (0..7F) are encoded literally, except that ASCII letters are
     forced to uppercase or lowercase according to the corresponding
     case flags.  If `case_flags' is a `NULL' pointer then ASCII letters
     are left as they are, and other code points are treated as
     unflagged.

     OUTPUT_LENGTH: The caller passes in the maximum number of ASCII
     code points that it can receive.  On successful return it will
     contain the number of ASCII code points actually output.

     OUTPUT: An array of ASCII code points.  It is *not*
     null-terminated; it will contain zeros if and only if the `input'
     contains zeros.  (Of course the caller can leave room for a
     terminator and add one if needed.)

     Converts a sequence of code points (presumed to be Unicode code
     points) to Punycode.

     *Return value:* The return value can be any of the
     `Punycode_status' values defined above except
     `PUNYCODE_BAD_INPUT'.  If not `PUNYCODE_SUCCESS', then
     `output_size' and `output' might contain garbage.

punycode_decode
---------------

 -- Function: int punycode_decode (size_t INPUT_LENGTH, const char []
          INPUT, size_t * OUTPUT_LENGTH, punycode_uint [] OUTPUT,
          unsigned char [] CASE_FLAGS)
     INPUT_LENGTH: The number of ASCII code points in the `input' array.

     INPUT: An array of ASCII code points (0..7F).

     OUTPUT_LENGTH: The caller passes in the maximum number of code
     points that it can receive into the `output' array (which is also
     the maximum number of flags that it can receive into the
     `case_flags' array, if `case_flags' is not a `NULL' pointer).  On
     successful return it will contain the number of code points
     actually output (which is also the number of flags actually
     output, if case_flags is not a null pointer).  The decoder will
     never need to output more code points than the number of ASCII
     code points in the input, because of the way the encoding is
     defined.  The number of code points output cannot exceed the
     maximum possible value of a punycode_uint, even if the supplied
     `output_length' is greater than that.

     OUTPUT: An array of code points like the input argument of
     `punycode_encode()' (see above).

     CASE_FLAGS: A `NULL' pointer (if the flags are not needed by the
     caller) or an array of boolean values parallel to the `output'
     array.  Nonzero (true, flagged) suggests that the corresponding
     Unicode character be forced to uppercase by the caller (if
     possible), and zero (false, unflagged) suggests that it be forced
     to lowercase (if possible).  ASCII code points (0..7F) are output
     already in the proper case, but their flags will be set
     appropriately so that applying the flags would be harmless.

     Converts Punycode to a sequence of code points (presumed to be
     Unicode code points).

     *Return value:* The return value can be any of the
     `Punycode_status' values defined above.  If not
     `PUNYCODE_SUCCESS', then `output_length', `output', and
     `case_flags' might contain garbage.

5.4 Error Handling
==================

punycode_strerror
-----------------

 -- Function: const char * punycode_strerror (Punycode_status RC)
     RC: an `Punycode_status' return code.

     Convert a return code integer to a text string.  This string can be
     used to output a diagnostic message to the user.

     *PUNYCODE_SUCCESS:* Successful operation.  This value is guaranteed
     to always be zero, the remaining ones are only guaranteed to hold
     non-zero values, for logical comparison purposes.

     *PUNYCODE_BAD_INPUT:* Input is invalid.

     *PUNYCODE_BIG_OUTPUT:* Output would exceed the space provided.

     *PUNYCODE_OVERFLOW:* Input needs wider integers to process.

     *Return value:* Returns a pointer to a statically allocated string
     containing a description of the error with the return code `rc'.

6 IDNA Functions
****************

Until now, there has been no standard method for domain names to use
characters outside the ASCII repertoire. The IDNA document defines
internationalized domain names (IDNs) and a mechanism called IDNA for
handling them in a standard fashion. IDNs use characters drawn from a
large repertoire (Unicode), but IDNA allows the non-ASCII characters to
be represented using only the ASCII characters already allowed in
so-called host names today. This backward-compatible representation is
required in existing protocols like DNS, so that IDNs can be introduced
with no changes to the existing infrastructure. IDNA is only meant for
processing domain names, not free text.

6.1 Header file `idna.h'
========================

To use the functions explained in this chapter, you need to include the
file `idna.h' using:

     #include <idna.h>

6.2 Control Flags
=================

The IDNA `flags' parameter can take on the following values, or a
bit-wise inclusive or of any subset of the parameters:

 -- Return code: Idna_flags IDNA_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED
     Allow unassigned Unicode code points.

 -- Return code: Idna_flags IDNA_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES
     Check output to make sure it is a STD3 conforming host name.

6.3 Prefix String
=================

 -- Macro: #define IDNA_ACE_PREFIX
     String with the official IDNA prefix, `xn--'.

6.4 Core Functions
==================

The idea behind the IDNA function names are as follows: the
`idna_to_ascii_4i' and `idna_to_unicode_44i' functions are the core
IDNA primitives.  The `4' indicate that the function takes UCS-4
strings (i.e., Unicode code points encoded in a 32-bit unsigned integer
type) of the specified length.  The `i' indicate that the data is
written "inline" into the buffer.  This means the caller is responsible
for allocating (and deallocating) the string, and providing the library
with the allocated length of the string.  The output length is written
in the output length variable.  The remaining functions all contain the
`z' indicator, which means the strings are zero terminated.  All output
strings are allocated by the library, and must be deallocated by the
caller.  The `4' indicator again means that the string is UCS-4, the
`8' means the strings are UTF-8 and the `l' indicator means the strings
are encoded in the encoding used by the current locale.

   The functions provided are the following entry points:

idna_to_ascii_4i
----------------

 -- Function: int idna_to_ascii_4i (const uint32_t * IN, size_t INLEN,
          char * OUT, int FLAGS)
     IN: input array with unicode code points.

     INLEN: length of input array with unicode code points.

     OUT: output zero terminated string that must have room for at
     least 63 characters plus the terminating zero.

     FLAGS: an `Idna_flags' value, e.g., `IDNA_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED' or
     `IDNA_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES'.

     The ToASCII operation takes a sequence of Unicode code points that
     make up one label and transforms it into a sequence of code points
     in the ASCII range (0..7F). If ToASCII succeeds, the original
     sequence and the resulting sequence are equivalent labels.

     It is important to note that the ToASCII operation can fail.
     ToASCII fails if any step of it fails. If any step of the ToASCII
     operation fails on any label in a domain name, that domain name
     MUST NOT be used as an internationalized domain name. The method
     for deadling with this failure is application-specific.

     The inputs to ToASCII are a sequence of code points, the
     AllowUnassigned flag, and the UseSTD3ASCIIRules flag. The output
     of ToASCII is either a sequence of ASCII code points or a failure
     condition.

     ToASCII never alters a sequence of code points that are all in the
     ASCII range to begin with (although it could fail). Applying the
     ToASCII operation multiple times has exactly the same effect as
     applying it just once.

     *Return value:* Returns 0 on success, or an `Idna_rc' error code.

idna_to_unicode_44i
-------------------

 -- Function: int idna_to_unicode_44i (const uint32_t * IN, size_t
          INLEN, uint32_t * OUT, size_t * OUTLEN, int FLAGS)
     IN: input array with unicode code points.

     INLEN: length of input array with unicode code points.

     OUT: output array with unicode code points.

     OUTLEN: on input, maximum size of output array with unicode code
     points, on exit, actual size of output array with unicode code
     points.

     FLAGS: an `Idna_flags' value, e.g., `IDNA_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED' or
     `IDNA_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES'.

     The ToUnicode operation takes a sequence of Unicode code points
     that make up one label and returns a sequence of Unicode code
     points. If the input sequence is a label in ACE form, then the
     result is an equivalent internationalized label that is not in ACE
     form, otherwise the original sequence is returned unaltered.

     ToUnicode never fails. If any step fails, then the original input
     sequence is returned immediately in that step.

     The Punycode decoder can never output more code points than it
     inputs, but Nameprep can, and therefore ToUnicode can.  Note that
     the number of octets needed to represent a sequence of code points
     depends on the particular character encoding used.

     The inputs to ToUnicode are a sequence of code points, the
     AllowUnassigned flag, and the UseSTD3ASCIIRules flag. The output of
     ToUnicode is always a sequence of Unicode code points.

     *Return value:* Returns `Idna_rc' error condition, but it must
     only be used for debugging purposes.  The output buffer is always
     guaranteed to contain the correct data according to the
     specification (sans malloc induced errors).  NB!  This means that
     you normally ignore the return code from this function, as
     checking it means breaking the standard.

7 TLD Functions
***************

Organizations that manage some Top Level Domains (TLDs) have published
tables with characters they accept within the domain.  The reason may
be to reduce complexity that come from using the full Unicode range,
and to protect themselves from future (backwards incompatible) changes
in the IDN or Unicode specifications.  Libidn implement an
infrastructure for defining and checking strings against such tables.
Libidn also ship some tables from TLDs that we have managed to get
permission to use them from.  Because these tables are even less static
than Unicode or StringPrep tables, it is likely that they will be
updated from time to time (even in backwards incompatibe ways).  The
Libidn interface provide a "version" field for each TLD table, which
can be compared for equality to guarantee the same operation over time.

   From a design point of view, you can regard the TLD tables for IDN
as the "localization" step that come after the "internationalization"
step provided by the IETF standards.

   The TLD functionality rely on up-to-date tables.  The latest version
of Libidn aim to provide these, but tables with unclear copying
conditions, or generally experimental tables, are not included.  Some
such tables can be found at `http://tldchk.berlios.de'.

     string.

     *Return value:* Returns the `Tld_rc' value `TLD_SUCCESS' if all
     characters are valid or when `tld' is null, `TLD_INVALID' if a
     character is not allowed, or additional error codes on general
     failure conditions.

tld_check_lz
------------

 -- Function: int tld_check_lz (const char * IN, size_t * ERRPOS, const
          Tld_table ** OVERRIDES)
     IN: Zero-terminated string in the current locales encoding to
     process.

     ERRPOS: Position of offending character is returned here.

     OVERRIDES: A `Tld_table' array of additional domain restriction
     structures that complement and supersede the built-in information.

     Test each of the characters in `in' for whether or not they are
     allowed by the information in `overrides' or by the built-in TLD
     restriction data. When data for the same TLD is available both
     internally and in `overrides', the information in `overrides' takes
     precedence. If several entries for a specific TLD are found, the
     first one is used.  If `overrides' is `NULL', only the built-in
     information is used.  The position of the first offending character
     is returned in `errpos'.  Note that the error position refers to
     the decoded character offset rather than the byte position in the
     string.

     *Return value:* Returns the `Tld_rc' value `TLD_SUCCESS' if all
     characters are valid or when `tld' is null, `TLD_INVALID' if a
     character is not allowed, or additional error codes on general
     failure conditions.

7.5 Error Handling
==================

tld_strerror
------------

 -- Function: const char * tld_strerror (Tld_rc RC)
     RC: tld return code

     Convert a return code integer to a text string.  This string can be
     used to output a diagnostic message to the user.

     *TLD_SUCCESS:* Successful operation.  This value is guaranteed to
     always be zero, the remaining ones are only guaranteed to hold
     non-zero values, for logical comparison purposes.

     *TLD_INVALID:* Invalid character found.

     *TLD_NODATA:* No input data was provided.

     *TLD_MALLOC_ERROR:* Error during memory allocation.

     *TLD_ICONV_ERROR:* Error during iconv string conversion.

     *TLD_NO_TLD:* No top-level domain found in domain string.

     *Return value:* Returns a pointer to a statically allocated string
     containing a description of the error with the return code `rc'.

8 PR29 Functions
****************

A deficiency in the specification of Unicode Normalization Forms has
been found.  The consequence is that some strings can be normalized
into different strings by different implementations.  In other words,
two different implementations may return different output for the same
input (because the interpretation of the specification is ambiguous).
Further, an implementation invoked again on the one of the output
strings may return a different string (because one of the
interpretation of the ambiguous specification make normalization
non-idempotent).  Fortunately, only a select few character sequence
exhibit this problem, and none of them are expected to occur in natural
languages (due to different linguistic uses of the involved characters).

   A full discussion of the problem may be found at:

   `http://www.unicode.org/review/pr-29.html'

   The PR29 functions below allow you to detect the problem sequence.
So when would you want to use these functions?  For most applications,
such as those using Nameprep for IDN, this is likely only to be an
interoperability problem.  Thus, you may not want to care about it, as
the character sequences will rarely occur naturally.  However, if you
are using a profile, such as SASLPrep, to process authentication
tokens; authorization tokens; or passwords, there is a real danger that
attackers may try to use the peculiarities in these strings to attack
parts of your system.  As only a small number of strings, and no
naturally occurring strings, exhibit this problem, the conservative
approach of rejecting the strings is recommended.  If this approach is
not used, you should instead verify that all parts of your system, that
process the tokens and passwords, use a NFKC implementation that
produce the same output for the same input.

   Technically inclined readers may be interested in knowing more about
the implementation aspects of the PR29 flaw. *Note PR29 discussion::.

8.1 Header file `pr29.h'
========================

To use the functions explained in this chapter, you need to include the
file `pr29.h' using:

     #include <pr29.h>

8.2 Core Functions
==================

pr29_4
------

 -- Function: int pr29_4 (const uint32_t * IN, size_t LEN)
     IN: input array with unicode code points.

     LEN: length of input array with unicode code points.

     Check the input to see if it may be normalized into different
     strings by different NFKC implementations, due to an anomaly in the
     NFKC specifications.

     *Return value:* Returns the `Pr29_rc' value `PR29_SUCCESS' on
     success, and `PR29_PROBLEM' if the input sequence is a "problem
     sequence" (i.e., may be normalized into different strings by
     different implementations).

8.3 Utility Functions
=====================

pr29_4z
-------

 -- Function: int pr29_4z (const uint32_t * IN)
     IN: zero terminated array of Unicode code points.

     Check the input to see if it may be normalized into different
     strings by different NFKC implementations, due to an anomaly in the
     NFKC specifications.

     *Return value:* Returns the `Pr29_rc' value `PR29_SUCCESS' on
     success, and `PR29_PROBLEM' if the input sequence is a "problem
     sequence" (i.e., may be normalized into different strings by
     different implementations).

pr29_8z
-------

 -- Function: int pr29_8z (const char * IN)
     IN: zero terminated input UTF-8 string.

     Check the input to see if it may be normalized into different
     strings by different NFKC implementations, due to an anomaly in the
     NFKC specifications.

     *Return value:* Returns the `Pr29_rc' value `PR29_SUCCESS' on
     success, and `PR29_PROBLEM' if the input sequence is a "problem
     sequence" (i.e., may be normalized into different strings by
     different implementations), or `PR29_STRINGPREP_ERROR' if there
     was a problem converting the string from UTF-8 to UCS-4.

8.4 Error Handling
==================

pr29_strerror
-------------

 -- Function: const char * pr29_strerror (Pr29_rc RC)
     RC: an `Pr29_rc' return code.

     Convert a return code integer to a text string.  This string can be
     used to output a diagnostic message to the user.

     *PR29_SUCCESS:* Successful operation.  This value is guaranteed to
     always be zero, the remaining ones are only guaranteed to hold
     non-zero values, for logical comparison purposes.

     *PR29_PROBLEM:* A problem sequence was encountered.

     *PR29_STRINGPREP_ERROR:* The character set conversion failed (only
     for `pr29_8()' and `pr29_8z()').

     *Return value:* Returns a pointer to a statically allocated string
     containing a description of the error with the return code `rc'.

10 Invoking idn
***************

10.1 Name
=========

GNU Libidn (idn) - Internationalized Domain Names command line tool

10.2 Description
================

`idn' allows internationalized string preparation (`stringprep'),
encoding and decoding of punycode data, and IDNA ToASCII/ToUnicode
operations to be performed on the command line.

   If strings are specified on the command line, they are used as input
and the computed output is printed to standard output `stdout'.  If no
strings are specified on the command line, the program read data, line
by line, from the standard input `stdin', and print the computed output
to standard output.  What processing is performed (e.g., ToASCII, or
Punycode encode) is indicated by options.  If any errors are
encountered, the execution of the applications is aborted.

   All strings are expected to be encoded in the preferred charset used
by your locale.  Use `--debug' to find out what this charset is.  You
can override the charset used by setting environment variable `CHARSET'.

   To process a string that starts with `-', for example `-foo', use
`--' to signal the end of parameters, as in `idn --quiet -a -- -foo'.

10.3 Options
============

`idn' recognizes these commands:


  -h, --help               Print help and exit

  -V, --version            Print version and exit

  -s, --stringprep         Prepare string according to nameprep profile

  -d, --punycode-decode    Decode Punycode

  -e, --punycode-encode    Encode Punycode

  -a, --idna-to-ascii      Convert to ACE according to IDNA (default)

  -u, --idna-to-unicode    Convert from ACE according to IDNA

      --allow-unassigned   Toggle IDNA AllowUnassigned flag  (default=off)

      --usestd3asciirules  Toggle IDNA UseSTD3ASCIIRules flag  (default=off)

  -t, --tld                Check string for TLD specific rules
                             Only for --idna-to-ascii and --idna-to-unicode
                             (default=on)

  -p, --profile=STRING     Use specified stringprep profile instead
                             Valid stringprep profiles are `Nameprep',
                             `iSCSI', `Nodeprep', `Resourceprep', `trace', and
                             `SASLprep'.

      --debug              Print debugging information  (default=off)

      --quiet              Silent operation  (default=off)

10.4 Environment Variables
==========================

The CHARSET environment variable can be used to override what character
set to be used for decoding incoming data (i.e., on the command line or
on the standard input stream), and to encode data to the standard
output.  If your system is set up correctly, however, the application
will guess which character set is used automatically.  Example usage:

     $ CHARSET=ISO-8859-1 idn --punycode-encode
     ...

10.5 Examples
=============

Standard usage, reading input from standard input:

     jas@latte:~$ idn

     xn--blbrgrd-fxak7p.no
     jas@latte:~$

   Accessing a specific StringPrep profile directly:

     jas@latte:~$ idn --quiet --profile=SASLprep --stringprep tessta
     tessta
     jas@latte:~$

10.6 Troubleshooting
====================

Getting character data encoded right, and making sure Libidn use the
same encoding, can be difficult.  The reason for this is that most
systems encode character data in more than one character encoding,
i.e., using `UTF-8' together with `ISO-8859-1' or `ISO-2022-JP'.  This
problem is likely to continue to exist until only one character
encoding come out as the evolutionary winner, or (more likely, at least
to some extents) forever.

   The first step to troubleshooting character encoding problems with
Libidn is to use the `--debug' parameter to find out which character
set encoding `idn' believe your locale uses.

     jas@latte:~$ idn --debug --quiet ""
     system locale uses charset `UTF-8'.

     jas@latte:~$

   If it prints `ANSI_X3.4-1968' (i.e., `US-ASCII'), this indicate you
have not configured your locale properly.  To configure the locale, you
can, for example, use `LANG=sv_SE.UTF-8; export LANG' at a `/bin/sh'
prompt, to set up your locale for a Swedish environment using `UTF-8'
as the encoding.

   Sometimes `idn' appear to be unable to translate from your system
locale into `UTF-8' (which is used internally), and you get an error
like the following:

     jas@latte:~$ idn --quiet foo
     idn: could not convert from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8.
     jas@latte:~$

   The simplest explanation is that you haven't installed the `iconv'
conversion tools.  You can find it as a standalone library in GNU
Libiconv (`http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/').  On many GNU/Linux
systems, this library is part of the system, but you may have to
install additional packages (e.g., `glibc-locale' for Debian) to be
able to use it.

   Another explanation is that the error is correct and you are feeding
`idn' invalid data.  This can happen inadvertently if you are not
careful with the character set encodings you use.  For example, if your
shell run in a `ISO-8859-1' environment, and you invoke `idn' with the
`CHARSET' environment variable as follows, you will feed it
`ISO-8859-1' characters but force it to believe they are `UTF-8'.
Naturally this will lead to an error, unless the byte sequences happen
to be parsable as `UTF-8'.  Note that even if you don't get an error,
the output may be incorrect in this situation, because `ISO-8859-1' and
`UTF-8' does not in general encode the same characters as the same byte
sequences.

     jas@latte:~$ idn --quiet --debug ""
     system locale uses charset `ISO-8859-1'.

     jas@latte:~$ CHARSET=UTF-8 idn --quiet --debug ra"ksmo"rgaas
     system locale uses charset `UTF-8'.
     input[0] = U+0072
     input[1] = U+4af3
     input[2] = U+006d
     input[3] = U+1b29e5
     input[4] = U+0073
     output[0] = U+0078
     output[1] = U+006e
     output[2] = U+002d
     output[3] = U+002d
     output[4] = U+0072
     output[5] = U+006d
     output[6] = U+0073
     output[7] = U+002d
     output[8] = U+0068
     output[9] = U+0069
     output[10] = U+0036
     output[11] = U+0064
     output[12] = U+0035
     output[13] = U+0039
     output[14] = U+0037
     output[15] = U+0035
     output[16] = U+0035
     output[17] = U+0032
     output[18] = U+0061
     xn--rms-hi6d597552a
     jas@latte:~$

   The sense moral here is to forget about `CHARSET' (configure your
locales properly instead) unless you know what you are doing, and if
you want to use it, do it carefully, after verifying with `--debug'
that you get the desired results.

11 Emacs API
************

Included in Libidn are `punycode.el' and `idna.el' that provides an
Emacs Lisp API to (a limited set of) the Libidn API.  This section
describes the API.  Currently the IDNA API always set the
`UseSTD3ASCIIRules' flag and clear the `AllowUnassigned' flag, in the
future there may be functionality to specify these flags via the API.

12 Java API
***********

Libidn has been ported to the Java programming language, and as a
consequence most of the API is available to native Java applications.
This section contain notes on this support, complete documentation is
pending.

   The Java library, if Libidn has been built with Java support (*note
Downloading and Installing::), will be placed in `java/libidn.jar'.
The source code is located in `java/gnu/inet/encoding/'.

12.1 Overview
=============

This package provides a Java implementation of the Internationalized
Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) standard. It is written entirely in
Java and does not require any additional libraries to be set up.

   The gnu.inet.encoding.IDNA class offers two public functions, toASCII
and toUnicode which can be used as follows:

     gnu.inet.encoding.IDNA.toASCII("blo"ds.zu"g");
     gnu.inet.encoding.IDNA.toUnicode("xn--blds-6qa.xn--zg-xka");

12.2 Miscellaneous Programs
===========================

The `misc/' directory contains several programs that are related to the
Java part of GNU Libidn, but that don't need to be included in the main
source tree.

12.2.1 GenerateRFC3454
----------------------

This program parses RFC3454 and creates the RFC3454.java program that
is required during the StringPrep phase.

   The RFC can be found at various locations, for example at
`http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3454.txt'.

   Invoke the program as follows:

     $ java GenerateRFC3454
     Creating RFC3454.java... Ok.

12.2.2 GenerateNFKC
-------------------

The GenerateNFKC program parses the Unicode character database file and
generates all the tables required for NFKC. This program requires the
two files UnicodeData.txt and CompositionExclusions.txt of version 3.2
of the Unicode files. Note that RFC3454 (Stringprep) defines that
Unicode version 3.2 is to be used, not the latest version.

   The Unicode data files can be found at
`http://www.unicode.org/Public/'.

   Invoke the program as follows:

     $ java GenerateNFKC
     Creating CombiningClass.java... Ok.
     Creating DecompositionKeys.java... Ok.
     Creating DecompositionMappings.java... Ok.
     Creating Composition.java... Ok.

12.2.3 TestIDNA
---------------

The TestIDNA program allows to test the IDNA implementation manually or
against Simon Josefsson's test vectors.

   The test vectors can be found at the Libidn homepage,
`http://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/'.

   To test the tranformation manually, use:

     $ java -cp .:../libidn.jar TestIDNA -a <string to test>
     Input: <string to test>
     Output: <toASCII(string to test)>
     $ java -cp .:../libidn.jar TestIDNA -u <string to test>
     Input: <string to test>
     Output: <toUnicode(string to test)>

   To test against draft-josefsson-idn-test-vectors.html, use:

     $ java -cp .:../libidn.jar TestIDNA -t
     No errors detected!

12.2.4 TestNFKC
---------------

The TestNFKC program allows to test the NFKC implementation manually or
against the NormalizationTest.txt file from the Unicode data files.

   To test the normalization manually, use:

     $ java -cp .:../libidn.jar TestNFKC <string to test>
     Input: <string to test>
     Output: <nfkc version of the string to test>

   To test against NormalizationTest.txt:

     $ java -cp .:../libidn.jar TestNFKC
     No errors detected!

12.3 Possible Problems
======================

Beware of Bugs: This Java API needs a lot more testing, especially with
"exotic" character sets. While it works for me, it may not work for you.

   Encoding of your Java sources: If you are using non-ASCII characters
in your Java source code, make sure javac compiles your programs with
the correct encoding. If necessary specify the encoding using the
-encoding parameter.

   Java Unicode handling: Java 1.4 only handles 16-bit Unicode code
points (i.e. characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane), this
implementation therefore ignores all references to so-called
Supplementary Characters (U+10000 to U+10FFFF). Starting from Java 1.5,
these characters will also be supported by Java, but this will require
changes to this library.  See also the next section.

12.4 A Note on Java and Unicode
===============================

This library uses Java's builtin 'char' datatype. Up to Java 1.4, this
datatype only supports 16-bit Unicode code points, also called the
Basic Multilingual Plane. For this reason, this library doesn't work
for Supplementary Characters (i.e. characters from U+10000 to
U+10FFFF). All references to such characters are silently ignored.

   Starting from Java 1.5, also Supplementary Characters will be
supported. However, this will require changes in the present version of
the library. Java 1.5 is currently in beta status.

   For more information refer to the documentation of
java.lang.Character in the JDK API.

13 C# API
*********

The Libidn library has been ported to the C# language.  The port reside
in the top-level `csharp/' directory.  Currently, no further
documentation about the implementation or the API is available.
However, the C# port was based on the Java port, and the API is exactly
the same as in the Java version.  The help files for the Java API may
thus be useful.

functions in Libidn. Your implementation was listed in the text of PR29 as
needing investigation, so I am following up on several implementations.

The UTC has accepted the proposed fix to D2 as outlined in PR29, and a new
draft of UAX #15 has been issued.

I have looked at Libidn 0.5.8 (today), and there may still be a possible
bug in NFKC.java and nfkc.c.

------------------------------------------------------

1. In NFKC.java, this line in canonicalOrdering():

      if (i > 0 && (last_cc == 0 || last_cc != cc)) {

should perhaps be changed to:

      if (i > 0 && (last_cc == 0 || last_cc < cc)) {

but I'm not sure of the sense of this comparison.

------------------------------------------------------

2. In nfkc.c, function _g_utf8_normalize_wc() has this code:

	  if (i > 0 &&
	      (last_cc == 0 || last_cc != cc) &&
	      combine (wc_buffer[last_start], wc_buffer[i],
		       &wc_buffer[last_start]))
	    {

This appears to have the same bug as the current Python implementation (in
Python 2.3.4). The code should be checking, as per new rule D2 UAX #15
update, that the next combining character is the same or HIGHER than the
current one. It now checks to see if it's non-zero and not equal.

The above line(s) should perhaps be changed to:

	  if (i > 0 &&
	      (last_cc == 0 || last_cc < cc) &&
	      combine (wc_buffer[last_start], wc_buffer[i],
		       &wc_buffer[last_start]))
	    {

but I'm not sure of the sense of the comparison (< or > or <=?) here.

In the text of PR29, I will be marking Libidn as "needs change" and adding
the version number that I checked. If any further change is made, please
let me know the release version, and I'll update again.

Regards,
	Rick McGowan

Hello Rick.

I believe the current behavior is intentional.  Libidn do not aim to
implement latest-and-greatest NFKC, it aim to implement the NFKC
functionality required for StringPrep and IDN.  As you may know,
StringPrep/IDN reference Unicode 3.2.0, and explicitly says any later
changes (which I consider PR29 as) do not apply.

In fact, I believe that would I incorporate the changes suggested in
PR29, I would in fact be violating the IDN specifications.

Thanks for looking into the code and finding the place where the
change could be made.  I'll see if I can mention this in the manual
somewhere, for technically interested readers.

Regards,
Simon

B.1 GNU Free Documentation License
==================================

                      Version 1.2, November 2002

     Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.

B.2 GNU Lesser General Public License
=====================================

                      Version 2.1, February 1999

     Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

     [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
     as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the
     version number 2.1.]

Preamble
--------

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses
are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software--typically libraries--of the Free
Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use
it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this
license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to
use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these
things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that
what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is
quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this
license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does _Less_ to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free
software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free
programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating
system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.

   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that
program using a modified version of the Library.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
---------------------------------------------------------------

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
     program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
     other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the
     terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this
     License").  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

     A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
     prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
     (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

     The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
     which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
     Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter,
     translation is included without limitation in the term
     "modification".)

     "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code
     means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
     associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
     control compilation and installation of the library.

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and
     output from such a program is covered only if its contents
     constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of
     the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true
     depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses
     the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
     complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
     that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
     appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
     intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
     absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License
     along with the Library.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. The modified work must itself be a software library.

       b. You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       c. You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
          charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       d. If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or
          a table of data to be supplied by an application program that
          uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the
          facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort
          to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply
          such function or table, the facility still operates, and
          performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

          (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots
          has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
          application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
          application-supplied function or table used by this function
          must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
          square root function must still compute square roots.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Library.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
     License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.
     To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this
     License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public
     License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer
     version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License
     has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you
     wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.

     Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
     that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to
     all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

     This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
     the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
     derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
     form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
     accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
     interchange.

     If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
     from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
     the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
     distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
     Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being
     compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the
     Library".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of
     the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

     However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
     creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because
     it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that
     uses the library".  The executable is therefore covered by this
     License.  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such
     executables.

     When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header
     file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may
     be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is
     not.  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work
     can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a
     library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
     defined by law.

     If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
     structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
     functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
     file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a
     derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus
     portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

     Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
     distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section
     6.  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
     whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
     link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
     work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
     under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
     modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
     engineering for debugging such modifications.

     You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered
     by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the
     work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include
     the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a
     reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also,
     you must do one of these things:

       a. Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
          machine-readable source code for the Library including
          whatever changes were used in the work (which must be
          distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work
          is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
          machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code
          and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library
          and then relink to produce a modified executable containing
          the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who
          changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will
          not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use
          the modified definitions.)

       b. Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
          Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run
          time a copy of the library already present on the user's
          computer system, rather than copying library functions into
          the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
          version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as
          the modified version is interface-compatible with the version
          that the work was made with.

       c. Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
          three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
          Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
          performing this distribution.

       d. If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
          from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the
          above specified materials from the same place.

       e. Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
          materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

     For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
     Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
     reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special
     exception, the materials to be distributed need not include
     anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
     form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of
     the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
     component itself accompanies the executable.

     It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
     restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
     accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you
     cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable
     that you distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
     Library side-by-side in a single library together with other
     library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
     such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution
     of the work based on the Library and of the other library
     facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these
     two things:

       a. Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
          based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
          facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
          Sections above.

       b. Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
          that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
          where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same
          work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
     Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
     attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
     distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate
     your rights under this License.  However, parties who have
     received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
     have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
     full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work
     based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
     Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the
     Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose
     any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties with this License.

 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Library.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Library under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
     Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
     but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Library specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library
     does not specify a license version number, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
     write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
     copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
     Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
     decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
     status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting
     the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
----------------------------------------------

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of
the ordinary General Public License).

   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have
at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is
found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE LIBRARY'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
     under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     Lesser General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301,
     USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library
     `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1990

B.3 GNU General Public License
==============================

                         Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
===============================================================

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=======================================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YYYY  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.
