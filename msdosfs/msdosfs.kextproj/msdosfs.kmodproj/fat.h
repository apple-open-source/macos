		Symbolic Links for FAT

FAT does not have native support for symbolic links (symlinks).  We
implement them using ordinary files with a particular format.  Our
symlink file format is modeled after the SMB for Mac OS X implementation.

Symlink files are ordinary text files that look like:

XSym
1234
00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF
/the/sym/link/path

The lines of the file are separated by ASCII newline (0x0A).  The first
line is a "magic" value to help identify the file.  The second line is
the length of the symlink itself; it is four decimal digits, with leading
zeroes.  The third line is the MD5 checksum of the symlink as 16
hexadecimal bytes.  The fourth line is the symlink, up to 1024 bytes long.
If the symlink is less than 1024 bytes, then it is padded with a single
newline character and as many spaces as needed to occupy 1024 bytes.

The file size is exactly 1067 (= 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 32 + 1 + 1024) bytes.
When we encounter an ordinary file whose length is 1067, we must read
it to verify that the header (including length and MD5 checksum) is
correct.

Since the file size is constant, we use the de_FileSize field in the
denode to store the actual length of the symlink.  That way, we only
check and parse the header once at vnode creation time.
