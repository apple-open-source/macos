.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
helps to coordinate the mounting, probing, and unmounting of msdos filesystems.  It essentially wraps
.Xr mount 8
and it's ilk in one interface that is generic enough for the disk mounter to work with, so that the underlying mount commands do not have to fit into one mold.  This allows us to more easily port mount commands without forcing us to reorder or redo the command itself or the disk mounter to understand each specific mount command.
