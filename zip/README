This is the "zip" project, which comprises both zip(1) and unzip(1),
and associated tools. The canonical home page for these tools are:

Zip: <http://www.info-zip.org/Zip.html>
UnZip: <http://www.info-zip.org/UnZip.html>

Currently, this project tracks:
Zip 2.32 (released 20 June 2005)
UnZip 5.52 (released 27 February 2005)

Imports should commit the new tarball, and change the makefiles
as appropriate.

Local modifications should be implemented as patches applied during build.
