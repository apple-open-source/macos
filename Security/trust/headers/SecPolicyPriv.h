    Additional policy values which your code can optionally set:

 CRL download.

 revocation checks only if the chain has no other validation errors. This flag
 overrides SecTrustSetNetworkFetchAllowed and kSecRevocationNetworkAccessDisabled
 for revocation checking (but not for intermediate fetching).
 Note that this flag's behavior is not default because revoked certs produce Fatal
 trust results, whereas most checks produce Recoverable trust results. If we skip
 revocation checks on untrusted chains, the user may be able to ignore the failures
 of a revoked cert.
