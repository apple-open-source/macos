     (leaf) to the anchor (or last certificate found if no anchor was found).

     array is an array of CFDictionaryRefs.  Each dictionary (we call it a
     property for short) has the following keys:

        kSecPropertyKeyType This key's value determines how this property

                be displayed in yellow with a warning triangle.

                The kSecPropertyKeyLocalizedLabel and kSecPropertyKeyLabel keys are not
                set.  The kSecPropertyKeyValue is a CFStringRef which should
                be displayed in red with an error X.
            kSecPropertyTypeSuccess
                The kSecPropertyKeyLocalizedLabel and kSecPropertyKeyLabel keys are not
                set.  The kSecPropertyKeyValue is a CFStringRef which should
                be displayed in green with a checkmark in front of it.
            kSecPropertyTypeTitle
                The kSecPropertyKeyLocalizedLabel and kSecPropertyKeyLabel keys are not
                set.  The kSecPropertyKeyValue is a CFStringRef which should
                be displayed in a larger bold font.
            kSecPropertyTypeSection
                The optional kSecPropertyKeyLocalizedLabel is a CFStringRef with the name
                of the next section to display.  The value of the
                kSecPropertyKeyValue key is a CFArrayRef which is a property
                array as defined here.
            kSecPropertyTypeData
                The optional kSecPropertyKeyLocalizedLabel is a CFStringRef containing
                the localized label for the value for the kSecPropertyKeyValue.
                The type of this value is a CFDataRef.  Its contents should be

                the UI will only show one line of hex dump data and have a
                disclosure arrow to see the remainder.
            kSecPropertyTypeString
                The optional kSecPropertyKeyLocalizedLabel is a CFStringRef containing
                the localized label for the value for the kSecPropertyKeyValue.
                The type of this value is a CFStringRef.  It's contents should be
                displayed in the normal font.
            kSecPropertyTypeURL
                The optional kSecPropertyKeyLocalizedLabel is a CFStringRef containing
                the localized label for the value for the kSecPropertyKeyValue.
                The type of this value is a CFURLRef.  It's contents should be
                displayed as a hyperlink.
            kSecPropertyTypeDate
                The optional kSecPropertyKeyLocalizedLabel is a CFStringRef containing
                the localized label for the value for the kSecPropertyKeyValue.
                The type of this value is a CFDateRef.  It's contents should be

        kSecPropertyKeyLocalizedLabel
            Human readable localized label for a given property.

            for this key is.
