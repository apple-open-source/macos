C++ Simple Example README
-------------------------

This directory should have 6 files in it:

  README      - this file

  genber.C    - C++ source code for a program that creates and encodes
                a PersonnelRecord value to a file.

  example.C   - C++ source code for a program that decodes a given
                PersonnelRecord value and re-encodes it to stdout.

  makefile    - compiles the example programs

  good_pr.ber - BER encoding of a Personnel Record (all definite lengths)



Type "make" to generate the 3 example programs:
        genber
        def
        indef



snacc is called from the makefile on .../asn1specs/p_rec.asn1 to
generate the following files:

p_rec.h  - C++ classes for PersonnelRecord types.

p_rec.C  - C++ source code for the PersonnelRecord encode, decode,
           print, and free methods.

These source files are then compiled with example.C to make the
programs def and indef.  Each program takes 1 argument, the name of a
file containing an BER encoded PersonnelRecord value.


Try the following:

%1 genber                       # create a file called pr.ber
%2 indef good_pr.ber > indef_pr.ber
%3 def indef_pr.ber > def_pr.ber
%4 diff good_pr.ber def_pr.ber  # should be no differences

(commands 2-4 can be made via the `check' phony target.)

The above commands decode the BER value in "good_pr.ber" and
indef_pr.ber respectively and then re-encode them to stdout.
Both programs will decode any valid BER representation of a
PersonnelRecord value but, the def program will re-encode the
given data using only the definite length BER format and the
indef program will re-encode the given data using only the
indefinite length BER format.

Compare the lengths of the def_pr.ber and indef_pr.ber files,
indefinite length encodings are usually larger.



Things to Note
--------------

Look at genber.C to see how to build a C++ value and then encode it.
look at the example.C file to see buffer usage.  Look at
.../c++_lib/inc/asn_config.h and .../c++_lib/inc/asn_buf.h if you
want to change the buffer managment.


Snacc ASN.1 comment commands

Notice the special "--snacc" ASN.1 comment in .../asn1specs/p_rec.asn1.

PersonnelRecord ::= --snacc isPdu:"TRUE" -- [APPLICATION 0] IMPLICIT SET
 { ... etc. ... }

The "isPdu" flag tells snacc that the PersonnelRecord is a PDU type.
This flag has no effect on the generated C++ code, since each type gets
PDU members automatically for C++.



Length formats

Both the def and indef programs were generated from the same source
file, example.c.  Indefinite length encoders can be created by giving
the -DUSE_INDEF_LEN flag to the C++ compiler when compiling.  Currently
the indefinite/definite length encoder choice is made a compile time.
To change this to a run-time decision, a simple solution would be to
modify BerEncodeConsLen and BerEncodeEocIfNec macros in
.../c++_lib/inc/asn_len.h to check a global flag.
