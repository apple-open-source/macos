//  This object transparently caches CKKSKey objects, with their key material
//  intact. Since those keys are loaded from the database, they remain
//  valid while you're in the database transaction where you loaded them.
//  To preverve this property, this cache must be destroyed before the end
//  of the database transaction in which it is created.
