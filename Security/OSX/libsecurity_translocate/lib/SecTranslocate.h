        Calls to this function and SecTranslocateDeleteSecureDirectory are serialized to ensure only one call to either
        is operating at a time.

        Requires entitlement "com.apple.private.app-translocation.create"

        Translocations will be created in the calling users's DARWIN_USER_TEMPDIR/AppTranslocation/<UUID>
 
        pathToTranslocated is expected to be of the form /some/dir/myApp.app
        destinationPath is expected to be of the form /<DARWIN_USER_TEMPDIR>/AppTranslocation/<DIR>/d/myApp.app

            <DIR> will be a UUID if destinationPath isn't specified.
 
        If pathToTranslocate is in a quarantined mountpoint, the quarantine attributes will be propagated to the
            translocated location.
 
        pathToTranslocate will cause a failure if it doesn't resolve to a path that exists, or it exceeds MAXPATHLEN
 
        destinationPath will cause a failure if
            1. it doesn't match the app (last directory) specified by path to translocate
            2. it differs from an already existing mount location for pathToTranslocate
            3. It isn't in the user's current temp dir

            5. It doesn't match the form /<DARWIN_USER_TEMPDIR>/AppTranslocation/<DIR>/d/myApp.app

        pathToTranslocate is returned if it should not be translocated based on policy. It is retained if so it can be treated as a copy.
