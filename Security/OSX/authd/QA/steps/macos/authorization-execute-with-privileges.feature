Feature: AEWP - Authorization Execute With Privileges 
  "AEWP" provides a way to run any executable with administrator or root privileges. 
  'AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges' function is deprecated, but a lot of 3rd party installers are still depending on it's functionality.

  Background: 
	  Given there is at least one administrator user account

  Scenario: AEWP - AppleScript 
    Given I open Terminal
    # osascript -e 'do shell script "whoami" with administrator privileges'
    And I run AppleScript with administrator privileges
    And I'm prompted with Authorization dialogue
    When I enter correct credentials
    # You should see output of "whoami" command if the command from above was used 
    Then I get correct output from the command
  
  Scenario Outline: AEWP - third-party Apps
  # Run 'apendix' (AppleInternal) - download 'Maya' & 'Reason' installer
  # Maya asks for AEWP during it's installation
  # Reason does not have an installer, instead you copy it Application folder. It asks for AEWP when you start the app
    Given I run <app> 
    And I'm prompted for admin Authorization
    When I enter correct credentials
    Then installation finishes succesfully

  Examples:
    | app | 
    | Maya installer |
    | Reason |
