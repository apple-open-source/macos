Feature: Authorization-driven screen unlock in MacOS
  Screen unlock is driven by the 'Authorization' since macOS Rome. Unlike usual authorizations, this one is divided between LoginWindow and the Authorization. LoginWindow displays UI and gathers credentials
  while Authorization evaluates provided credential. The right authorized for the screen unlock is 'system.login.screensaver'.

  Background:
    Given there is at least two administrator user accounts
    And there is at least two standard user accounts
