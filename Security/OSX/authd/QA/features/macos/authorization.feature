Feature: Authorization in MacOS
  'Authorization' is part of 'Security' framework. It has a set of rights and rules then allow/decline access to the user.  
  These rules and rights are stored in "Authorization Database (authdb)" 
  It relies on the Security Agent or LocalAuthentication as an interface layer and a way how to interact with user. 

  Background: 
    Given there is at least one administrator user account
    And there is at least one standard user account
