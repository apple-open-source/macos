Feature: SecurityAgent 3rd-party plugins
3rd-party plugins are stored in /Library/Security/SecurityAgentPlugins, as a .bundle files. 
For testing purposes, we will use NameAndPassword plugin which is used as example plugin on Apple dev portal: 
https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/samplecode/NameAndPassword/Introduction/Intro.html

  Background:
    # /Library/Security/SecurityAgentPlugins
    # To build the plugin, download the example project above, and build it in Xcode - you may need to change macOS SDK in project Build Settings as there is macOS SDK 10.15 hardcoded in the build settings, just pick 'macOS' from the dropdown menu.
    # You will find the .bundle file in Products folder of the project afterwards 
    Given plugin is stored in SecurityAgent plugins folder
    And FileVault is disabled
    # Scenarios below are modifying system.login.console right - there is a chance that you will make the device unable to land to LoginWindow or login if something goes wrong
    # Make sure that remote login is enabled:
    # SysPrefs -> Sharing -> Remote login enabled
    # Also, get the IP address of the device, as the domain address won't usually work in the corrupted state. You can find the IP in SysPrefs -> Network
    # In case something goes wrong, SSH to the device 'user@IP_address' and modify authdb back to it's original state:
    # $ sudo security authorizationdb write system.login.console <loginOrig.plist
    And remote login through SSH is enabled on the test device
  
  Scenario: Plugin is working in a standalone defined right
    # nameandpassword.plist
    # 
    # <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    # <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    # <plist version="1.0">
    # <dict>
    # <key>class</key>
    # <string>evaluate-mechanisms</string>
    # <key>mechanisms</key>
    # <array>
    # <string>NameAndPassword:invoke</string>
    # <string>builtin:authenticate,privileged</string>
    # </array>
    # <key>shared</key>
    # <false/>
    # </dict>
    # </plist>
    # 
    # Define new right:
    # $ sudo security authorizationdb write NameTestRight <nameandpassword.plist
    Given Standalone right is defined in authdb
    # $ security authorize -u NameTestRight
    # You will probably be alerted that the software is malicious - you have to go to the SysPrefs -> Security & Privacy and click "allow" on the bottom of the panel
    # After that, you will be again prompted when you call `security authorize` - now just click Open on the prompt dialog. You shouldn't be ever prompted since then when authorizing using this plugin
    And I authorize the new right
    # You should see unique UI, not similiar to anything you know from the system
    When I enter correct user credentials
    # security authorize returns:
    # YES (0)
    Then the authorization ends succesfully

  Scenario: Plugin used as part of login process in LoginWindow
    # $ security authorizationdb read system.login.console > loginOrig.plist
    # In the loginOrig.plist, modify 'loginwindow:login' to 'NameAndPassword:invoke' in the 'Mechanism' array. Save the file as loginModified.plist
    # $ sudo security authorizationdb write system.login.console <loginModified.plist
    Given I modify the 'system.login.console' to use 3rd party plugin
    And I reboot
    # You can check that the plugin is used when the password field is wide and doesn't fit the LoginWindow regular UI 
    And I land to LoginWindow
    When I enter user credentials
    # No logs like this should be present in the logs: 
    # (com.apple.CryptoTokenKit.ahp.agent): launchd.development[1]: Service did not exit 5 seconds after SIGTERM. Sending SIGKILL. 
    Then I succesfully login
