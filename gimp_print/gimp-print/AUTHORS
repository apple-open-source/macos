The original version, up to release 2.0, of the Gimp Print plug-in was
written by Mike Sweet <mike@easysw.com>.

Version 3.0, which is based on version 2, was written by Robert
Krawitz <rlk@alum.mit.edu> in late 1999, and frozen in early 2000.
The code was based on the 2.0 release.

Version 4.0 was developed by a team led by Robert Krawitz.  It was
released in November 2000.  We hosted the development on SourceForge,
a service provided to the free source community by VA Linux Systems.
The complete hosting service provided by SourceForge permitted the
development team to concentrate on improving the software rather than
having to worry about maintaining a development system.

Version 4.2 was developed by the same team, with some additions, and
was released in November 2001.  Roger Leigh in particular has
reimplemented the build system to match the GNU standard, making for a
far more flexible and powerful system.
