<P>
The initial problem is to calculate the starting position of each
pass; the row number of the printer's top jet when printing that pass.
Since we assume the paper cannot be reverse-fed, the print head must,
for each pass, start either further down the page than the previous
pass or at the same position.  Each pass's start point is therefore at
a non-negative offset from the previous pass's start point.

</P>
<P>
Once we have a formula for the starting row of each pass, we then turn
that "inside out" to get a formula for the pass number containing each
row.

</P>
<P>
First, let's define how our printer works.  We measure vertical
position on the paper in "rows"; the resolution with which the printer
can position the paper vertically.  The print head contains @math{J} ink
jets, which are spaced @math{S} rows apart.

</P>
<P>
Consider a very simple case: we want to print a page as quickly as
possible, and we mostly don't care how sparse the printing is, so long
as it's fairly even.

</P>
<P>
It's pretty obvious how to do this.  We make one pass with the print
head, printing @math{J} lines of data, each line @math{S} rows after the
previous one.  We then advance the paper by @math{S*J} rows and print
the next row.  For example, if @math{J=7} and @math{S=4}, this method
can be illustrated like this:

  \---------------------------/
     7*4=28 rows offset from one pass to the next
</PRE>

<P>
In these examples, the vertical axis can be thought of as the time axis,
with the pass number shown at the left margin, while the row number runs
horizontally.  A <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> shows each row printed by a pass, and a row of
<SAMP>`-'</SAMP> is used to link together the rows printed by one pass of the
print head.  The first pass is numbered <SAMP>`0'</SAMP> and starts at row 0.
Each subsequent pass @math{p} starts at row @math{p*S*J}.  Each pass
prints @math{J} lines, each line being @math{S} rows after the previous
one.  (For ease of viewing this file on a standard terminal, I'm
clipping the examples at column 80.)

</P>
<P>
This method covers the whole page with lines printed evenly @math{S}
rows apart.  However, we want to fill in all the other rows with
printing to get a full-density page (we're ignoring oversampling at this
stage).  Where we have previously printed a single pass, we'll now print
a "pass block": we print extra passes to fill in the empty rows.  A
naive implementation might look like this:

(Now you can see why this process is called "weaving"!)
