>    One example where this feature might be used is as follows.  The
author frequently prints photos on Epson 4x6 photo paper.  Note that
this paper is physically larger than 4x6 and it has perforations on
all four sides.  The author dislikes printing part of the image on the
perforated parts of the paper which will be removed after
printing the photo.  By selecting the proper scaling percentage,
printing can be constrained to the 4x6 part of the paper which will
remain after the perforated sections are removed.  The author has
saved this setting using this feature of the Gimp-Print software.

to the number of dots that your printer will print in a space of one
inch (approximately 2.54 cm).  This is highly dependent upon the
capability of your printer.  Resolutions below 300 DPI are
used for draft quality.  For general purpose printing, select
300 - 360 DPI.  Higher quality printing can be achieved by
selecting 600 - 720 DPI.  Settings higher than this are used for the
highest possible quality for printing photographs and other high
quality graphics.  Experiment with your printer and these settings
with different types of graphics and photographs to see what
results you can obtain with your printer.  High resolutions (large
numbers of dots per inch) require substantial image processing time,
and the print files can be very large; it's not uncommon for a full
page, 1440x720 DPI image to require 100 MB of temporary storage!

fact that the quality will be relatively low, but suitable for rough
drafts.  Draft quality is higher than fast economy draft.  These
options will give you the fastest printing speed.  Economy Draft uses
less ink, and as a result the image will be pale.  These modes are
generally not very useful for printing photographs.

>         When printing an image, you have probably noticed the print
head inside the printer moving back and forth across the print media.
Many printers are capable of putting ink on the page regardless of
which direction the print head is moving.  However, quality can
sometimes be improved by only putting ink on the page when the printer
head is moving in one direction.  The
<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Unidirectional</SPAN
> setting instructs the
software to only place ink on the page when the print head is moving
one way.  When the print head returns, it will not place ink on the
page.  On many printers, the print quality is better, at the expense
of printing speed.

the printed image looks like it has rows of stripes with a small
separation between the stripes.  This effect is called "banding" and
is undesirable.  In the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>high</I
> and
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>highest</I
> quality modes, the printer will make more
passes over the same part of the page in order to improve quality and
(reduce or) eliminate banding.  This requires more temporary disk
space and prints more slowly, but does not require significantly more
processing time.

       special software within the printer to improve the print quality.
       Microweave print modes will usually produce better quality
       output than non-Microweave modes, with only a small performance
       penalty.  If Microweave is not listed at your chosen

set to 50, the image will be scaled to 50% of the size of the print
medium.  When set to 100, the image will attempt to fill the print

    </P
><P
> The <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"

ordered dither.  On simple four color printers (or other printers used
in four color mode), the quality is similar to
<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Ordered</SPAN
>, although dark gray rendition is
not as good due to a simpler transfer between black and colored ink.
With six-color printers, color rendition is somewhat worse, but it
should be quite usable in cases where optimum quality is not critical.
In black and white, it is an efficient way to render grayscale, but it
may not give best results when used with variable dot size printers
(modern Epson printers, or Canon printers using DMT).  On rare three
color printers (CMY only) the results should be identical to ordered
dither.

<SPAN

screening, although it isn't.  On laser printers, and possibly on
certain kinds of text and line art, <SPAN

>Very
Fast</SPAN

    </P
><P
>Error diffusion algorithms (<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Hybrid
Floyd-Steinberg</SPAN

at high densities, and are capable of
rendering very fine detail rather well, but they tend to exhibit artifacts in
the form of "waves" or "worms" of dots which results in noticeable
texturing in pale areas.  Furthermore, pale areas immediately adjacent
to white take a while to "build up" sufficient error to print at all.
This is sometimes called "tearing" or "waterfalling".
