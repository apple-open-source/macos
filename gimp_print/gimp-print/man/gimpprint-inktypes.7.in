.TH GIMPPRINT-INKTYPES 7 "@RELEASE_DATE@" "Version @GIMPPRINT_VERSION@" "Gimp-Print Manual Pages"
.SH NAME
gimpprint-inktypes \- Gimp-Print inkset types
.SH DESCRIPTION
Gimp-Print supports many different inksets, which are printer type specific.
The option names are case sensitive.  Two names are listed for each resolution;
the first (short) name is the \fIinktype\fP, and the second (long) name is
descriptive.  Not all ink types are supported on all printers.
.SH INK TYPES
.SS Epson and Lexmark (other than the 4076) printers
Six color printers can print using four color inks or all six colors.  Six
color mode is recommended for photographs.  Four color mode may be useful when
printing text with embedded graphics to reduce ink consumption, or to print
higher quality with Ordered, Fast, or Very Fast dithering (see below).
.PP
The "Composite" modes use only color inks (no black) to produce all colors and
black.  These ink types are rarely useful, but on certain types of paper they
may produce a smoother image than that produced by mixing black ink in.  The
Epson Stylus Color 1500 cannot mix black ink with colored inks; on this
printer, Three Color Composite must be used.
