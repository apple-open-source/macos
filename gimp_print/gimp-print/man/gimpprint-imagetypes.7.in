.TH GIMPPRINT-IMAGETYPES 7 "@RELEASE_DATE@" "Version @GIMPPRINT_VERSION@" "Gimp-Print Manual Pages"
.SH NAME
gimpprint-imagetypes \- Gimp-Print image types
.SH DESCRIPTION

the dither, depending on the type of image you wish to print.
.SH IMAGE TYPE
Possible values are:
.PP
.TS
li li
lb lw(4i).
Value	Description
_
1	T{
.na

T}

3	T{

T}
.TE
.PP
Option \fI0\fP is the fastest.  It generates strong, but not particularly
accurate, colors.  There may be some fairly sharp color transitions in this
mode.
.PP
Option \fI1\fP generates more accurate colors, but is slower.
.PP
Option \fI2\fP generates the most accurate colors, but is considerably slower.
.PP
Note that any of the modes may be used with either color or black & white
output.  If black and white output is requested, but a color mode used,
composite color will be printed.  This generally offers smoother tone, but less
purity of gray or black, than pure black ink.  Furthermore, it is possible to
tune the color of the gray (to achieve warmer or cooler effects) using the
color controls in this fashion.
