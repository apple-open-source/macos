<H1>Cyrus SASL for System Administrators</H1>

This document covers configuring SASL for system administrators,
specifically those administrators who are installing a server that
uses the Cyrus SASL library.

<h2><A NAME="saslintro">What SASL is</A></h2>

SASL, the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, is a generic
mechanism for protocols to accomplish authentication.  Since protocols
(such as SMTP or IMAP) use SASL, it is a natural place for code
sharing between applications.  Some notable applications that use the
Cyrus SASL library include <a
href="http://www.sendmail.org">Sendmail</a> (versions 8.10.0 and
higher) and <a href="http://web.asg.cmu.edu/cyrus">Cyrus imapd</a>
(versions 1.6.0 and higher).

<p> Applications use the SASL library to tell them how to accomplish
the SASL protocol exchange, and what the results were.

<p> SASL is only a framework: specific SASL mechanisms govern the
exact protocol exchange.  If there are n protocols and m different
ways of authenticating, SASL attempts to make it so only n plus m
different specifications need be written instead of n times m
different specifications.  With the Cyrus SASL library, the mechanisms
need only be written once, and they'll work with all servers that use
it.

<h3><a name="authid">Authentication and authorization identifiers</a></h3>

An important concept to become familiar with is the difference between
an "authorization identifier" and an "authentication identifier".

<DL compact>
<DT>userid (user id, authorization id)<dd> The userid is the
identifier an application uses to check allowable options.  On my Unix
system, the user "<tt>bovik</tt>" (the account of Harry Q. Bovik) is
allowed to write to "<tt>/home/bovik</tt>" and it's subdirectories but
not to "<tt>/etc</tt>".

<DT>authid (authentication id)<dd> The authentication identifier is
the identifier that is being checked.  "bovik"'s password might be
"qqqq", and the system will authenticate anyone who knows "qqqq" as
"bovik".  However, it's possible to authenticate as one user but
<b>act as</b> another user.  For instance, Harry might be away on
vacation and assign one of his graduate students, Jane, to read his
mail.  He might then allow Jane to act as him merely by supplying her
password and her id as authentication but requesting authorization as
"bovik". So Jane might log in with an authentication identifier of
"jane" and an authorization id of "bovik" and her own (Jane's)
password.
</DL>

<p>Applications can set their own proxy policies; by default, the SASL
library will only allow the same user to act for another (that is,
userid must equal authid).

<h3><a name="realms">Realms</a></h3>

The Cyrus SASL library supports the concept of "realms".  A realm is
an abstract set of users and certain mechanisms authenticate users in
a certain realm.

<p>In the simplest case, a single server on a single machine, the
realm might be the fully-qualified domain name of the server.  If the
applications don't specify a realm to SASL, most mechanisms will
default to this.

<p> If a site wishes to share passwords between multiple machines, it
might choose it's authentication realm as a domain name, such as
"CMU.EDU".  On the other hand, in order to prevent the entire site's
security from being compromised when one machine is compromised, each
server could have it's own realm. Certain mechanisms force the user
(client side) to manually configure what realm they're in, making it
harder for users to authenticate.

<p>A single site might support multiple different realms.  This can
confuse applications that weren't written in anticipation of this;
make sure your application can support it before adding users from
different realms into sasldb with <tt>saslpasswd</tt>.

<p>The Kerberos mechanisms treat the SASL realm as the Kerberos
realm.  Thus, the realm for Kerberos mechanisms defaults to the
default Kerberos realm on the server.  They may support cross-realm
authentication; check your application on how it deals with this.

<h2><a name="saslhow">How SASL works</a></h2>

How SASL works is governed by what mechanism the client and server 
choose to use and the exact implementation of that mechanism.  This
section describes the way these mechanisms act in the Cyrus SASL
implementation.

<h3>The PLAIN mechanism, <tt>sasl_checkpass()</tt>, and plaintext
passwords</h3>

The PLAIN mechanism is not a secure method of authentication by
itself.  It is intended for connections that are being encrypted by
another level.  (For example, the IMAP command "STARTTLS" creates an
encrypted connection over which PLAIN might be used.) The PLAIN
mechanism works by transmitting a userid, an authentication id, and a
password to the server, and the server then determines whether that is
an allowable triple.

<p>The principal concern for system administrators is how the
authentication and password are verified.  The Cyrus SASL library is
flexible in this regard:

<DL>
<dt><i>sasldb</i><dd> This stores passwords in the SASL secrets
  database, the same database that stores the secrets for shared
  secret methods.  Its principal advantages are that passwords used by
  the shared secrets mechanisms will be in sync with the plaintext
  password mechanisms and that this is the only plaintext
  authentication method that supports multiple realms on a single
  server.  However, system built-in routines will not use sasldb.
  <p>(<tt>sasldb</tt> is the default method.)<p>

<dt><i>pwcheck</i><dd> checks passwords with the use of a separate,
  helper daemon. <b>needs to be documented.</b><p>

<dt><i>saslauthd</i><dd> contacts the saslauthd daemon to to check
  passwords using a variety of mechanisms.  You can compile support
  for saslauthd using the --with-saslauthd configure option.  More
  information can be found in saslauthd(8).  Once you configure
  saslauthd, there is a testsaslauthd program that can be built
  with <tt>make testsaslauthd</tt> in the saslauthd directory, that
  can check to ensure that the saslauthd daemon is installed and
  running properly.<p> 

<dt><i>write your own</i><dd> Last, but not least, the most flexible
  method of authentication for PLAIN is to write your own.  If you do
  so, any application that calls the "<tt>sasl_checkpass()</tt>"
  routine or uses PLAIN will invoke your code.  The easiest place to
  modify the plaintext authentication routines is to modify the
  routine "<tt>_sasl_checkpass()</tt>" in the file
  <tt>lib/server.c</tt> to support a new method, and to add that
  method to <tt>lib/checkpw.c</tt>.  Be sure to add a prototype in
  <tt>lib/saslint.h</tt>!<p>
  It is important to note however that
  currently the more flexible/preferred method is to create a new saslauthd
  mechanism.<p>
</dl>

<p>The LOGIN mechanism (not to be confused with IMAP4's LOGIN command)
is an undocumented, unsupported mechanism.  It's included in the Cyrus
SASL distribution for the sake of SMTP servers that might want to
interoperate with old clients.  Do not enable this mechanism unless
you know you're going to need it.  When enabled, it verifies passwords
the same way the PLAIN mechanism does.

<h3>Shared secrets mechanisms</h3>

The Cyrus SASL library also supports some "shared secret"
authentication methods: CRAM-MD5 and its successor DIGEST-MD5.  These
methods rely on the client and the server sharing a "secret", usually
a password.  The server generates a challenge and the client a
response proving that it knows the shared secret.  This is much more
secure than simply sending the secret over the wire proving that the
client knows it.

<p>There's a downside: in order to verify such responses, the
server must keep passwords or password equivalents in a database;
if this database is compromised, it is the same as if all the
passwords for the realm are compromised.

<p>For simplicity sake, the Cyrus SASL library stores plaintext
passwords only in the <tt>/etc/sasldb2</tt> database.  These passwords
are then shared among all mechanisms which choose to use it.
Depending on the exact database method
used (gdbm, ndbm, or db) the file may have different suffixes or may
even have two different files ("<tt>sasldb.dir</tt>" and
"<tt>sasldb.pag</tt>").  It is also possible for a server to define
it's own way of storing authentication secrets.  Currently, no
application is known to do this.

<p>The principle problem for a system administrator is to make sure that
sasldb is properly protected; only the servers that need to read it to
verify passwords should be able to.  If there are any normal shell
users on the system, they must not be able to read it.

<p>This point is important, so we will repeat it: <b>sasldb stores the
plaintext versions of all of its passwords, if it is compromised so
are all of the passwords that it stores</b>.

<p>Managing password changes is outside the scope of the library.
However, system administrators should probably make a way of letting
user's change their passwords available to users.  The
"<tt>saslpasswd</tt>" utility is provided to change the secrets in
sasldb.  It does not affect PAM, <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>, or any other
standard system library; it only affects secrets stored in sasldb.

<p>Finally, system administrators should think if they want to enable
"auto_transition".  If set, the library will automatically create
secrets in sasldb when a user uses PLAIN to successfully authenticate.
However, this means that the individual servers, such as imapd, need
read/write access to sasldb, not just read access.  By default,
"auto_transition" is set to false; set it to true to enable.  (There's
no point in enabling this option if "pwcheck_method" is "sasldb".)

<h3>Kerberos mechanisms</h3>

The Cyrus SASL library also comes with two mechanisms that make use of
Kerberos: KERBEROS_V4, which should be able to use any Kerberos v4
implementation, and GSSAPI (tested against MIT Kerberos 5 and Heimdal
Kerberos 5).  These mechanisms make use of the kerberos infrastructure
and thus have no password database.

<p>Applications that wish to use a kerberos mechanism will need access
to a service key, stored either in a "srvtab" file (Kerberos 4) or a
"keytab" file (Kerberos 5).  Currently, the keytab file location is
not configurable and defaults to the system default (probably
<tt>/etc/krb5.keytab</tt>).

<p>The Kerberos 4 srvtab file location is configurable; by default it is
<tt>/etc/srvtab</tt>, but this is modifiable by the "srvtab" option.
Different SASL applications can use different srvtab files.

<p>A SASL application must be able to read its srvtab or keytab file.

<p>You may want to consult the <a href="gssapi.html">GSSAPI Tutorial</a>.</p>

<h3>The OTP mechanism</h3>

The Cyrus SASL library also supports the One-Time-Password (OTP)
mechanism.  This mechanism is similar to CRAM-MD5 and DIGEST-MD5 in
that is uses a shared secret and a challenge/response exchange.
However, OTP is more secure than the other shared secret mechanisms in
that the secret is used to generate a sequence of one-time (single
use) passwords which prevents reply attacks, and that secret need
not be stored on the system.  These one-time passwords are stored in the
<tt>/etc/sasldb2</tt> database.  See the <i>Shared secrets
mechanisms</i> section for a discussion of the <tt>/etc/sasldb2</tt>
database.

<h4>OTP via OPIE</h4>
For sites with an existing OTP infrastructure using OPIE, Cyrus SASL
can be configured to use OPIE v2.4 instead of using its own database
and server-side routines.
OPIE should be configured with the <tt>--disable-user-locking</tt> 
option if the SASL server application will not be running as "root". 

<p>OPIE uses its own "opiekeys" database for storing the data necessary
for generating the server challenges.  The location of the opiekeys
file is configurable in SASL; by default it is <tt>/etc/opiekeys</tt>,
but this is modifiable by the "opiekeys" option.

<p>A SASL server application must be able to read and write the
opiekeys file.

<h2>How to set configuration options</h2>

The Cyrus SASL library comes with a built-in configuration file
reader.  However, it is also possible for applications to redefine
where the library gets it's configuration options from.

<h3><a name="saslconf">The default configuration file</a></h3>

<p>By default, the Cyrus SASL library reads it's options from
<tt>/usr/lib/sasl/App.conf</tt> (where "App" is the application
defined name of the application).  For instance, Sendmail reads it's
configuration from "<tt>/usr/lib/sasl/Sendmail.conf</tt>" and the
sample server application included with the library looks in
"<tt>/usr/lib/sasl/sample.conf</tt>".

<p>A standard Cyrus SASL configuration file looks like: 
<pre>
srvtab: /var/app/srvtab
pwcheck_method: kerberos_v4
</pre>

<h3>Application configuration</h3>

Applications can redefine how the SASL library looks for configuration
information.  Check your application's documentation for specifics.

<p>For instance, Cyrus imapd reads its sasl options from it's own
configuration file, <tt>/etc/imapd.conf</tt>, by prepending all SASL
options with "<tt>sasl_</tt>": the SASL option "pwcheck_method" is set
by changing "sasl_pwcheck_method" in <tt>/etc/imapd.conf</tt>.

Check your application's documentation for more information.

<h2>Compiling and installing the library</h2>

<h3>what configure options to use?</h3>

<p><b>don't install a mechanism you aren't going to use.</b></p>

<p>use <tt>--disable-krb4</tt> and <tt>--disable-gssapi</tt> if you
aren't a kerberos site.</p>

<p>use <tt>--disable-cram</tt> and <tt>--disable-digest</tt> if you
can't use shared secret mechanisms.</p>

<p>need pwcheck?  use <tt>--enable-pwcheck</tt>

<h3>other stuff</h3>

<p>what can go wrong with shared libraries?

<p>make sure to make the /usr/lib/sasl symbolic link.

<p>canon_user plugin selection: uses canon_user_plugin option

<p>Unfortunately, since SASL is very flexible (allowing administrators to
upgrade and install new authentication plugins without recompiling any
applications) its flexibility can also make it a chore to compile.

<p>I'll have some sage advice here when I find some.

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<dl compact>
<dt><b>Q:</b> Why doesn't KERBEROS_V4 doesn't appear as an
available mechanism?
<dd>
<p><b>A:</b> Check that the <tt>srvtab</tt> file is readable by the
user running as the daemon.  For Cyrus imapd, it must be readable by
the Cyrus user.  By default, the library looks for the srvtab in
<tt>/etc/srvtab</tt>, but it's configurable using the <tt>srvtab</tt>
option.

<p>
<dt><b>Q:</b> Why doesn't OTP doesn't appear as an available
mechanism?
<dd>
<p><b>A:</b> If using OPIE, check that the <tt>opiekeys</tt> file is
readable by the user running the daemon.  For Cyrus imapd, it must
be readable by the Cyrus user.  By default, the library looks for the
opiekeys in <tt>/etc/opiekeys</tt>, but it's configurable using the
<tt>opiekeys</tt> option.

<p>
<dt><b>Q:</b> Why don't CRAM-MD5 and DIGEST-MD5 work with my old sasldb?
<dd>
<p><b>A:</b> Because sasldb now stores plaintext passwords only, the old
sasldb is completely incompatible.

<p>
<dt><b>Q:</b> Is LOGIN supported?
<dd>
<p><b>A:</b> The LOGIN mechanism is a non-standard, undocumented
plaintext mechanism.  It's included in the SASL distribution purely
for sites that need it to interoperate with old clients; we don't
support it.  Don't enable it unless you know you need it.

<p>
<dt><b>Q:</b> How can I get a non-root application to check plaintext
passwords?
<dd>
<p><b>A:</b> Try using the "pwcheck" daemon and setting "pwcheck_method"
to "pwcheck".  Alternatively, you can use the saslauthd daemon.
You'll have to run <tt>configure</tt> with the <tt>--with-pwcheck</tt> or
<tt>--with-saslauthd</tt> option respectively.

<p>
<dt><b>Q:</b> I want to use Berkeley DB, but it's installed in
<tt>/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.3.1</tt> and <tt>configure</tt> can't find
it.
<dd>
<p><b>A:</b> Try setting "CPPFLAGS" and "LDFLAGS" environment
variables before running <tt>configure</tt>, like so:
<pre>
env CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.3.1/include" \
  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.3.1/lib -R/usr/local/BerkeleyDB.3.1/lib" \
  ./configure --with-dblib=berkeley 
</pre>

<p>
<dt><b>Q:</b> Is there a mailing list to discuss the Cyrus SASL
library?
<dd>
<p><b>A:</b> <tt>cyrus-sasl@lists.andrew.cmu.edu</tt> is available for
