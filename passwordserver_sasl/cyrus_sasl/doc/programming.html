    <a name="intro"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
    
    <a name="about_this_guide"><h3>About this Guide</h3></a>

    <p>This guide gives a tutorial on the use of the Cyrus SASL library
    for a client or server application. It complies with versions including
    and after 2.0.0. The following pages should only be
    considered a guide, not the final word on programming with the
    Cyrus SASL library. Consult the header files in the distribution in
    the case of ambiguities.

    <a name="what_is_sasl"><h3>What is SASL?</h3></a>

    <p>SASL stands for Simple Authentication Security Layer and is
    explained in <a href="http://ftp.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2222.txt">RFC
    2222</a>. That document is very difficult to understand however
    and it should be unnecessary to consult it.

    <a name="background"><h2>Background</h2></a>

    <a name="world_before"><h3>How did the world work before SASL?</h3></a>

    <p>Before SASL, when a new protocol was written which required
    authentication (users proving who they are to an entity), the
    protocol had to allow explicitly for each individual
    authentication mechanism. There had to be a distinct way to say "I
    want to log in with Kerberos V4". There had to be another distinct
    way to say "I want to log in with CRAM-MD5". There had to be yet a
    different way to say "I want to log in anonymously," and so
    on. This was non-ideal for both the protocol and application
    writers.

    <p>Additionally, many programmers were not very familiar with
    security, so the protocol did support many mechanisms, or worse,
    they were supported incorrectly. Moreover, when a new
    authentication method was invented the protocol needed to be
    modified to support that mechanism.

    <p>This system also was not ideal for application writer. She had
    to have a special case for each mechanism she wished her
    application to support. Also, the mechanisms were difficult to
    implement. Even with a good library, an understanding of how the
    mechanism worked was still necessary. Finally if an application
    used more than one protocol (for example a mail client might use
    IMAP, POP, and SMTP) then "Kerberos V4 for IMAP", "Kerberos V4 for
    POP", "Kerberos V4 for SMTP", "CRAM MD5 for IMAP", "CRAM-MD5 for
    POP", etc... would need to be written. This could quickly create a
    huge number of different mechanism-protocol pairs to implement.

    <a name="sasl_rescue"><h3>SASL to the rescue!</h3></a>

    <p>SASL hopefully solves all these problems. In practice it makes
    many of them easier to deal with.

    <p>Protocol designers simply have to support SASL (in particular
    RFC 2222). Consequently, any mechanism that supports SASL (just
    about anything you would want to use does now) is supported by the
    protocol. If a new authentication mechanism is invented the
    protocol automatically supports it without any modifications.

    <p>Application writers, instead of having to support every mechanism
    for every protocol, only need to support SASL for every
    protocol. Application writers do not need to understand the
    authentication mechanisms at all: the SASL library handles all
    that. Also with the Cyrus SASL library if a new mechanism is
    invented you do not have rewrite your application at all. You may
    not even have to restart your application if it is a long running
    process. This is because the Cyrus SASL library loads each mechanism
    from a shared library. Simply copying a shared library into a
    directory will magically make your application support a new
    mechanism.

    <p>Cyrus SASL version 2 supports a much improved API over version 1,
    that allows for much smarter and faster memory allocation for the
    mechanisms as well as the applications.  It is also provides for
    several new types of plugins to allow for greater overall flexibility.
    Unfortunately, though similar, this new API is completely incompatible
    with the old API, and applications will need to be rewritten.

    <a name="briefly"><h2>Briefly</h2></a>

    <a name="what_good_for"><h3>What is the Cyrus SASL library good for?</h3></a>

    <p>The Cyrus SASL library is good for applications that wish to
    use protocols that support SASL authentication. An non-exhaustive
    list of these are: IMAP, SMTP, ACAP, and LDAP. Also if you are
    making a proprietary system and wish to support authentication it
    is a good way of supporting many different authentication types.

    <a name="what_do"><h3>What does the Cyrus SASL library do?</h3></a>

    <p>From a client point of view, the Cyrus SASL library, given a list of
    mechanisms the server supports it will decide the best mechanism
    to use and tell you what to send to the server at each step of the
    authentication. From a server perspective, it handles
    authentication requests from clients.

    <a name="what_doesnt"><h3>What doesn't the Cyrus SASL library do?</h3></a>
    
   <p>The Cyrus SASL library is neither network nor protocol aware. It
   is up to the application to send the data over the wire as well as
   to send the data in the protocol specific manner. With IMAP this
   means putting it in the form: <tt>+ [base64'ed data]\r\n</tt>. LDAP
   just sends data in binary via bind requests. The Cyrus SASL library
   has utility base64 encode and decode routines to help with this.
    
<a name="client_section"><h2>Client-only Section</h2></a>
    
    <a name="client_typical"><h3>A typical interaction from the client's perspective</h3></a>
    
    <ol>
    <li>A client makes a few calls (explained later) to initialize SASL. 
    <li>Every time the client application makes a new connection it should make a new context that is kept for the life of the connection.
    <li>Ask the server for the list of supported mechanisms
    <li>Feed this list to the library
    <li>Start the authentication with the mechanism the library chose
    
    <li>The server will return some bytes
    <li>Give these to the library
    <li>The library returns some bytes to the application
    <li>Application sends these bytes over the network
	
    <li>repeat the last 4 steps until the server tells you that the authentication is completed
    </ol>

    <a name="client_code"><h3>How does this look in code</h3></a>

    <b>Initialize the library</b>. (done once).

    <tt><pre>    
	    int result;

	    /* attempt to start sasl 
	     * See the section on Callbacks and Interactions for an 
	     * explanation of the variable callbacks

	    result=sasl_client_init(callbacks);
            
            /* check to see if that worked */
            if (result!=SASL_OK) [failure]
     </pre></tt>

     <b>For every network connection, make a new SASL connection</b>:

     <tt><pre>

			           NULL, NULL, /* Local and remote IP
                                                  address strings

                                                   which require this info)*/

            /* check to see if that worked */
            if (result!=SASL_OK) [failure]

      </pre></tt>

       Next get the list of SASL mechanisms the server supports. This
       is usually done through a capability command. Format the list
       as a single string separated by spaces.
       
       Feed this string into SASL to begin the authentication process.

       <tt><pre>
       
            sasl_interact_t *client_interact=NULL;
            const char *out, *mechusing;
            unsigned outlen;

            do {

              result=sasl_client_start(conn,      /* the same context from
                                                     above */ 
                                       mechlist,  /* the list of mechanisms
                                                     from the server */
                                       &client_interact, /* filled in if an
                                                            interaction is needed */
			  	       &out,      /* filled in on success */
                                       &outlen,   /* filled in on success */
				       &mechusing);

              if (result==SASL_INTERACT)
              {
                 [deal with the interactions. See interactions section below]
              }


           } while (result==SASL_INTERACT); /* the mechanism may ask us to fill
                                               in things many times. result is 
                                               SASL_CONTINUE on success */
           if (result!=SASL_CONTINUE) [failure]

        </pre></tt>

        Note that you do not need to worry about the allocation and freeing
        of the output buffer out.  This is all handled inside of the mechanism.
        It is important to note, however, that the output buffer is not valid
        after the next call to <tt>sasl_client_start</tt> or
        <tt>sasl_client_step</tt>.<p>

        If this is successful send the protocol specific command to
        start the authentication process. This may or may not allow
        for initial data to be sent (see the documentation of the
        protocol to see).

        <pre>
        For IMAP this might look like:
          {tag} "AUTHENTICATE" {mechusing}\r\n
          A01 AUTHENTICATE KERBEROS_V4\r\n
           
        SMTP looks like:
         "AUTH" {mechusing}[ {out base64 encoded}]
         AUTH DIGEST-MD5 GHGJJGDDFDKHGHJG=
        </pre>
       
	<br>	      
        <a name="client_authentication_step"><b>Check Results</b></a>
        <br>

        Next, read what the server sent back. It can be one of three things:
        <ol>
	  <li>Authentication failure. Authentication process is
	  halted. This might look like <tt>A01 NO Authentication
	  failure</tt> in IMAP or <tt>501 Failed</tt> in SMTP. Either
	  retry the authentication or abort.

	  <li>Authentication success. We're now successfully
	  authenticated. This might look like <tt>A01 OK Authenticated
	  successful</tt> in IMAP or <tt>235 Authentication
	  successful</tt> in SMTP. Go <a
	  href="#client_authentication_success">here</a>

	  <li>Another step in the authentication process is
	  necessary. This might look like <tt>+ HGHDS1HAFJ=</tt> in
	  IMAP or <tt>334
	  PENCeUxFREJoU0NnbmhNWitOMjNGNndAZWx3b29kLmlubm9zb2Z0LmNvbT4=</tt>
	  in SMTP. Note it could be an empty string such as <tt>+
	  \r\n</tt> in IMAP.

        </ol>

        Convert the continuation data to binary format
        (for example, this may include base64 decoding it).

        Perform another step in the authentication.

        <tt><pre>

              do {
                result=sasl_client_step(conn,  /* our context */
				        in,    /* the data from the server */
				        inlen, /* it's length */
				        &client_interact,  /* this should be
                                                              unallocated and NULL */
				        &out,     /* filled in on success */
				        &outlen); /* filled in on success */

                if (result==SASL_INTERACT)
                {
                   [deal with the interactions. See below]
                }


              } while (result==SASL_INTERACT || result == SASL_CONTINUE);

              if (result!=SASL_OK) [failure]
              
          </pre></tt>

          Format the output (variable out of length outlen) in the
          protocol specific manner and send it across the network to
          the server.

          <br>

          Goto <a href="#client_authentication_step">here</a> (this process
          repeats until authentication either succeeds or fails.
         
          <br><br><br>

          <a name="client_authentication_success"><b>Authentication Successful</b></a><br><br>

          <p>Before we're done we need to call sasl_client_step() one
          more time to make sure the server isn't trying to fool
          us. Some protocols include data along with the last step. If
          so this data should be used here. If not use a length of
          zero.

	    <tt><pre>

                result=sasl_client_step(conn,  /* our context */
				        in,    /* the data from the server */
				        inlen, /* it's length */
				        &client_interact,  /* this should be unallocated and NULL */
				        &out,     /* filled in on success */
				        &outlen); /* filled in on success */

                if (result!=SASL_OK) [failure]
	    </pre></tt>
		     
          <p>Congratulations. You have successfully authenticated to
          the server.</p>

          <p>Don't throw away the SASL connection object (sasl_conn_t *)
          yet though. If a security layer was negotiated you will need
          it to encode and decode the data sent over the network.</p>

          <br>
 
          When you are finally done with connection to server,
          dispose of SASL connection.

          <tt><pre>
	  
               sasl_dispose(&conn);

          </pre></tt>

	  If you are done with SASL forever (application quiting for example):
 
          <tt><pre>
            sasl_done();         
	  </pre></tt>
	    

    <h3>sasl_client_init</h3>
    <pre>
    int sasl_client_init(const sasl_callback_t *callbacks);
    </pre>
    
    <ul>Parameters:
      <li>callbacks - List of callbacks. See Callbacks section
    </ul>

    This function initializes the SASL library. This must be called
    before any other SASL calls. See the callbacks section for
    complete description of callbacks.
        
    <h3>sasl_client_new</h3>

    <pre>
    int sasl_client_new(const char *service,
		        const char *serverFQDN,
                        const char *iplocalport,
                        const char *ipremoteport,
		        const sasl_callback_t *prompt_supp,
		        unsigned secflags,
		        sasl_conn_t **pconn);
    </pre>
    
    <ul>Parameters:
      <li>service - the service name being used. This usually is the protocol name (e.g. "ldap")
      <li>serverFQDN - Fully qualified domain name of server
      <li>iplocalport and ipremoteport - a string of the format
	  &quot;a.b.c.d;p&quot; detailing the local or remote IP and port,
          or NULL (which will disable mechanisms that require
          this information)
      <li>prompt_supp - List off callbacks specific to this connection
      <li>secflags - security flags ORed together requested (e.g. SASL_SEC_NOPLAINTEXT)
      <li>pconn - the SASL connection object allocated upon success
    </ul>

    This function creates a new SASL connection object. It should be
    called once for every connection you want to authenticate for.

    <h3>sasl_client_start</h3>

    <pre>
    int sasl_client_start(sasl_conn_t *conn,
		          const char *mechlist,
			  sasl_interact_t **prompt_need,
			  const char **clientout,
			  unsigned *clientoutlen,
			  const char **mech);
    </pre>
    
    <ul>Parameters:
      <li>conn - the SASL connection object gotten from sasl_client_new()
      <li>mechlist - the list of mechanisms to try (separated by spaces)
      <li>prompt_need - filled in when a SASL_INTERACT is returned
      <li>clientout - filled in upon success with data to send to server
      <li>clientoutlen - length of that data
      <li>mech - filled in with mechanism being used
    </ul>

    This function starts an authentication session. It takes a list of
    possible mechanisms (usually gotten from the server through a
    capability command) and chooses the "best" mechanism to try. Upon
    success clientout points at data to send to the server.

    <h3>sasl_client_step</h3>

    <pre>
    int sasl_client_step(sasl_conn_t *conn,
		 const char *serverin,
		 unsigned serverinlen,
		 sasl_interact_t **prompt_need,
		 const char **clientout,
		 unsigned *clientoutlen);
    </pre>
    
    <ul>Parameters:
      <li>conn - the SASL connection object gotten from sasl_client_new()
      <li>serverin - data from the server
      <li>serverinlen - length of data from the server
      <li>prompt_need - filled in with a SASL_INTERACT is returned
      <li>clientout - filled in upon success with data to send to server
      <li>clientoutlen - length of that data
    </ul>

    This step preforms a step in the authentication process. It takes
    the data from the server (serverin) and outputs data to send to
    the server (clientout) upon success. SASL_CONTINUE is returned if
    another step in the authentication process is necessary. SASL_OK
    is returned if we're all done.

    The server makes a few Cyrus SASL calls for initialization. When
    it gets a new connection it should make a new context for that
    connection immediately. The client may then request a list of
    mechanisms the server supports. The client also may request to
    authenticate at some point. The client will specify the mechanism
    it wishes to use. The server should negotiate this authentication
    and keep around the context afterwards for encoding and decoding
    the layers.
    
    <a name="server_code"><h3>How does this look in code?</h3></a>

    Initialization (done once). The application name is used for
    reading configuration information.

    <tt><pre>    
    int result;

    /* Initialize SASL */
    result=sasl_server_init(callbacks,      /* Callbacks supported */
                            "TestServer");  /* Name of the application */

    </pre></tt>

    This should be called for each new connection. It probably should
    be called right when the socket is accepted.

    <pre><tt>
    sasl_conn_t *conn;
    int result;

    /* Make a new context for this connection */

			            lookups; NULL means default to serverFQDN
                                    Note: This does not affect Kerberos */

                               * using security properties, separately)
			   &conn);

    </pre></tt>


    When a client requests the list of mechanisms supported by the server. This particular call might produce the string: <i>"{PLAIN, KERBEROS_V4, CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5}"</i>

    <pre><tt>
    result=sasl_listmech(conn,  /* The context for this connection */
			 NULL,  /* not supported */

			 ", ",  /* What to separate mechanisms with */

                         &string_length, /* length of the string */
                         &number_of_mechanisms); /* Number of mechanisms in
	                                            the string */
	
    </pre></tt>

    When a client requests to authenticate:

    <tt><pre>
    int result;
    const char *out;
    unsigned outlen;

    result=sasl_server_start(conn, /* context */
                             mechanism_client_chose,
                             clientin,    /* the optional string the client gave us */
                             clientinlen, /* and it's length */
                             &out, /* The output of the library.
                                      Might not be NULL terminated */
                             &outlen);

    if ((result!=SASL_OK) && (result!=SASL_CONTINUE))
      [failure. Send protocol specific message that says authentication failed]
    else if (result==SASL_OK)
      [authentication succeeded. Send client the protocol specific message 
       to say that authentication is complete]
    else 
      [send data 'out' with length 'outlen' over the network in protocol
       specific format]
    </pre></tt>

    When a response is returned by the client. <i>clientin</i> is the
    data from the client decoded from protocol specific format to a
    string of bytes of length <i>clientinlen</i>. This step may occur
    zero or more times. An application must be able to deal with it
    occurring an arbitrary number of times.

    <tt><pre>
    int result;
   
    result=sasl_server_step(conn,
                            clientin,      /* what the client gave */
                            clientinlen,   /* it's length */
                            &out,          /* allocated by library on success. 
                                              Might not be NULL terminated */
                            &outlen);

    if ((result!=SASL_OK) && (result!=SASL_CONTINUE))
      [failure. Send protocol specific message that says authentication failed]
    else if (result==SASL_OK)
      [authentication succeeded. Send client the protocol specific message 
       to say that authentication is complete]
    else 
      [send data 'out' with length 'outlen' over the network in protocol
       specific format]
    </pre></tt>

    This continues until authentication succeeds.  When the connection is
    concluded, make a call to <tt>sasl_dispose</tt> as with the client
    connection.

    <a name="sasl_server_init"><h3>sasl_server_init</h3></a>

    int sasl_server_init(const sasl_callback_t *callbacks,
                         const char *appname);

    <ul>Parameters:

    <li>callbacks - A list of callbacks supported by the application
    (see Interaction and Callbacks section)

    <li>appname - A string of the name of the application. This string
    is what is used when loading configuration options.
    
    </ul>
	
    sasl_server_init() initializes the session. This should be the
    first function called. In this function the shared library
    authentication mechanisms are loaded.
    
    <a name="sasl_server_new"><h3>sasl_server_new</h3></a>

    int sasl_server_new(const char *service,

                        const char *ipremoteport,
			const sasl_callback_t *callbacks,
			unsigned secflags,
			sasl_conn_t **pconn);

    <ul>Parameters:
    
    <li>service - The name of the service you are supporting. This
    might be "acap" or "smtp". This is used by Kerberos mechanisms and
    possibly other mechanisms. It is also used for PAM authentication.
    
    <li>serverFQDN - This is the fully qualified domain name of the
    server (i.e. your hostname); if NULL, the library calls
    <tt>gethostbyname()</tt>.

    <li>user_realm - The realm the connected client is in.  The
    Kerberos mechanisms ignore this parameter and default to the local
    Kerberos realm.  A value of NULL makes the library default,
    usually to the serverFQDN; a value of "" specifies that the client
    should specify the realm; this also changes the semantics of "@"
    in a username for mechanisms that don't support realms.
	
    <li>iplocalport and ipremoteport - a string of the format
	&quot;a.b.c.d;p&quot; detailing the local or remote IP and port,
	or NULL (which will disable mechanisms that require
	this information)

    <li>callbacks - Additional callbacks that you wish only to apply
    to this connection.

    <li>secflags - security flags.

    <li>pconn - Context. Filled in on success.

    </pre>
    
    <ul>Parameters:
      <li>conn - The context for the connection

      <li>mech - The authentication mechanism the client wishes to try
      (e.g. <tt>KERBEROS_V4</tt>)

      <li>clientin - Initial client challenge bytes. Note: some
      protocols do not allow this.  If this is the case passing NULL
      is valid

      <li>clientinlen - The length of the challenge. 0 is there is none.

      <li>serverout - allocated and filled in by the function. These
      are the bytes that should be encoded as per the protocol and
      sent over the network back to the client.

      <li>serveroutlen - length of bytes to send to client
    </ul>

    This function begins the authentication process with a client. If
    the program returns SASL_CONTINUE that means <tt>serverout</tt>
    should be sent to the client. If SASL_OK is returned that means
    authentication is complete and the application should tell the
    client the authentication was successful. Any other return code
    means the authentication failed and the client should be notified
    of this.

    <a name="sasl_server_step"><h3>sasl_server_step</h3></a>

		         unsigned *serveroutlen);
    </pre>

    <ul>Parameters:
      <li>conn - The context for the connection

      <li>clientin - Data sent by the client.

      <li>clientinlen - The length of the client data. Note that this may be 0

      <li>serverout - allocated and filled in by the function. These
      are the bytes that should be encoded as per the protocol and
      sent over the network back to the client.

      <li>serveroutlen - length of bytes to send to client. Note that this may be 0
    </ul>

    This function preforms a step of the authentication. This may need
    to be called an arbitrary number of times. If the program returns
    SASL_CONTINUE that means <tt>serverout</tt> should be sent to the
    client. If SASL_OK is returned that means authentication is
    complete and the application should tell the client the
    authentication was successful. Any other return code means the
    authentication failed and the client should be notified of this.

      <li>plen - Number of characters in the result string
      <li>pcount - Number of mechanisms listed in the result string
    </ul>

    This function is used to create a string with a list of SASL
    mechanisms supported by the server. This string is often needed
    for a capability statement.

    </pre>

    <ul>Parameters:
      <li>conn - The context for this connection
      <li>user - The user trying to check the password for
      <li>userlen - The user length
      <li>pass - The password

<a name="common_section"><h2>Common Section</h2></a>

    <a name="callbacks_interactions"><h3>Callbacks and Interactions</h3></a>

    When the application starts and calls sasl_client_init() you must
    specify for what data you support callbacks and/or
    interactions. These are for the library getting information needed
    for authentication from the application. This is needed for things
    like authentication name and password. If you do not declare
    supporting a callback you will not be able to use mechanisms that
    need that data. A callback is for when you have the information
    before you start the authentication. The SASL library calls a
    function you specify and your function fills in the requested
    information. For example if you had the userid of the user already
    for some reason. An interaction is usually for things you support
    but will need to ask the user for
    (e.g. password). sasl_client_start() or sasl_client_step() will
    return SASL_INTERACT. This will be a list of sasl_interact_t's
    which contain a human readable string you can prompt the user
    with, a possible computer readable string, and a default
    result. The nice thing about interactions is you get them all at
    once so if you had a GUI application you could bring up a dialog
    box asking for authentication name and password together instead
    of one at a time.<p>
    Any memory that is given to the SASL library for the purposes of
    callbacks and interactions must persist until the exchange completes
    in either success or failure.  That is, the data must persist until
    <tt>sasl_client_start</tt> or <tt>sasl_client_step</tt> returns something
    other than <tt>SASL_INTERACT</tt> or <tt>SASL_CONTINUE</tt>.

    <p><b>Memory management:</b>As in the rest of the SASLv2 API,
    whoever allocates the memory is responsible for freeing it.
    In almost all cases this should be fairly easy to manage, however
    a slight exception where the interaction sasl_interact_t structure
    is allocated and freed by the library, while the results are allocated
    and freed by the application.  As noted above, however, <i>the results
    may not be freed until after the exchange completes, in either success
    or failure</i>.

    <p>For a detailed description of what each of the callback types are
    see the sasl.h file. Here are some brief explanations:
    <ul>
    <li> SASL_CB_AUTHNAME - the name of the user authenticating
    <li> SASL_CB_USER - the name of the user acting for. 
    (for example postman delivering mail for tmartin might have an
    AUTHNAME of postman and a USER of tmartin)
    <li> SASL_CB_PASS - password for AUTHNAME
    <li> SASL_CB_GETREALM - Realm of the server
    </ul>
    
    An example of a way to handle callbacks:
    
    <pre>
    /* callbacks we support. This is a global variable at the 
       top of the program */
    static sasl_callback_t callbacks[] = {
    {
      SASL_CB_GETREALM, NULL, NULL  /* we'll just use an interaction if this comes up */
    }, {
      SASL_CB_USER, NULL, NULL      /* we'll just use an interaction if this comes up */
    }, {
      SASL_CB_AUTHNAME, &getauthname_func, NULL /* A mechanism should call getauthname_func
                                                   if it needs the authentication name */
    }, { 
      SASL_CB_PASS, &getsecret_func, NULL      /* Call getsecret_func if need secret */
    }, {
      SASL_CB_LIST_END, NULL, NULL
    }
    };


    static int getsecret_func(sasl_conn_t *conn,
	  void *context __attribute__((unused)),
	  int id,
	  sasl_secret_t **psecret)
    {
       [ask the user for their secret]

       [allocate psecret and insert the secret]

      return SASL_OK;
    }

    static int getauthname_func(void *context,
                                int id,
                                const char **result,
                                unsigned *len)
    {
       if (id!=SASL_CB_AUTHNAME) return SASL_FAIL;

       [fill in result and len]

       return SASL_OK;
     }

    
    in the main program somewhere
    
    sasl_client_init(callbacks);

    </pre>

    <a name="layers"><h3>Security layers</h3></a>

<pre>rough notes
alls well and good to authenticate, but if you don't use integrity or
encryption, anyone can hijack your tcp session... thus...

server sets SASL_SEC_PROPS with a desired buffer size X of the amount of data
it will be using to read() from the socket.

libsasl passes this number to the mechanism.

the mechanism then negotiates with the other size so that "maxbuf" is less
than or equal to this number X.

libsasl then returns (via SASL_MAXOUTBUF) the maximum amount of plaintext
material that can be encoded at any one time, Y.

Y will be strictly less than X.  If the other side of the connection was good
with X, Y will probably be only slightly less than X.

the prot layer now calls sasl_encode every time Y bytes are written (the
output buffer size is Y).  it will read in sizes of X (the input buffer size
it told sasl).  since it reads in sizes of X, excluding pathological cases,
every time it calls read() it will get at least one sasl blob which
sasl_decode will return the plaintext data for.

all is happy.

it's the same for the client.

<a name="example_section"><h2>Example applications that come with the Cyrus SASL library</h2></a>

<a name="sample_client"><h3><tt>sample-client</tt> and <tt>sample-server</tt></h3></a>

The sample client and server included with this distribution were
initially written to help debug mechanisms.  They base64 encode all
the data and print it out on standard output.

<p>Make sure that you set the IP addresses, the username, the
authenticate name, and anything else on the command line (some
mechanisms depend on these being present).

<p>Also, sometimes you will receive a get "<tt>realm: Information not
available</tt>" message, or similar; this is due to the fact that some
mechanisms do not support realms and therefore never set it.

<a name="cyrus_imapd"><h3>Cyrus imapd v2.1.0 or later</h3></a>

The Cyrus IMAP server now incorporates SASLv2 for all its
authentication needs.  It is a good example of a fairly large server
application.  Also of interest is the prot layer, included in
libcyrus.  This is a stdio-like interface that automatically takes
care of layers using a simple "<tt>prot_setsasl()</tt>" call.

<p>Cyrus imapd also sets a <tt>SASL_CB_PROXY_POLICY</tt> callback,
which should be of interest to many applications.

<a name="imtest"><h3><tt>imtest</tt>, from Cyrus 2.1.0 or later</h3></a>

<tt>imtest</tt> is an application included with Cyrus imapd.  It is a
very simple IMAP client, but should be of interest to those writing
applications.  It also uses the prot layer, but it is easy to
incorporate similar support without using the prot layer.  Likewise,
there are other sample client applications that you can look at including
<tt>smtptest</tt> and <tt>pop3test</tt> in the SASL distribution and the Cyrus
IMAPd distribution, respectively.

<a name="random_things"><h2>Miscellaneous Information</h2></a>

<a name="empty_exchanges"><h3>Empty exchanges</h3></a>

<p>Some SASL mechanisms intentionally send no data; an application should
be prepared to either send or receive an empty exchange.  The SASL
profile for the protocol should define how to send an empty string;
make sure to send an empty string when requested, and when receiving
an empty string make sure that the "<tt>inlength</tt>" passed in is 0.</p>

<p>Note especially that the distinction between the empty string "" and
the lack of a string (NULL) is extremely important in many cases (most
notably, the client-send first scenario), and the application must ensure
that it is passing the correct values to the SASL library at all times.</p>

<a name="idle"><h3>Idle</h3></a>

While the implementation & plugins correctly implement the idle calls,
none of them currently do anything.
