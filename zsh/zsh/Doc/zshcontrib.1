.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The Zsh source distribution includes a number of items contributed by the
user community\&.  These are not inherently a part of the shell, and some
may not be available in every zsh installation\&.  The most significant of
these are documented here\&.  For documentation on other contributed items
such as shell functions, look for comments in the function source files\&.

.SS "Accessing On\-Line Help"
.PP
The key sequence \fBESC h\fP is normally bound by ZLE to execute the
\fBrun\-help\fP widget (see
\fIzshzle\fP(1))\&.  This invokes the \fBrun\-help\fP command with the command word from the
current input line as its argument\&.  By default, \fBrun\-help\fP is an alias
for the \fBman\fP command, so this often fails when the command word is a
shell builtin or a user\-defined function\&.  By redefining the \fBrun\-help\fP
alias, one can improve the on\-line help provided by the shell\&.
.PP
The \fBhelpfiles\fP utility, found in the \fBUtil\fP directory of the
distribution, is a Perl program that can be used to process the zsh manual
to produce a separate help file for each shell builtin and for many other
shell features as well\&.  The autoloadable \fBrun\-help\fP function, found in
\fBFunctions/Misc\fP, searches for these helpfiles and performs several
other tests to produce the most complete help possible for the command\&.
.PP
There may already be a directory of help files on your system; look in
\fB/usr/share/zsh\fP or \fB/usr/local/share/zsh\fP and subdirectories below
those, or ask your system administrator\&.
.PP
To create your own help files with \fBhelpfiles\fP, choose or create a
directory where the individual command help files will reside\&.  For
example, you might choose \fB~/zsh_help\fP\&.  If you unpacked the zsh
distribution in your home directory, you would use the commands:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBmkdir ~/zsh_help
cd ~/zsh_help
man zshall | colcrt \- | \e 
perl ~/zsh\-4\&.3\&.9/Util/helpfiles\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Next, to use the \fBrun\-help\fP function, you need to add lines something
like the following to your \fB\&.zshrc\fP or equivalent startup file:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBunalias run\-help
autoload run\-help
HELPDIR=~/zsh_help\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The \fBHELPDIR\fP parameter tells \fBrun\-help\fP where to look for the help
files\&.  If your system already has a help file directory installed, set
\fBHELPDIR\fP to the path of that directory instead\&.
.PP
Note that in order for `\fBautoload run\-help\fP\&' to work, the \fBrun\-help\fP
file must be in one of the directories named in your \fBfpath\fP array (see
\fIzshparam\fP(1))\&.  This should already be the case if you have a standard zsh
installation; if it is not, copy \fBFunctions/Misc/run\-help\fP to an
appropriate directory\&.
.PP
.SS "Recompiling Functions"
.PP
If you frequently edit your zsh functions, or periodically update your zsh
installation to track the latest developments, you may find that function
digests compiled with the \fBzcompile\fP builtin are frequently out of date
with respect to the function source files\&.  This is not usually a problem,
because zsh always looks for the newest file when loading a function, but
it may cause slower shell startup and function loading\&.  Also, if a digest
file is explicitly used as an element of \fBfpath\fP, zsh won\&'t check whether
any of its source files has changed\&.
.PP
The \fBzrecompile\fP autoloadable function, found in \fBFunctions/Misc\fP, can
be used to keep function digests up to date\&.

\fBzrecompile\fP [ \fB\-qt\fP ] \fB\-p\fP \fIargs\fP [ \fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP \fIargs\fP \&.\&.\&. ]
This tries to find \fB*\&.zwc\fP files and automatically re\-compile them if at
least one of the original files is newer than the compiled file\&.  This
works only if the names stored in the compiled files are full paths or are
relative to the directory that contains the \fB\&.zwc\fP file\&.
.RS
.PP
In the first form, each \fIname\fP is the name of a compiled file or a
directory containing \fB*\&.zwc\fP files that should be checked\&.  If no
arguments are given, the directories and \fB*\&.zwc\fP files in \fBfpath\fP are
used\&.
.PP
When \fB\-t\fP is given, no compilation is performed, but a return status of
zero (true) is set if there are files that need to be re\-compiled and
non\-zero (false) otherwise\&.  The \fB\-q\fP option quiets the chatty output
that describes what \fBzrecompile\fP is doing\&.
.PP
Without the \fB\-t\fP option, the return status is zero if all files that
needed re\-compilation could be compiled and non\-zero if compilation for at
least one of the files failed\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-p\fP option is given, the \fIargs\fP are interpreted as one
or more sets of arguments for \fBzcompile\fP, separated by `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&'\&.
For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzrecompile \-p \e 
           \-R ~/\&.zshrc \-\- \e 
           \-M ~/\&.zcompdump \-\- \e 
           ~/zsh/comp\&.zwc ~/zsh/Completion/*/_*\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This compiles \fB~/\&.zshrc\fP into \fB~/\&.zshrc\&.zwc\fP if that doesn\&'t exist or
if it is older than \fB~/\&.zshrc\fP\&. The compiled file will be marked for
reading instead of mapping\&. The same is done for \fB~/\&.zcompdump\fP and
\fB~/\&.zcompdump\&.zwc\fP, but this compiled file is marked for mapping\&. The
last line re\-creates the file \fB~/zsh/comp\&.zwc\fP if any of the files
matching the given pattern is newer than it\&.
.PP
Without the \fB\-p\fP option, \fBzrecompile\fP does not create function digests
that do not already exist, nor does it add new functions to the digest\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
The following shell loop is an example of a method for creating function
digests for all functions in your \fBfpath\fP, assuming that you have write
permission to the directories:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBfor ((i=1; i <= $#fpath; ++i)); do
  dir=$fpath[i]
  zwc=${dir:t}\&.zwc
  if [[ $dir == (\&.|\&.\&.) || $dir == (\&.|\&.\&.)/* ]]; then
    continue
  fi
  files=($dir/*(N\-\&.))
  if [[ \-w $dir:h && \-n $files ]]; then
    files=(${${(M)files%/*/*}#/})
    if ( cd $dir:h &&
         zrecompile \-p \-U \-z $zwc $files ); then
      fpath[i]=$fpath[i]\&.zwc
    fi
  fi
done\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The \fB\-U\fP and \fB\-z\fP options are appropriate for functions in the default
zsh installation \fBfpath\fP; you may need to use different options for your
personal function directories\&.
.PP
Once the digests have been created and your \fBfpath\fP modified to refer to
them, you can keep them up to date by running \fBzrecompile\fP with no
arguments\&.
.PP
.SS "Keyboard Definition"
.PP
The large number of possible combinations of keyboards, workstations,
terminals, emulators, and window systems makes it impossible for zsh to
have built\-in key bindings for every situation\&.  The \fBzkbd\fP utility,
found in Functions/Misc, can help you quickly create key bindings for your
configuration\&.
.PP
Run \fBzkbd\fP either as an autoloaded function, or as a shell script:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzsh \-f ~/zsh\-4\&.3\&.9/Functions/Misc/zkbd\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
When you run \fBzkbd\fP, it first asks you to enter your terminal type; if
the default it offers is correct, just press return\&.  It then asks you to
press a number of different keys to determine characteristics of your
keyboard and terminal; \fBzkbd\fP warns you if it finds anything out of the
ordinary, such as a Delete key that sends neither \fB^H\fP nor \fB^?\fP\&.
.PP
The keystrokes read by \fBzkbd\fP are recorded as a definition for an
associative array named \fBkey\fP, written to a file in the subdirectory
\fB\&.zkbd\fP within either your \fBHOME\fP or \fBZDOTDIR\fP directory\&.  The name
of the file is composed from the \fBTERM\fP, \fBVENDOR\fP and \fBOSTYPE\fP
parameters, joined by hyphens\&.
.PP
You may read this file into your \fB\&.zshrc\fP or another startup file with
the `\fBsource\fP\&' or `\fB\&.\fP' commands, then reference the \fBkey\fP parameter
in bindkey commands, like this:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBsource ${ZDOTDIR:\-$HOME}/\&.zkbd/$TERM\-$VENDOR\-$OSTYPE
[[ \-n ${key[Left]} ]] && bindkey "${key[Left]}" backward\-char
[[ \-n ${key[Right]} ]] && bindkey "${key[Right]}" forward\-char
# etc\&.\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that in order for `\fBautoload zkbd\fP\&' to work, the \fBzkdb\fP file must
be in one of the directories named in your \fBfpath\fP array (see
\fIzshparam\fP(1))\&.  This should already be the case if you have a standard zsh
installation; if it is not, copy \fBFunctions/Misc/zkbd\fP to an
appropriate directory\&.
.PP
.SS "Dumping Shell State"
.PP
Occasionally you may encounter what appears to be a bug in the shell,
particularly if you are using a beta version of zsh or a development
release\&.  Usually it is sufficient to send a description of the
problem to one of the zsh mailing lists (see
\fIzsh\fP(1)), but sometimes one of the zsh developers will need to recreate your
environment in order to track the problem down\&.
.PP
The script named \fBreporter\fP, found in the \fBUtil\fP directory of the
distribution, is provided for this purpose\&.  (It is also possible to
\fBautoload reporter\fP, but \fBreporter\fP is not installed in \fBfpath\fP
by default\&.)  This script outputs a detailed dump of the shell state,
in the form of another script that can be read with `\fBzsh \-f\fP\&' to
recreate that state\&.
.PP
To use \fBreporter\fP, read the script into your shell with the `\fB\&.\fP\&'
command and redirect the output into a file:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB\&. ~/zsh\-4\&.3\&.9/Util/reporter > zsh\&.report\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
You should check the \fBzsh\&.report\fP file for any sensitive information
such as passwords and delete them by hand before sending the script to the
developers\&.  Also, as the output can be voluminous, it\&'s best to wait for
the developers to ask for this information before sending it\&.
.PP
You can also use \fBreporter\fP to dump only a subset of the shell state\&.
This is sometimes useful for creating startup files for the first time\&.
Most of the output from reporter is far more detailed than usually is
necessary for a startup file, but the \fBaliases\fP, \fBoptions\fP, and
\fBzstyles\fP states may be useful because they include only changes from
the defaults\&.  The \fBbindings\fP state may be useful if you have created
any of your own keymaps, because \fBreporter\fP arranges to dump the keymap
creation commands as well as the bindings for every keymap\&.
.PP
As is usual with automated tools, if you create a startup file with
\fBreporter\fP, you should edit the results to remove unnecessary commands\&.
Note that if you\&'re using the new completion system, you should \fInot\fP
dump the \fBfunctions\fP state to your startup files with \fBreporter\fP; use
the \fBcompdump\fP function instead (see
\fIzshcompsys\fP(1))\&.

Several functions are special to the shell, as described in the section
SPECIAL FUNCTIONS, see \fIzshmisc\fP(1),
in that they are automatic called at a specific point during shell execution\&.
Each has an associated array consisting of names of functions to be
called at the same point; these are so\-called `hook functions\&'\&.

.SH "GATHERING INFORMATION FROM VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS"

In a lot of cases, it is nice to automatically retrieve information from
version control systems (VCSs), such as subversion, CVS or git, to be able
to provide it to the user; possibly in the user\&'s prompt\&. So that you can
instantly tell on which branch you are currently on,  for example\&.

Obviously, the last two lines are there for demonstration: You need to
call \fIvcs_info\fP from your \fIprecmd\fP function\&. Once that is done you need
a \fBsingle quoted\fP \fI\&'${vcs_info_msg_0_}'\fP in your prompt\&.

You may not want all of these because there is no point in running the
code to detect systems you do not use\&.  So there is a way to disable
some backends altogether:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':vcs_info:*' disable bzr cdv darcs mtn svk tla\fP

You may also pick a few from that list and enable only those:

If you rerun \fBvcs_info_printsys\fP after one of these commands, you will
see the backends listed in the \fIdisable\fP style (or backends not in the

.TP
\fB<repo\-root\-name>\fP

\fIzsh\fP to make it so\&.
.PP
There are three special values for \fB<vcs\-string>\fP: The first is named
\fI\-init\-\fP, that is in effect as long as there was no decision what vcs
backend to use\&. The second is \fI\-preinit\-\fP; it is used \fBbefore\fP
\fIvcs_info\fP is run, when initializing the data exporting variables\&. The
third special value is \fIformats\fP and is used by the \fBvcs_info_lastmsg\fP

\fBnvcsformats\fP
These "formats" are exported, when we didn\&'t detect
a version control system for the current directory\&. This is useful, if you

backend is used at all and \fIvcs_info\fP will do nothing\&. If this list
contains \fBALL\fP \fIvcs_info\fP will use all backends known to it\&. Only with
\fBALL\fP in \fBenable\fP, the \fBdisable\fP style has any effect\&. \fBALL\fP and
\fBNONE\fP are actually tested case insensitively\&.

.TP
\fBuse\-server\fP
This is used by the Perforce backend (\fBp4\fP) to decide if it should
contact the Perforce server to find out if a directory is managed
by Perforce\&.  This is the only reliable way of doing this, but runs
the risk of a delay if the server name cannot be found\&.  If the
server (more specifically, the \fIhost\fP\fB:\fP\fIport\fP pair describing the
server) cannot be contacted its name is put into the associative array
\fBvcs_info_p4_dead_servers\fP and not contacted again during the session
until it is removed by hand\&.  If you do not set this style, the \fBp4\fP
backend is only usable if you have set the environment variable
\fBP4CONFIG\fP to a file name and have corresponding files in the root
directories of each Perforce client\&.  See comments in the function
\fBVCS_INFO_detect_p4\fP for more detail\&.
.TP
\fBuse\-simple\fP
If there are two different ways of gathering
information, you can select the simpler one by setting this style to true;

The eight `\fB\-match\fP\&' functions are drop\-in replacements for the
builtin widgets without the suffix\&.  By default they behave in a similar
way\&.  However, by the use of styles and the function \fBselect\-word\-style\fP,
the way words are matched can be altered\&.
.RS
.PP
The simplest way of configuring the functions is to use
\fBselect\-word\-style\fP, which can either be called as a normal function with
the appropriate argument, or invoked as a user\-defined widget that will
prompt for the first character of the word style to be used\&.  The first
time it is invoked, the eight \fB\-match\fP functions will automatically
replace the builtin versions, so they do not need to be loaded explicitly\&.
.PP
The word styles available are as follows\&.  Only the first character
is examined\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBbash\fP
Word characters are alphanumeric characters only\&.

\fBnormal\fP

\fB$WORDCHARS\fP\&.

\fBshell\fP
Words are complete shell command arguments, possibly including complete
quoted strings, or any tokens special to the shell\&.
.TP
\fBwhitespace\fP
Words are any set of characters delimited by whitespace\&.
.TP
\fBdefault\fP
Restore the default settings; this is usually the same as `\fBnormal\fP\&'\&.
.PP
All but `\fBdefault\fP\&' can be input as an upper case character, which has
the same effect but with subword matching turned on\&.  In this case, words
with upper case characters are treated specially: each separate run of
upper case characters, or an upper case character followed by any number of
other characters, is considered a word\&.  The style \fBsubword\-range\fP
can supply an alternative character range to the default `\fB[:upper:]\fP\&';
the value of the style is treated as the contents of a `\fB[\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB]\fP\&'
pattern (note that the outer brackets should not be supplied, only
those surrounding named ranges)\&.
.PP
More control can be obtained using the \fBzstyle\fP command, as described in
\fIzshmodules\fP(1)\&.  Each style is looked up in the
context \fB:zle:\fP\fIwidget\fP where \fIwidget\fP is the name of the
user\-defined widget, not the name of the function implementing it, so in
the case of the definitions supplied by \fBselect\-word\-style\fP the
appropriate contexts are \fB:zle:forward\-word\fP, and so on\&.  The function
\fBselect\-word\-style\fP itself always defines styles for the context
`\fB:zle:*\fP\&' which can be overridden by more specific (longer) patterns as
well as explicit contexts\&.
.PP
The style \fBword\-style\fP specifies the rules to use\&.  This may have the
following values\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBnormal\fP
Use the standard shell rules, i\&.e\&. alphanumerics and \fB$WORDCHARS\fP, unless
overridden by the styles \fBword\-chars\fP or \fBword\-class\fP\&.
.TP
\fBspecified\fP
Similar to \fBnormal\fP, but \fIonly\fP the specified characters, and not also
alphanumerics, are considered word characters\&.
.TP
\fBunspecified\fP
The negation of specified\&.  The given characters are those which will
\fInot\fP be considered part of a word\&.
.TP
\fBshell\fP
Words are obtained by using the syntactic rules for generating shell
command arguments\&.  In addition, special tokens which are never command
arguments such as `\fB()\fP\&' are also treated as words\&.
.TP
\fBwhitespace\fP
Words are whitespace\-delimited strings of characters\&.
.PP
The first three of those rules usually use \fB$WORDCHARS\fP, but the value
in the parameter can be overridden by the style \fBword\-chars\fP, which works
in exactly the same way as \fB$WORDCHARS\fP\&.  In addition, the style
\fBword\-class\fP uses character class syntax to group characters and takes
precedence over \fBword\-chars\fP if both are set\&.  The \fBword\-class\fP style
does not include the surrounding brackets of the character class; for
example, `\fB\-:[:alnum:]\fP\&' is a valid \fBword\-class\fP to include all
alphanumerics plus the characters `\fB\-\fP\&' and `\fB:\fP'\&.  Be careful
including `\fB]\fP\&', `\fB^\fP' and `\fB\-\fP' as these are special inside
character classes\&.
.PP
\fBword\-style\fP may also have `\fB\-subword\fP\&' appended to its value to
turn on subword matching, as described above\&.
.PP
The style \fBskip\-chars\fP is mostly useful for
\fBtranspose\-words\fP and similar functions\&.  If set, it gives a count of
characters starting at the cursor position which will not be considered
part of the word and are treated as space, regardless of what they actually
are\&.  For example, if
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':zle:transpose\-words' skip\-chars 1\fP

.RE
.PP
has been set, and \fBtranspose\-words\-match\fP is called with the cursor on
the \fIX\fP of \fBfoo\fP\fIX\fP\fBbar\fP, where \fIX\fP can be any character, then
the resulting expression is \fBbar\fP\fIX\fP\fBfoo\fP\&.
.PP
Finer grained control can be obtained by setting the style \fBword\-context\fP
to an array of pairs of entries\&.  Each pair of entries consists of a
\fIpattern\fP and a \fIsubcontext\fP\&.  The shell argument the cursor is on is
matched against each \fIpattern\fP in turn until one matches; if it does,
the context is extended by a colon and the corresponding \fIsubcontext\fP\&.
Note that the test is made against the original word on the line, with no
stripping of quotes\&.  Special handling is done between words: the current
context is examined and if it contains the string \fBback\fP, the word before
the cursor is considered, else the word after cursor is considered\&. Some
examples are given below\&.
.PP
Here are some examples of use of the styles, actually taken from the
simplified interface in \fBselect\-word\-style\fP:

This provides two different ways of using \fBtranspose\-words\fP depending on
whether the cursor is on whitespace between words or on a filename, here
any word containing a \fB/\fP\&.  On whitespace, complete arguments as defined
by standard shell rules will be transposed\&.  In a filename, only
alphanumerics will be transposed\&.  Elsewhere, words will be transposed
using the default style for \fB:zle:transpose\-words\fP\&.
.PP
The word matching and all the handling of \fBzstyle\fP settings is actually
implemented by the function \fBmatch\-words\-by\-style\fP\&.  This can be used to
create new user\-defined widgets\&.  The calling function should set the local
parameter \fBcurcontext\fP to \fB:zle:\fP\fIwidget\fP, create the local
parameter \fBmatched_words\fP and call \fBmatch\-words\-by\-style\fP with no
arguments\&.  On return, \fBmatched_words\fP will be set to an array with the
elements: (1) the start of the line (2) the word before the cursor (3) any
non\-word characters between that word and the cursor (4) any non\-word
character at the cursor position plus any remaining non\-word characters
before the next word, including all characters specified by the
\fBskip\-chars\fP style, (5) the word at or following the cursor (6) any
non\-word characters following that word (7) the remainder of the line\&.  Any
of the elements may be an empty string; the calling function should test

This function allows you to compose characters that don\&'t appear on the

two keys corresponding to ASCII characters (there is no prompt)\&.  For
accented characters, the two keys are a base character followed by a code
for the accent, while for other special characters the two characters
together form a mnemonic for the character to be inserted\&.  The
two\-character codes are a subset of those given by RFC 1345 (see for
example \fBhttp://www\&.faqs\&.org/rfcs/rfc1345\&.html\fP)\&.
.RS

The function may optionally be followed by up to two characters which
replace one or both of the characters read from the keyboard; if both
characters are supplied, no input is read\&.  For example,
\fBinsert\-composed\-char a:\fP can be used within a widget to insert an a with
umlaut into the command line\&.  This has the advantages over use of a
literal character that it is more portable\&.

\fBnarrow\-to\-region\fP may be used as a widget or called as a function from a
user\-defined widget; by default, the text outside the editable area remains
visible\&.  A \fBrecursive\-edit\fP is performed and the original widening
status is then restored\&.  Various options and arguments are available when
it is called as a function\&.
.PP
The options \fB\-p\fP \fIpretext\fP and \fB\-P\fP \fIposttext\fP may be
used to replace the text before and after the display for the duration of
the function; either or both may be an empty string\&.
.PP
If the option \fB\-n\fP is also given, \fIpretext\fP or \fIposttext\fP will only
be inserted if there is text before or after the region respectively which
will be made invisible\&.
.PP
Two numeric arguments may be given which will be used instead of the cursor

.PP
The option \fB\-S\fP \fIstatepm\fP is used to narrow according to the other
options while saving the original state in the parameter with name
\fIstatepm\fP, while the option \fB\-R\fP \fIstatepm\fP is used to restore the
state from the parameter; note in both cases the \fIname\fP of the parameter
is required\&.  In the second case, other options and arguments are
irrelevant\&.  When this method is used, no \fBrecursive\-edit\fP is performed;
the calling widget should call this function with the option \fB\-S\fP,
perform its own editing on the command line or pass control to the user
via `\fBzle recursive\-edit\fP\&', then call this function with the option
\fB\-R\fP\&.  The argument \fIstatepm\fP must be a suitable name for an ordinary
parameter, except that parameters beginning with the prefix \fB_ntr_\fP are
reserved for use within \fBnarrow\-to\-region\fP\&.  Typically the parameter will
be local to the calling function\&.

\fBnarrow\-to\-region\-invisible\fP is a simple widget which calls

\fBpredict\-on\fP
This set of functions implements predictive typing using history search\&.
After \fBpredict\-on\fP, typing characters causes the editor to look backward
in the history for the first line beginning with what you have typed so
far\&.  After \fBpredict\-off\fP, editing returns to normal for the line found\&.
In fact, you often don\&'t even need to use \fBpredict\-off\fP, because if the
line doesn\&'t match something in the history, adding a key performs
standard completion, and then inserts itself if no completions were found\&.
However, editing in the middle of a line is liable to confuse prediction;
see the \fBtoggle\fP style below\&.
.RS
.PP
With the function based completion system (which is needed for this), you
should be able to type \fBTAB\fP at almost any point to advance the cursor
to the next ``interesting\&'' character position (usually the end of the
current word, but sometimes somewhere in the middle of the word)\&.  And of
course as soon as the entire line is what you want, you can accept with
return, without needing to move the cursor to the end first\&.

\fBread\-from\-minibuffer\fP
This is most useful when called as a function from inside a widget, but will
work correctly as a widget in its own right\&.  It prompts for a value
below the current command line; a value may be input using all of the
standard zle operations (and not merely the restricted set available
when executing, for example, \fBexecute\-named\-cmd\fP)\&.  The value is then
returned to the calling function in the parameter \fB$REPLY\fP and the
editing buffer restored to its previous state\&.  If the read was aborted
by a keyboard break (typically \fB^G\fP), the function returns status 1
and \fB$REPLY\fP is not set\&.
.RS
.PP
If one argument is supplied to the function it is taken as a prompt,
otherwise `\fB? \fP\&' is used\&.  If two arguments are supplied, they are the
prompt and the initial value of \fB$LBUFFER\fP, and if a third argument is
given it is the initial value of \fB$RBUFFER\fP\&.  This provides a default
value and starting cursor placement\&.  Upon return the entire buffer is the
value of \fB$REPLY\fP\&.
.PP
One option is available: `\fB\-k\fP \fInum\fP\&' specifies that \fInum\fP
characters are to be read instead of a whole line\&.  The line editor is not
invoked recursively in this case, so depending on the terminal settings
the input may not be visible, and only the input keys are placed in
\fB$REPLY\fP, not the entire buffer\&.  Note that unlike the \fBread\fP builtin
\fInum\fP must be given; there is no default\&.
.PP
The name is a slight misnomer, as in fact the shell\&'s own minibuffer is
not used\&.  Hence it is still possible to call \fBexecuted\-named\-cmd\fP and
similar functions while reading a value\&.

\fBreplace\-string\fP, \fBreplace\-pattern\fP
.TP
.PD
\fBreplace\-string\-again\fP, \fBreplace\-pattern\-again\fP
The function \fBreplace\-string\fP implements two widgets\&.
If defined under the same name as the function, it prompts for two
strings; the first (source) string will be replaced by the second
everywhere it occurs in the line editing buffer\&.
.RS
.PP
If the widget name contains the word `\fBpattern\fP\&', for example by
defining the widget using the command `\fBzle \-N replace\-pattern
replace\-string\fP\&', then the replacement is done by pattern matching\&.  All
zsh extended globbing patterns can be used in the source string; note
that unlike filename generation the pattern does not need to match an
entire word, nor do glob qualifiers have any effect\&.  In addition, the
replacement string can contain parameter or command substitutions\&.
Furthermore, a `\fB&\fP\&' in the replacement string will be replaced with
the matched source string, and a backquoted digit `\fB\e\fP\fIN\fP\&' will be
replaced by the \fIN\fPth parenthesised expression matched\&.  The form
`\fB\e{\fP\fIN\fP\fB}\fP\&' may be used to protect the digit from following
digits\&.
.PP
By default the previous source or replacement string will not be offered
for editing\&.  However, this feature can be activated by setting the style
\fBedit\-previous\fP in the context \fB:zle:\fP\fIwidget\fP (for example,
\fB:zle:replace\-string\fP) to \fBtrue\fP\&.  In addition, a positive
numeric argument forces the previous values to be offered, a negative or
zero argument forces them not to be\&.
.PP
The function \fBreplace\-string\-again\fP can be used to repeat the
previous replacement; no prompting is done\&.  As with \fBreplace\-string\fP, if
the name of the widget contains the word `\fBpattern\fP\&', pattern matching
is performed, else a literal string replacement\&.  Note that the
previous source and replacement text are the same whether pattern or string
matching is used\&.
.PP
For example, starting from the line:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBprint This line contains fan and fond\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
and invoking \fBreplace\-pattern\fP with the source string
`\fBf(?)n\fP\&' and
the replacement string `\fBc\e1r\fP\&' produces the not very useful line:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBprint This line contains car and cord\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The range of the replacement string can be limited by using the
\fBnarrow\-to\-region\-invisible\fP widget\&.  One limitation of the current
version is that \fBundo\fP will cycle through changes to the replacement
and source strings before undoing the replacement itself\&.

With a numeric prefix, or when passed command line arguments in a call

words in comments are ignored when \fBINTERACTIVE_COMMENTS\fP is set\&.
.PP
Otherwise, the rightmost ``interesting\&'' word from the previous command is
found and inserted\&.  The default definition of ``interesting\&'' is that the
word contains at least one alphabetic character, slash, or backslash\&.
This definition may be overridden by use of the \fBmatch\fP style\&.  The
context used to look up the style is the widget name, so usually the
context is \fB:insert\-last\-word\fP\&.  However, you can bind this function to
different widgets to use different patterns:
.PP
.RS

.PP
If no interesting word is found and the \fBauto\-previous\fP style is set to

\fBwhich\-command\fP

\fBwhich\-command\fP\&.  It has enhanced behaviour, in that it correctly

before the first argument, and finishing with any whitespace after the last
argument\&.  Hence (so long as the option \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP is not set)
whitespace is given by odd indices in the array and arguments by
even indices\&.  Note that no stripping of quotes is done; joining together
all the elements of \fBreply\fP in order is guaranteed to produce the
original line\&.

The parameter \fBREPLY\fP is set to the index of the word in \fBreply\fP which

\fBcompleter\fP
The \fBincremental\-complete\-word\fP and \fBinsert\-and\-predict\fP widgets set

It is a good idea to restrict the completers used in prediction, because

Two functions are provided to enable zsh to provide exception handling in a
form that should be familiar from other languages\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBthrow\fP \fIexception\fP
The function \fBthrow\fP throws the named \fIexception\fP\&.  The name is
an arbitrary string and is only used by the \fBthrow\fP and \fBcatch\fP
functions\&.  An exception is for the most part treated the same as a
shell error, i\&.e\&. an unhandled exception will cause the shell to abort all
processing in a function or script and to return to the top level in an
interactive shell\&.
.TP
\fBcatch\fP \fIexception\-pattern\fP
The function \fBcatch\fP returns status zero if an exception was thrown and
the pattern \fIexception\-pattern\fP matches its name\&.  Otherwise it
returns status 1\&.  \fIexception\-pattern\fP is a standard
shell pattern, respecting the current setting of the \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP
option\&.  An alias \fBcatch\fP is also defined to prevent the argument to the
function from matching filenames, so patterns may be used unquoted\&.  Note
that as exceptions are not fundamentally different from other shell errors
it is possible to catch shell errors by using an empty string as the
exception name\&.  The shell variable \fBCAUGHT\fP is set by \fBcatch\fP to the
name of the exception caught\&.  It is possible to rethrow an exception by
calling the \fBthrow\fP function again once an exception has been caught\&.
.PP
The functions are designed to be used together with the \fBalways\fP construct
described in
\fIzshmisc\fP(1)\&.  This is important as only this
construct provides the required support for exceptions\&.  A typical example
is as follows\&.
.PP

\fB{
  # "try" block
  # \&.\&.\&. nested code here calls "throw MyExcept"

  fi
}\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
In common with exception handling in other languages, the exception may be
thrown by code deeply nested inside the `try\&' block\&.  However, note that it
must be thrown inside the current shell, not in a subshell forked for a
pipeline, parenthesised current\-shell construct, or some form of
command or process substitution\&.
.PP
The system internally uses the shell variable \fBEXCEPTION\fP to record the
name of the exception between throwing and catching\&.  One drawback of this
scheme is that if the exception is not handled the variable \fBEXCEPTION\fP
remains set and may be incorrectly recognised as the name of an exception
if a shell error subsequently occurs\&.  Adding \fBunset EXCEPTION\fP at the
start of the outermost layer of any code that uses exception handling will
eliminate this problem\&.
.PP
.SH "MIME FUNCTIONS"

.PD 0
\fBzsh\-mime\-setup\fP [ \fB\-fv\fP ] [ \fB\-l\fP [ \fIsuffix \&.\&.\&.\fP ] ]
.TP

\fBzsh\-mime\-handler\fP
These two functions use the files \fB~/\&.mime\&.types\fP and \fB/etc/mime\&.types\fP,
which associate types and extensions, as well as \fB~/\&.mailcap\fP and
\fB/etc/mailcap\fP files, which associate types and the programs that
handle them\&.  These are provided on many systems with the Multimedia
Internet Mail Extensions\&.
.RS
.PP
To enable the system, the function \fBzsh\-mime\-setup\fP should be
autoloaded and run\&.  This allows files with extensions to be treated
as executable; such files be completed by the function completion system\&.
The function \fBzsh\-mime\-handler\fP should not need to be called by the
user\&.
.PP
The system works by setting up suffix aliases with `\fBalias \-s\fP\&'\&.
Suffix aliases already installed by the user will not be overwritten\&.
.PP
Repeated calls to \fBzsh\-mime\-setup\fP do not override the existing
mapping between suffixes and executable files unless the option \fB\-f\fP
is given\&.  Note, however, that this does not override existing suffix
aliases assigned to handlers other than \fBzsh\-mime\-handler\fP\&.
.PP
Calling \fBzsh\-mime\-setup\fP with the option \fB\-l\fP lists the existing
mappings without altering them\&.  Suffixes to list (which may contain
pattern characters that should be quoted from immediate interpretation
on the command line) may be given as additional arguments, otherwise
all suffixes are listed\&.
.PP
Calling \fBzsh\-mime\-setup\fP with the option
\fB\-v\fP causes verbose output to be shown during the setup operation\&.
.PP
The system respects the \fBmailcap\fP flags \fBneedsterminal\fP and
\fBcopiousoutput\fP, see \fImailcap\fP(4)\&.
.PP
The functions use the following styles, which are defined with the
\fBzstyle\fP builtin command (see \fIzshmodules\fP(1))\&.  They should be defined
before \fBzsh\-mime\-setup\fP is run\&.  The contexts used all
start with \fB:mime:\fP, with additional components in some cases\&.
It is recommended that a trailing \fB*\fP (suitably quoted) be appended
to style patterns in case the system is extended in future\&.  Some
examples are given below\&.
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBcurrent\-shell\fP
If this boolean style is true, the mailcap handler for the context in
question is run using the \fBeval\fP builtin instead of by starting a new
\fBsh\fP process\&.  This is more efficient, but may not work in the occasional
cases where the mailcap handler uses strict POSIX syntax\&.
.TP
\fBexecute\-as\-is\fP
This style gives a list of patterns to be matched against files
passed for execution with a handler program\&.  If the file matches
the pattern, the entire command line is executed in its current form,
with no handler\&.  This is useful for files which might have suffixes
but nonetheless be executable in their own right\&.  If the style
is not set, the pattern \fB*(*) *(/)\fP is used;
hence executable files are executed directly and not passed to a
handler, and the option \fBAUTO_CD\fP may be used to change to directories
that happen to have MIME suffixes\&.
.TP
\fBfile\-path\fP
Used if the style \fBfind\-file\-in\-path\fP is true for the same context\&.
Set to an array of directories that are used for searching for the
file to be handled; the default is the command path given by the
special parameter \fBpath\fP\&.  The shell option \fBPATH_DIRS\fP is respected;
if that is set, the appropriate path will be searched even if the
name of the file to be handled as it appears on the command line contains
a `\fB/\fP\&'\&.
The full context is \fB:mime:\&.\fP\fIsuffix\fP\fB:\fP, as described for the style
\fBhandler\fP\&.
.TP
\fBfind\-file\-in\-path\fP
If set, allows files whose names do not contain absolute paths
to be searched for in the command path or the path specified by the
\fBfile\-path\fP style\&.  If the file is not found in the path, it is looked
for locally (whether or not the current directory is in the path); if it is
not found locally, the handler will abort unless the \fBhandle\-nonexistent\fP
style is set\&.  Files found in the path are tested as described for
the style \fBexecute\-as\-is\fP\&.
The full context is \fB:mime:\&.\fP\fIsuffix\fP\fB:\fP, as described for the style
\fBhandler\fP\&.
.TP
\fBflags\fP
Defines flags to go with a handler; the context is as for the
\fBhandler\fP style, and the format is as for the flags in \fBmailcap\fP\&.
.TP
\fBhandle\-nonexistent\fP
By default, arguments that don\&'t correspond to files are not passed
to the MIME handler in order to prevent it from intercepting commands found
in the path that happen to have suffixes\&.  This style may be set to
an array of extended glob patterns for arguments that will be passed to the
handler even if they don\&'t exist\&.  If it is not explicitly set it
defaults to \fB[[:alpha:]]#:/*\fP which allows URLs to be passed to the MIME
handler even though they don\&'t exist in that format in the file system\&.
The full context is \fB:mime:\&.\fP\fIsuffix\fP\fB:\fP, as described for the style
\fBhandler\fP\&.
.TP
\fBhandler\fP
Specifies a handler for a suffix; the suffix is given by the context as
\fB:mime:\&.\fP\fIsuffix\fP\fB:\fP, and the format of the handler is exactly
that in \fBmailcap\fP\&.  Note in particular the `\fB\&.\fP\&' and trailing colon
to distinguish this use of the context\&.  This overrides any handler
specified by the \fBmailcap\fP files\&.  If the handler requires a terminal,
the \fBflags\fP style should be set to include the word \fBneedsterminal\fP,
or if the output is to be displayed through a pager (but not if the
handler is itself a pager), it should include \fBcopiousoutput\fP\&.
.TP
\fBmailcap\fP
A list of files in the format of \fB~/\&.mailcap\fP and
\fB/etc/mailcap\fP to be read during setup, replacing the default list
which consists of those two files\&.  The context is \fB:mime:\fP\&.
A \fB+\fP in the list will be replaced by the default files\&.

\fBmailcap\-priorities\fP
This style is used to resolve multiple mailcap entries for the same MIME
type\&.  It consists of an array of the following elements, in descending

It should be set to a list of patterns, each of which is tested against
the flags specified in the mailcap entry (in other words, the sets of

patterns in the list are preferred to later ones, and matched patterns
are preferred to unmatched ones\&.

\fBmime\-types\fP
A list of files in the format of \fB~/\&.mime\&.types\fP and

\fBnever\-background\fP

terminal)\&.
.TP
\fBpager\fP
If set, will be used instead of \fB$PAGER\fP or \fBmore\fP to handle
suffixes where the \fBcopiousoutput\fP flag is set\&.  The context is

\fB\&.\fP\fIext\fP does not have the expected effect\&.
.PP
The command `\fBalias \-s\fP \fIext\fP\&' should show
`\fBps=zsh\-mime\-handler\fP\&'\&.  If it shows something else, another suffix
alias was already installed and was not overwritten\&.  If it shows
nothing, no handler was installed:  this is most likely because no
handler was found in the \fB\&.mime\&.types\fP and \fBmailcap\fP combination for
\fB\&.ext\fP files\&.  In that case, appropriate handling should be added to
\fB~/\&.mime\&.types\fP and \fBmailcap\fP\&.
.PP
If the extension is handled by \fBzsh\-mime\-handler\fP but the file is
not opened correctly, either the handler defined for the type is
incorrect, or the flags associated with it are in appropriate\&.  Running
\fBzsh\-mime\-setup \-l\fP will show the handler and, if there are any, the
flags\&.  A \fB%s\fP in the handler is replaced by the file (suitably quoted
if necessary)\&.  Check that the handler program listed lists and can
be run in the way shown\&.  Also check that the flags \fBneedsterminal\fP or
\fBcopiousoutput\fP are set if the handler needs to be run under a

The \fBzsh/newuser\fP module comes with a function to aid in configuring
shell options for new users\&.  If the module is installed, this function can

\fBzsh\-newuser\-install\fP [ \fB\-f\fP ]
The function presents the user with various options for customizing
their initialization scripts\&.  Currently only \fB~/\&.zshrc\fP is handled\&.
\fB$ZDOTDIR/\&.zshrc\fP is used instead if the parameter \fBZDOTDIR\fP is
set; this provides a way for the user to configure a file without
altering an existing \fB\&.zshrc\fP\&.
.RS
.PP
By default the function exits immediately if it finds any of the files
\fB\&.zshenv\fP, \fB\&.zprofile\fP, \fB\&.zshrc\fP, or \fB\&.zlogin\fP in the appropriate
directory\&.  The option \fB\-f\fP is required in order to force the function
to continue\&.  Note this may happen even if \fB\&.zshrc\fP itself does not
exist\&.
.PP
As currently configured, the function will exit immediately if the
user has root privileges; this behaviour cannot be overridden\&.
.PP
Once activated, the function\&'s behaviour is supposed to be
self\-explanatory\&.  Menus are present allowing the user to alter
the value of options and parameters\&.  Suggestions for improvements are
always welcome\&.
.PP
When the script exits, the user is given the opportunity to save the new
file or not; changes are not irreversible until this point\&.  However,
the script is careful to restrict changes to the file only to a group
marked by the lines `\fB# Lines configured by zsh\-newuser\-install\fP\&' and
`\fB# End of lines configured by zsh\-newuser\-install\fP\&'\&.  In addition,
the old version of \fB\&.zshrc\fP is saved to a file with the suffix
\fB\&.zni\fP appended\&.
.PP
If the function edits an existing \fB\&.zshrc\fP, it is up to the user
to ensure that the changes made will take effect\&.  For example, if
control usually returns early from the existing \fB\&.zshrc\fP the lines
will not be executed; or a later initialization file may override
options or parameters, and so on\&.  The function itself does not attempt to
detect any such conflicts\&.

This function works like GNU xargs, except that instead of reading lines
of arguments from the standard input, it takes them from the command line\&.
This is useful because zsh, especially with recursive glob operators,
often can construct a command line for a shell function that is longer
than can be accepted by an external command\&.
.RS
.PP
The \fIoption\fP list represents options of the \fBzargs\fP command itself,
which are the same as those of \fBxargs\fP\&.  The \fIinput\fP list is the
collection of strings (often file names) that become the arguments of the
\fBcommand\fP, analogous to the standard input of \fBxargs\fP\&.  Finally, the
\fIarg\fP list consists of those arguments (usually options) that are
passed to the \fIcommand\fP each time it runs\&.  The \fIarg\fP list precedes
the elements from the \fBinput\fP list in each run\&.  If no \fIcommand\fP is
provided, then no \fIarg\fP list may be provided, and in that event the
default command is `\fBprint\fP\&' with arguments `\fB\-r \-\fP\fB\-\fP'\&.
.PP
For example, to get a long \fBls\fP listing of all plain files in the
current directory or its subdirectories:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBautoload \-U zargs
zargs \-\- **/*(\&.) \-\- ls \-l\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' is used both to mark the end of the \fIoption\fP
list and to mark the end of the \fIinput\fP list, so it must appear twice
whenever the \fIinput\fP list may be empty\&.  If there is guaranteed to be
at least one \fIinput\fP and the first \fIinput\fP does not begin with a
`\fB\-\fP\&', then the first `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP' may be omitted\&.
.PP
In the event that the string `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' is or may be an \fIinput\fP, the
\fB\-e\fP option may be used to change the end\-of\-inputs marker\&.  Note that
this does \fInot\fP change the end\-of\-options marker\&.  For example, to use
`\fB\&.\&.\fP\&' as the marker:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzargs \-e\&.\&. \-\- **/*(\&.) \&.\&. ls \-l\fP

This is a good choice in that example because no plain file can be named

.RS
.PP
Only one \fIname\fP argument is allowed\&.
If the \fB\-f\fP option is given, the name is taken to be that of
a function; if the function is marked for autoloading, \fBzed\fP searches
for it in the \fBfpath\fP and loads it\&.  Note that functions edited this way
are installed into the current shell, but \fInot\fP written back to the
autoload file\&.
.PP
Without \fB\-f\fP, \fIname\fP is the path name of the file to edit, which need
not exist; it is created on write, if necessary\&.
.PP
While editing, the function sets the main keymap to \fBzed\fP and the
vi command keymap to \fBzed\-vicmd\fP\&.  These will be copied from the existing
\fBmain\fP and \fBvicmd\fP keymaps if they do not exist the first time \fBzed\fP
is run\&.  They can be used to provide special key bindings used only in zed\&.
.PP
If it creates the keymap, \fBzed\fP rebinds the return key to insert a line
break and `\fB^X^W\fP\&' to accept the edit in the \fBzed\fP keymap, and binds
`\fBZZ\fP\&' to accept the edit in the \fBzed\-vicmd\fP keymap\&.
.PP
The bindings alone can be installed by running `\fBzed \-b\fP\&'\&.  This is
suitable for putting into a startup file\&.  Note that, if rerun,
this will overwrite the existing \fBzed\fP and \fBzed\-vicmd\fP keymaps\&.
.PP
Completion is available, and styles may be set with the context prefix
`\fB:completion:zed\fP\&'\&.
.PP
A zle widget \fBzed\-set\-file\-name\fP is available\&.  This can be called by
name from within zed using `\fB\eex zed\-set\-file\-name\fP\&' (note, however, that
because of zed\&'s rebindings you will have to type \fB^j\fP at the end instead
of the return key), or can be bound to a key in either of the \fBzed\fP or
\fBzed\-vicmd\fP keymaps after `\fBzed \-b\fP\&' has been run\&.  When the widget is
called, it prompts for a new name for the file being edited\&.  When zed
exits the file will be written under that name and the original file will
be left alone\&.  The widget has no effect with `\fBzed \-f\fP\&'\&.
.PP
While \fBzed\-set\-file\-name\fP is running, zed uses the keymap
\fBzed\-normal\-keymap\fP, which is linked from the main keymap in effect
at the time zed initialised its bindings\&.  (This is to make the return key
operate normally\&.)  The result is that if the main keymap has been changed,
the widget won\&'t notice\&.  This is not a concern for most users\&.
