exit [ n ]
       Exit the shell with the exit status specified by n; if  none  is
       specified,  use  the exit status from the last command executed.
       An EOF condition will also cause the shell to exit,  unless  the
       IGNORE EOF option is set.

       See  notes  at  the end of the section JOBS in in zshmisc(1) for
       some possibly unexpected interactions of the exit  command  with
       jobs.

bye    Same as exit.

logout [ n ]
       Same as exit, except that it only works in a login shell.
