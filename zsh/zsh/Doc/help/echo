echo [ -neE ] [ arg ... ]
       Write each arg on the standard output, with a  space  separating
       each one.  If the -n flag is not present, print a newline at the
       end.  echo recognizes the following escape sequences:

       \a     bell character
       \b     backspace
       \c     suppress final newline
       \e     escape
       \f     form feed
       \n     linefeed (newline)
       \r     carriage return
       \t     horizontal tab
       \v     vertical tab
       \\     backslash
       \0NNN  character code in octal
       \xNN   character code in hexadecimal
       \uNNNN unicode character code in hexadecimal
       \UNNNNNNNN
              unicode character code in hexadecimal

       The -E flag, or the BSD ECHO option,  can  be  used  to  disable
                              -
       these escape sequences.  In the latter case, -e flag can be used
       to enable them.
