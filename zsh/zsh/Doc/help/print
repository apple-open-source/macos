print [ -abcDilmnNoOpPrsSz ] [ -u n ] [ -f format ] [ -C cols ]
  [ -R [ -en ]] [ arg ... ]
       With the `-f' option the arguments are printed as  described  by
       printf.   With  no flags or with the flag `-', the arguments are
       printed on the standard output as described by  echo,  with  the
       following  differences:  the escape sequence `\M-x' metafies the
       character x (sets the highest bit), `\C-x'  produces  a  control
       character  (`\C-@'  and  `\C-?'  give  the  characters  NUL  and
       delete), and `\E' is a synonym for `\e'.  Finally, if not in  an
       escape  sequence, `\' escapes the following character and is not
       printed.

       -a     Print arguments with the column incrementing first.  Only
              useful with the -c and -C options.

       -b     Recognize  all the escape sequences defined for the bind-
              key command, see zshzle(1).

       -c     Print the arguments in columns.  Unless -a is also given,
              arguments are printed with the row incrementing first.

       -C cols
              Print  the  arguments in cols columns.  Unless -a is also
              given, arguments are printed with  the  row  incrementing
              first.

       -D     Treat  the  arguments  as paths, replacing directory pre-
              fixes  with  ~  expressions  corresponding  to  directory
              names, as appropriate.

       -i     If  given  together  with  -o or -O, sorting is performed
              case-independently.

       -l     Print the arguments separated by newlines instead of spa-
              ces.

       -m     Take  the first argument as a pattern (should be quoted),
              and remove it from the argument list together with subse-
              quent arguments that do not match this pattern.

       -n     Do not add a newline to the output.

       -N     Print the arguments separated and terminated by nulls.

       -o     Print the arguments sorted in ascending order.

       -O     Print the arguments sorted in descending order.

       -p     Print the arguments to the input of the coprocess.

       -P     Perform   prompt   expansion  (see  EXPANSION  OF  PROMPT
              SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1)).

       -r     Ignore the escape conventions of echo.

       -R     Emulate the BSD echo  command,  which  does  not  process
              escape  sequences  unless  the  -e flag is given.  The -n
              flag suppresses the trailing newline.  Only the -e and -n
              flags  are  recognized  after -R; all other arguments and
              options are printed.

       -s     Place the results in the history list instead of  on  the
              standard  output.   Each argument to the print command is
              treated as a single word in the  history,  regardless  of
              its content.

       -S     Place  the  results in the history list instead of on the
              standard output.  In this case only a single argument  is
              allowed; it will be split into words as if it were a full
              shell command line.  The effect is similar to reading the
              line  from  a history file with the HIST LEX WORDS option
                                                      -   -
              active.

       -u n   Print the arguments to file descriptor n.

       -z     Push the arguments onto the editing buffer  stack,  sepa-
              rated by spaces.

       If  any  of `-m', `-o' or `-O' are used in combination with `-f'
       and there are no arguments (after the  removal  process  in  the
       case of `-m') then nothing is printed.

pushln [ arg ... ]
       Equivalent to print -nz.
