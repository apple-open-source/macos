jobs [ -dlprs ] [ job ... ]
jobs -Z string
       Lists  information  about  each given job, or all jobs if job is
       omitted.  The -l flag lists process IDs, and the -p  flag  lists
       process  groups.   If the -r flag is specified only running jobs
       will be listed and if the -s flag is given only stopped jobs are
       shown.   If  the  -d flag is given, the directory from which the
       job was started (which may not be the current directory  of  the
       job) will also be shown.

       The  -Z  option  replaces  the  shell's argument and environment
       space with the given string,  truncated  if  necessary  to  fit.
       This will normally be visible in ps (ps(1)) listings.  This fea-
       ture is typically used by daemons, to indicate their state.
