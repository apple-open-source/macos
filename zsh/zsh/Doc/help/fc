       Select a range of commands from first to last from  the  history
       list.  The arguments first and last may be specified as a number
       or as a string.  A negative number is used as an offset  to  the
       current  history  event  number.   A  string  specifies the most
       recent event beginning with the given string.  All substitutions
       old=new, if any, are then performed on the commands.

       If  the  -l  flag is given, the resulting commands are listed on
       standard output.  If the -m flag is also given the  first  argu-
       ment  is taken as a pattern (should be quoted) and only the his-
       tory events matching this pattern will be shown.  Otherwise  the
       editor  program ename is invoked on a file containing these his-
       tory events.  If ename is not given, the value of the  parameter
       FCEDIT  is  used;  if that is not set the value of the parameter
       EDITOR is used; if that is not set a  builtin  default,  usually
       `vi'  is  used.   If  ename  is `-', no editor is invoked.  When
       editing is complete, the edited command is executed.

       If first is not specified, it will be set to -1 (the most recent
       event), or to -16 if the -l flag is given.  If last is not spec-
       ified, it will be set to first, or to  -1  if  the  -l  flag  is
       given.

       The  flag  -r reverses the order of the commands and the flag -n
       suppresses command numbers when listing.

       Also when listing,
       -d     prints timestamps for each command
       -f     prints full time-date stamps in the US  `MM/DD/YY  hh:mm'
              format
       -E     prints  full time-date stamps in the European `dd.mm.yyyy
              hh:mm' format
       -i     prints  full  time-date  stamps  in  ISO8601  `yyyy-mm-dd
              hh:mm' format
       -t fmt prints  time  and date stamps in the given format; fmt is
              formatted with the strftime function with the zsh  exten-
              sions  described  for the %D{string} prompt format in the
              section EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1).  The
              resulting formatted string must be no more than 256 char-
              acters or will not be printed.
       -D     prints elapsed times; may be combined  with  one  of  the
              options above.

       `fc  -p'  pushes  the  current  history  list  onto  a stack and
       switches to a new history list.  If the -a option is also speci-
       fied,  this  history  list will be automatically popped when the
       current function scope is exited, which is a much  better  solu-
       tion than creating a trap function to call `fc -P' manually.  If
       no arguments are specified, the  history  list  is  left  empty,
       $HISTFILE  is  unset, and $HISTSIZE & $SAVEHIST are set to their
       default values.  If one argument is given, $HISTFILE is  set  to
       that filename, $HISTSIZE & $SAVEHIST are left unchanged, and the
       history file is read in (if it exists)  to  initialize  the  new
       list.   If a second argument is specified, $HISTSIZE & $SAVEHIST
       are instead set to the single specified numeric value.  Finally,
       if a third argument is specified, $SAVEHIST is set to a separate
       value from $HISTSIZE.  You are free to change these  environment
       values  for  the new history list however you desire in order to
       manipulate the new history list.

       `fc -P' pops the history list back to an older list saved by `fc
       -p'.   The  current  list is saved to its $HISTFILE before it is
       destroyed (assuming that $HISTFILE and $SAVEHIST are set  appro-
       priately,  of  course).  The values of $HISTFILE, $HISTSIZE, and
       $SAVEHIST are restored to the values they had when `fc  -p'  was
       called.   Note  that  this  restoration can conflict with making
       these variables "local", so your best bet is to avoid local dec-
       larations  for  these  variables  in functions that use `fc -p'.
       The one other guaranteed-safe  combination  is  declaring  these
       variables  to be local at the top of your function and using the
       automatic option (-a) with `fc -p'.  Finally, note  that  it  is
       legal to manually pop a push marked for automatic popping if you
       need to do so before the function exits.

       `fc -R' reads the history from the given file,  `fc  -W'  writes
       the  history out to the given file, and `fc -A' appends the his-
       tory out to the given file.  If no filename  is  specified,  the
       $HISTFILE  is  assumed.   If  the -I option is added to -R, only
       those events that are not already contained within the  internal
       history  list are added.  If the -I option is added to -A or -W,
       only  those  events  that  are  new   since   last   incremental
       append/write  to  the history file are appended/written.  In any
       case, the created file will have no more than $SAVEHIST entries.
