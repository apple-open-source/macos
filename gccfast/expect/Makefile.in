# Flags to pass to both cc and ld
# You should be able to leave this just the way it is.  However, here are some
# note if you run into problems:
#
# Avoid -O (optimize) unless you are convinced your optimizer is flawless
# (hint: not a chance).  I have heard many reports of -O causing Expect to
# misbehave.
# I encourage you to use -g (debugging).  While it is unlikely you will
# encounter an internal error in Expect, should this happen, I may just need
# the -g information and then you will need to recompile Expect.  As an aside,
# Expect is not a space or time pig, so this won't affect the performance of
# your Expect scripts.
# Note: On Linux systems which only have dynamic X libraries, the -g prevents
# the linker from using them.  So do not use -g on such systems.
# From now on, CFLAGS is never used.  Instead, use XCFLAGS.  This is done so
# that we can provide a public interface for CFLAGS thereby allowing users
# to add to it on the Make command-line and still get the rest of the flags
# computed by configure.  Do this at your own risk - it obvious goes against
# the idea of configure's interface, however this is established tradition
