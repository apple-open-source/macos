<p align=center><b>Clock Skew</b></p>
<p>Since master leases take into account a timeout that is used across
all sites in a replication group, leases must also take into account
any known skew (or drift) between the clocks on different machines
in the group.  The guarantees provided by master leases take clock
skew into account.  Consider a replication group where a client's
clock is running faster than the master's clock and the group has
a lease timeout of 5 seconds.  If clock skew is not taken into
account, eventually, the client will believe that 5 seconds have
passed faster than the master and that client may then grant its
lease to another site.  Meanwhile, the master site does not believe
5 seconds have passed because its clock is slower, and it believes
it still holds a valid lease grant.  For this reason, Berkeley DB compensates
for clock skew.</p>
<p>The master of a group using leases must account for skew
in case that site has the slowest clock in the group.  This computation
avoids the problem of a master site believing a lease grant is valid
too long.  Clients in a group must account for skew in case they
have the fastest clock in the group.  This computation avoids
the problem of a client site expiring its grant too soon and
potentially granting a lease to a different site.  Berkeley DB uses
a conservative computation and accounts for clock skew on both
sides, yielding a double compensation.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../api_c/rep_clockskew.html">DB_ENV-&gt;rep_set_clockskew</a> method takes the values for both the fastest
and slowest clocks in the entire replication group as parameters.
The values passed in must be the same for all sites in the group.
If the user knows the maximum clock drift of their sites, then those
values can be expressed as a relative percentage.  Or, if the user
runs an experiment then the actual values can be used.</p>
<p>For example, suppose the user knows that there is a maximum drift
rate of 2% among sites in the group.  The user should pass in
102 and 100 for the fast and slow clock values respectively.
That is an unusually large value, so suppose, for example, the
rate is 0.03% among sites in the group.  The user should pass in
10003 and 10000 for the fast and slow clock values.  Those values
can be used to express the level of precision the user needs.</p>
<p>An example of an experiment a user can run to help determine skew
would be to write a program that started simultaneously on all
sites in the group.  Suppose, after 1 day (86400 seconds), one
site shows 86400 seconds and the other site shows it ran faster
and it indicates 86460 seconds has passed.
The user can use 86460 and 86400 for their parameters for the
fast and slow clock values.</p>
<p>Since Berkeley DB is using those fast and slow clock values to compute
a ratio internally, if the user cannot detect or measure any
clock skew, then the same value should be passed in for both
parameters, such as 1 and 1.</p>
