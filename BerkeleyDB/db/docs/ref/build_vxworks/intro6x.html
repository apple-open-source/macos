<b>Building With Wind River Workbench using the Makefile</b>
<p>In VxWorks6.x, developers use Wind River Workbench for software
development. Two makefiles are provided in the db/build_vxworks
directory. Use them to build Berkeley DB or Berkeley DB small build, using 
the build chain provided with Wind River Workbench. </p>
<p>We assume that you have installed all necessary VxWorks6.x software 
including the Wind River Workbench, and that you know how to use it. </p>
<p>Use the following steps to build Berkeley DB: </p>
<p>1. Setting variables in the Makefile.
Open the Makefile and modify the BDB_ROOT variable to the path of your
Berkeley DB source tree's root directory. You may need to set other
variables when you build on different platforms, such as BUILD_SPEC,
DEBUG_MODE, PROJECT_TYPE, build tool flags and BUILD_SPEC specific settings.
Please refer to the documentation of the Workbench for a complete list of
available values of each variable. You can also find out the list of values
by creating a project using the Workbench. Each variable's available values 
will be listed in the GUI window which assigns values to that
variable. </p>
<p>2. Make sure "make" can be found.
Basically you need to set the make utility's path to environment variables.
</p>
<p>3. Start up the wrenv utility of the Wind River Workbench. </p>
<p>4. In the command console, move to the $(BDB_ROOT)/build_vxworks/ directory,
rename the target makefile (Makefile.6x or Makefile.6x.small) to "Makefile",
and run "make".  The make process will start and create the directory 
"bdbvxw". It will contain all intermediate object files as well as the
final built image "bdbvxw.out". </p>
<p>5. After the "bdbvxw.out" image is built, you can use command tools
or the Workbench IDE to download and run it.</p>
<p>6. Test and Verification.
There is a dbdemo and test_micro, which you can run to verify whether
everything works fine.</p>
