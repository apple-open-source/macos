<b>Description: DBcursor-&gt;put</b>
<p>The DBcursor-&gt;put method stores key/data pairs into the database.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, the DBcursor-&gt;put method
returns a non-zero error value on failure
and 0 on success.
</p>
<p>If DBcursor-&gt;put fails for any reason, the state of the cursor will be
unchanged.  If DBcursor-&gt;put succeeds and an item is inserted into the
database, the cursor is always positioned to refer to the newly inserted
item.</p>
<b>Parameters</b> <br>
 <b>data</b><ul compact><li>The data <a href="../api_c/dbt_class.html">DBT</a> operated on.</ul>
 <b>flags</b><ul compact><li>The <b>flags</b> parameter must be set to one of the following values:
<br>
<b><a name="DB_AFTER">DB_AFTER</a></b><ul compact><li>In the case of the Btree and Hash access methods, insert the data
element as a duplicate element of the key to which the cursor refers.
The new element appears immediately after the current cursor position.
It is an error to specify DB_AFTER if the underlying Btree or
Hash database is not configured for unsorted duplicate data items.  The
<b>key</b> parameter is ignored.
<p>In the case of the Recno access method, it is an error to specify
DB_AFTER if the underlying Recno database was not created with
the <a href="../api_c/db_set_flags.html#DB_RENUMBER">DB_RENUMBER</a> flag.  If the <a href="../api_c/db_set_flags.html#DB_RENUMBER">DB_RENUMBER</a> flag was
specified, a new key is created, all records after the inserted item
are automatically renumbered, and the key of the new record is returned
in the structure to which the <b>key</b> parameter refers.  The initial
value of the <b>key</b> parameter is ignored.  See <a href="../api_c/db_open.html">DB-&gt;open</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>The DB_AFTER flag may not be specified to the Queue access method.</p>
<p>The DBcursor-&gt;put method will return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_NOTFOUND">DB_NOTFOUND</a> if the current cursor record has already been deleted and the
underlying access method is Hash.
</p></ul>
<b><a name="DB_BEFORE">DB_BEFORE</a></b><ul compact><li>In the case of the Btree and Hash access methods, insert the data
element as a duplicate element of the key to which the cursor refers.
The new element appears immediately before the current cursor position.
It is an error to specify DB_AFTER if the underlying Btree or
Hash database is not configured for unsorted duplicate data items.  The
<b>key</b> parameter is ignored.
<p>In the case of the Recno access method, it is an error to specify
DB_BEFORE if the underlying Recno database was not created with
the <a href="../api_c/db_set_flags.html#DB_RENUMBER">DB_RENUMBER</a> flag.  If the <a href="../api_c/db_set_flags.html#DB_RENUMBER">DB_RENUMBER</a> flag was
specified, a new key is created, the current record and all records
after it are automatically renumbered, and the key of the new record is
returned in the structure to which the <b>key</b> parameter refers.
The initial value of the <b>key</b> parameter is ignored.  See
<a href="../api_c/db_open.html">DB-&gt;open</a> for more information.</p>
<p>The DB_BEFORE flag may not be specified to the Queue access method.</p>
<p>The DBcursor-&gt;put method will return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_NOTFOUND">DB_NOTFOUND</a> if the current cursor record has already been deleted and the underlying
access method is Hash.
</p></ul>
<b><a name="DB_CURRENT">DB_CURRENT</a></b><ul compact><li>Overwrite the data of the key/data pair to which the cursor refers with
the specified data item.  The <b>key</b> parameter is ignored.
<p>The DBcursor-&gt;put method will return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_NOTFOUND">DB_NOTFOUND</a> if the current cursor record has already been deleted.
</p></ul>
<b><a name="DB_KEYFIRST">DB_KEYFIRST</a></b><ul compact><li>Insert the specified key/data pair into the database.
<p>If the underlying database supports duplicate data items, and if the
key already exists in the database and a duplicate sort function has
been specified, the inserted data item is added in its sorted location.
If the key already exists in the database and no duplicate sort function
has been specified, the inserted data item is added as the first of the
data items for that key.</p></ul>
<b><a name="DB_KEYLAST">DB_KEYLAST</a></b><ul compact><li>Insert the specified key/data pair into the database.
<p>If the underlying database supports duplicate data items, and if the
key already exists in the database and a duplicate sort function has
been specified, the inserted data item is added in its sorted location.
If the key already exists in the database, and no duplicate sort
function has been specified, the inserted data item is added as the last
of the data items for that key.</p></ul>
<b><a name="DB_NODUPDATA">DB_NODUPDATA</a></b><ul compact><li>In the case of the Btree and Hash access methods, insert the specified
key/data pair into the database, unless a key/data pair comparing
equally to it already exists in the database.  If a matching key/data
pair already exists in the database, <a href="../api_c/dbc_put.html#DB_KEYEXIST">DB_KEYEXIST</a> is returned.
The DB_NODUPDATA flag may only be specified if the underlying
database has been configured to support sorted duplicate data items.
<p>The DB_NODUPDATA flag may not be specified to the Queue or Recno
access methods.</p></ul>
<br></ul>
 <b>key</b><ul compact><li>The key <a href="../api_c/dbt_class.html">DBT</a> operated on.</ul>
<br>
<br><b>Errors</b>
<p>The DBcursor-&gt;put method
may fail and return one of the following non-zero errors:</p>
<br>
<b>DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK</b><ul compact><li>A transactional database environment operation was selected to resolve
a deadlock.</ul>
<b>DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED</b><ul compact><li>A Berkeley DB Concurrent Data Store database environment configured for lock timeouts was unable
to grant a lock in the allowed time.</ul>
<br>
<br>
<b>DB_REP_HANDLE_DEAD</b><ul compact><li>The database handle has been invalidated because a replication election
unrolled a committed transaction.</ul>
<br>
<br>
<b>DB_REP_LOCKOUT</b><ul compact><li>The operation was blocked by client/master synchronization.</ul>
<br>
<br>
<b>EACCES</b><ul compact><li>An attempt was made to modify a read-only database.</ul>
<br>
<br>
<b>EINVAL</b><ul compact><li>If the DB_AFTER, DB_BEFORE or DB_CURRENT flags
were specified and the cursor has not been initialized;
the DB_AFTER or DB_BEFORE flags were specified and a
duplicate sort function has been specified;
the DB_CURRENT flag was specified, a duplicate sort function has
been specified, and the data item of the referenced key/data pair does
not compare equally to the <b>data</b> parameter;
the DB_AFTER or DB_BEFORE flags were specified, and the
underlying access method is Queue;
an attempt was made to add a record to a fixed-length database that was too
large to fit;
an attempt was made to add a record to a secondary index; or if an
invalid flag value or parameter was specified.</ul>
<br>
<br>
<b>EPERM  </b><ul compact><li>Write attempted on read-only cursor when the <a href="../api_c/env_open.html#DB_INIT_CDB">DB_INIT_CDB</a> flag was
specified to <a href="../api_c/env_open.html">DB_ENV-&gt;open</a>.</ul>
