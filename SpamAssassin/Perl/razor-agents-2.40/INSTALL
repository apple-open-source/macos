                         Vipul's Razor v2     
                    Installation Instructions 

1. Download the latest v2 razor-agents tarball from
   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3978

2. Download the latest v2 razor-agents-sdk tarball from
   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3978
   Untar and run:
            
            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

If you are not root, run perl Makefile.PL with a "PREFIX=~"
option, like so:
    
            perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~

                        OR 

2. Instead of installing the razor-agents-sdk package, you can install the
   following Perl modules from CPAN:

            Net::Ping
            Net::DNS
            Time::HiRes
            Digest::SHA1
            Getopt::Long
            File::Copy
            Digest::Nilsimsa
            URI::Escape

If you do not install perl libs to standard places, set PERL5LIB.  csh ex:

            setenv PERL5LIB /home/user/myperl/lib

3. Untar the razor-agents tarball and run: 

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install
      
4. Razor Agents are now installed. Run `razor-client' after installation
   to insure appropriate symlinks have been created. 

5. Run `razor-admin -create' to create a default config file in your
   home directory under /home/user/.razor. (Remember to change user to
   your username from root before running razor-admin)

6. Razor v2 requires reporters to be registered so their reputations can
   be computed over time and they can participate in the revocation
   mechanism. Registration is done with razor-admin -register. It has to be
   manually invoked in either of the following ways:

    To register user foo with `s1kret' as password: 

            razor-admin -register -user=foo -pass=s1kr3t 

    To register with an email address and have the password assigned:

            razor-admin -register -user=foo@bar.com      

    To have both (random) username and password assgined: 

            razor-admin -register 
      
    razor-admin -register negotiates a registration with the Nomination Server
    and writes the identity information in
    /home/user/.razor/identity-username, or /etc/razor/identity-username
    when invoked as root.

7. You can edit razor-agent.conf to change the defaults. Config options
   and their values are defined in the razor-agent.conf(5) manpage.
       
8. The next step is to integrate razor-check, razor-report and
   razor-revoke in your mail system. If you are running Razor v1, the
   change will be transparent, new versions of razor agents will overwrite
   the old ones. You would still need to plugin razor-revoke in your MUA,
   since it's a new addition in Razor v2. If you are not running Razor v1,
   refer to manpages of razor-check(1), razor-report(1), and
   razor-revoke(1) for integration instructions.
