Revision history for Perl extension Convert::UUlib.

1.03 Sun Apr 18 22:05:43 CEST 2004
	- upgrade to uudeview-0.5.20, which supposedly fixes a few buffer
          overflows. However, judging from the patch these vulnerabilities
          were not present in the Convert-UUlib version (I might err, though,
          documentation on the actual exploits is scarce).
          As every uudeview update usually brings more instability than stability
          I advise against using this version until it has proven itself
          to be stable, or 1.02 is proven to contain the same buffer overflows.

1.02 Sun Apr 18 16:47:26 CEST 2004
        - renamed crc32 to uulib_crc32, to work around yet another
          shortcoming in this oh-so-outdated macosx.

1.01 Sun Feb  1 19:49:51 CET 2004
	- make it compile with 5.005_03 (reported by Anton Berezin).
        - very short files might not be detected because the header
          parsing code might skip them.

1.0  Thu Nov  6 14:32:08 CET 2003
	- change bracket policy to give priority to (x/y) over (x),
          and use the last bracket found otherwise.
        - part numbers at the end of the subject are now recognized.
        - updated to uulib-0.5.19. Differences and bugfixes kept.

0.31 Wed Oct 16 01:22:34 CEST 2002
	- no internal code changes.
	- much better documentation, now considered "useful".
        - removed the procedural interface.
        - fought the wish to perl-5.8'ify and thus simplify the code :().
        - stress-tested version 0.3 against 70000 data postings since sunday.

0.3   Sun Oct 13 15:12:11 CEST 2002
	- updated to uulib 0.5.18. As expected, some but not all of my bugfixes
          have went into uulib, so the number of differences decreased a bit
          again.
        - I found out that the library is being sold commercially by Frank
          Pilhofer, disregarding the GPL and ignoring the rights of the people
          who sent in patches :(
        - vastly more useful documentation in the .pm file.
        - much smaller distribution filesize ;)

0.213 Sat Jul 27 21:16:30 CEST 2002
	- fixed another buffer overflow, also added a santity check to fgets.

0.212 Sat Apr  6 03:52:13 CEST 2002
        - fix yEnc decoding support.
        - new option OPT_DOTDOT, that makes uulib unescape dot-escaping.
        - increased linelength to 1195.

0.211 Fri Apr  5 23:56:46 CEST 2002
	- *sigh*. new version of uulib, new braindamaged buffer overflows
          fixed. Diffs like "line length 256 => 300" should have
          alerted me...

0.21  Sun Mar 31 22:06:05 CEST 2002
	- bumped uulib from 0.5.15 to 0.5.17 (adds some yEnc support, YENC_ENCODED).
        - source-renamed FP_*-symbols to _FP_* again, but still define them
          to be FP_* in the object file.
        - new callback: SetFileNameCallback (actually documented ;)

0.201 Sun Sep 16 03:43:38 CEST 2001
	- fixed another segfault-bug in uulib, thanks to Lars Hecking who
          provides all the test files ;)

0.2  Thu Jun 14 18:42:49 CEST 2001
        - Frank Pilhofer is NOT dead! He is alive, kicking, and fixing
          bugs in uulib now! Since his uulib and mine diverged quite
          a bit I am still in the process of merging his bugfixes
          into my version. So be aware that this might introduce new
          instabilities...
        - merged uulib-0.5.15
        - optimize decode_file to not copy the file contents when a rename
          succeeds (TMPDIR same disk as destination).
        - updated documentation.

0.111 Fri May  4 22:29:09 CEST 2001
        - heuristic to decode microsoft-rfc822-headers (microsoft uses
          '\' as path seperator which is also the rfc822 quote character.
          of course they could have quoted it, but it's microsoft, so
          only the devil knows how they try to parse mime (they obviously
          haven't read the standard AGAIN). in case you wonder, this fixes
          the "c:my_documentssend.doc" "filename" problem.

0.11  Sun Jul 16 22:42:57 CEST 2000
	- fixed a bug in the file callback.

0.10  Tue May  2 03:31:09 CEST 2000
        - fixed one very longstanding bug that might have been the cause
          for the many mysterious segmentation faults. Hopefully.
        - improved documentation to the point that it slowly becomes useful
          as a (very quick) reference.

0.07  Wed Nov 24 18:45:23 CET 1999
	- removed END { CleanUp } from UUlib.pm, perl is too
          buggy to rely on this in the face of popen etc..

0.06  Thu Jul 29 22:48:18 CEST 1999
	- Thierry Bezecourt had the very reasonable idea to include
          the example source in the manpage.

0.05  Mon May 24 11:37:25 CEST 1999
	- LoadFile returns number of parts loaded.

0.04  Mon May 10 22:02:31 CEST 1999
	- fixed a couple of portability problems.
        - UUEncodeToStream had a wrong definition.
        - added primitive testsuite.
        - added README.

0.03  Sat May  8 22:40:01 CEST 1999
	- renamed it to Convert::UUlib.

0.02  Fri May  7 01:26:19 CEST 1999
	- function names exportable (use :all-tag).
	- made uulist-related functions methods.
        - the first fix from cpan-tester. *sigh* you people save the
          world, continuously.

0.01  Thu May  6 14:30:44 1999
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19
