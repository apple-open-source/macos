2004-01-02   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

2003-11-30   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.28

   The query_param_delete() method was not able to delete
   the last parameter from a form.  Similar problem existing
   when deleting via query_param().  Patch by <awk@awks.org>.

   The query_form() method now allow an array or hash
   reference to be passed to set the value.  This makes it
   possible to set the value to an empty form, something that
   the old API did not allow.

   The query_keywords() method now allow an array reference
   to be passed to set the value.



2003-10-06   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.27

   The URI module is now less strict about the values accepted

2003-08-18   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.25

   Allow literal '@' in userinfo.  If there are multiple '@' chars
   in the 'authority' component use the last (instead of first) as
   the 'userinfo' delimiter.

   Make URI->query_form escape '[' and ']'.  These chars where added
   to the reserved set in RFC 2732.  This also match MSIE behaviour.

   Silience warning from 'sip' support class.



2003-07-24   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.24

   Relative URIs that start with the query string directly (i.e. "?q")
   are now absolutized as specified in rfc2396bis.  See:
   http://www.apache.org/~fielding/uri/rev-2002/issues.html#003-relative-query
   
   Added URI::Split module.  It's a lightweight module that can be
   used to parse and compose URI string to/from its component parts.

   The rel() method will now work from canonical URIs.  That allow it
   to extract a relative URI in more cases.



2003-01-01   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Patch by Ville Skyttä <ville.skytta@iki.fi>.



2002-05-09   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.19

   URI::Heuristic will guess better on strings
   like "123.3.3.3:8080/foo".  It used to think that
   the numbers before ":" was a scheme.

   URI::WithBase will not keep the full history of
   any base URI's base URI etc.  This used to make
   these objects grow into to monsters for some
   web spiders.

   URI::URL->new("foo", "bar")->base used to return
   a "URI" object.  Now an URI::URL object is returned
   instead.

   Deal properly with file:///-URIs.



2001-12-30   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.18

   Added support for ssh: URIs.
   Contributed by Jean-Philippe Bouchard <jeanphil@sitepak.com>

   Don't try to come up with the e-mail address of the user as
   the anonymous password.
   Patch by Eduardo Pérez <eperez@dei.inf.uc3m.es>.



2001-09-14   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Fixed unescape of %30 in $http_uri->canonical.

   Fixed test failure for t/heuristic.t on cygwin.

   Fixed warning noise from t/old-base.t on bleadperl.
   Perl now warns for pack("c*", $i) when $i > 127.



2001-08-27   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.16

   URI::Escape::uri_escape default has changed.  Reserved
   characters are now escaped when no second argument is
   provided.

   The perl5.004 backwards compatibility patching taking place
   in the Makefile.PL should now work for MacPerl.
   Patch by KIMURA Takeshi <kim@ga2.so-net.ne.jp>.

   URI::WithBase now overrides the can() method and delegate it to
   the URI member.  This also affects the URI::URL behaviour.
   Patch by Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>.



2001-07-19   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.15

   [This release was made just to document the changes that went
    into the (unreleased) URI-1.13 but never made it into this
    change-log.  There is no functional difference between the 1.14
    and 1.15 release.]



2001-07-18   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.14

   The module failed on perl5.004 because \z is not supported
   in regexps.  The Makefile.PL will now try to patch the module
   to be compatible.



2001-05-15   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.13 (never made it to CPAN)

   URI.pm now conforms to RFC 2732 which specify how literal IPv6
   addresses are to be included in URLs.

   URI/Escape now allows "/" in the $unsafe pattern argument.



2001-04-23   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.12

   URI->new($u, $scheme) does no longer fail if given a badly
   formatted scheme string.

   URI::WithBase's clone and base method was basically just
   broken.  This also affected the URI::URL subclass.
   The clone() method did not copy the base, and updating
   the base with the base method always set it to "1".



2001-02-27   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.11

   The t/heuristic.t test relied on the fact that 'www.perl.no'
   was not registered in DNS.  This is no longer true.
   The penguins at Bouvet Island will hopefully be ignorant
   of Perl forever.



2001-01-10   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.10

   The $u->query_form method will now escape spaces in
   form keys or values as '+' (instead of '%20').  This also
   affect the $mailto_uri->header() method.  This is actually
   the wrong thing to do, but this practise is now even
   documented in official places like
   http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1
   so we might as well follow the stream.

   URI::Heuristic did not work for domain-names with dashes '-'
   in them.  Fixed.

   Documented that $uri->xxx($1) might not work.



2000-08-16   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.09

   uri_unescape() did not work when given multiple strings
   to decode.  Patch by Nicholas Clark <nick@ccl4.org>.

   Release 1.08

   ldap URIs now support _scope() and _filter() methods that
   don't have default values.  Suggested by Graham Barr.

   Incorporated old rejected MSWin32 patch to t/old-base.t.
   Hope it works.



2000-06-13   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   character.

   Typo in URI::ldap spotted by Graham Barr.



1999-06-24   Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>

   of $uri->query_form and $uri->query_keywords.

   Make compatibility URI::URL->new("mailto:gisle@aas.no")->netloc
   work again.
