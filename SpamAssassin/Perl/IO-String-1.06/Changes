   Make seek() return TRUE when it succeed.  It used to
   return the new position, but we want to be compatible with
   the builtin seek().
   Patch contributed by Kurt M. Brown <kurtb149@yahoo.com>

   Make print() and printf() return TRUE even when printing
   the empty string.  The used to return the lenght of the string
   printed, but now they always return 1 to be compatible with
   the builtins.

   Make binmode() return TRUE unless layers are provided.
