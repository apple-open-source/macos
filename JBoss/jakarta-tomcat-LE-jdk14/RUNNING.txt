               Running The Tomcat 4.0 Servlet/JSP Container
               ============================================

This subproject contains Tomcat 4.0, a server that implements the Servlet 2.3
and JSP 1.2 Specifications from Java Software.  In order to install and run
this container, you must do the following:


(0) Download and Install a Java Development Kit

* Download a Java Development Kit (JDK) release (version 1.2 or later) from:

    http://java.sun.com/j2se/

* Install the JDK according to the instructions included with the release.

* Set an environment variable JAVA_HOME to the pathname of the directory
  into which you installed the JDK release.


(1) Download and Install the Tomcat 4.0 Binary Distribution

NOTE:  As an alternative to downloading a binary distribution, you can create
your own from the Tomcat source repository, as described in "BUILDING.txt".
If you do this, the value to use for "${catalina.home}" will be the "dist"
subdirectory of your source distribution.

* Download a binary distribution of Tomcat from:

    http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-tomcat-4.0/nightly/

  On a Windows platform, you will need:
    jakarta-tomcat-4.0-YYYYMMDD.zip

  On a Unix platform, you will need:
    jakarta-tomcat-4.0-YYYYMMDD.zip

* Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location so that the
  distribution resides in its own directory (conventionally named
  "jakarta-tomcat-4.0").  For the purposes of the remainder of this document,
  the symbolic name "${catalina.home}" is used to refer to the full
  pathname of the release directory.


(2) Start Up Tomcat 4.0

There are two techniques by which Tomcat 4.0 can be started:

* Via an environment variable:
  - Set an environment variable CATALINA_HOME to the path of the directory
    into which you have installed Tomcat 4.0.
  - Execute the shell command:

      %CATALINA_HOME%\bin\startup             (Windows)

      $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh           (Unix)

* By modifying your current working directory:
  - Execute the following shell commands:

      cd %CATALINA_HOME%\bin                  (Windows)
      startup                                 (Windows)

      cd $CATALINA_HOME/bin                   (Unix)
      ./startup.sh                            (Unix)

After startup, the default web applications included with Tomcat 4.0 will be
available by browsing:

    http://localhost:8080/

Further information about configuring and running Tomcat 4.0 can be found in
the documentation included here, as well as on the Tomcat web site:

    http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/


(3) Shut Down Tomcat 4.0

There are two techniques by which Tomcat 4.0 can be stopped:

* Via an environment variable:
  - Set an environment variable CATALINA_HOME to the path of the directory
    into which you have installed Tomcat 4.0.
  - Execute the shell command:

      %CATALINA_HOME%\bin\shutdown            (Windows)

      $CATALINA_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh          (Unix)

* By modifying your current working directory:
  - Execute the following shell commands:

      cd %CATALINA_HOME%\bin                  (Windows)
      shutdown                                (Windows)

      cd $CATALINA_HOME/bin                   (Unix)
      ./shutdown.sh                           (Unix)


(4) Advanced Configuration - Multiple Tomcat 4 Instances

In many circumstances, it is desirable to have a single copy of a Tomcat 4
binary distribution shared among multiple users on the same server.  To make
this possible, you must configure a CATALINA_BASE environment variable (in
addition to CATALINA_HOME as described above) that points to a directory
that is unique to your instance.

When you do this, Tomcat 4 will calculate all relative references for files in
the following directories based on the value for CATALINA_BASE instead of
CATALINA_HOME:

* conf - Server configuration files (including server.xml)

* logs - Log and output files

* webapps - Automatically loaded web applications

* work - Temporary working directories for web applications

* temp - Directory used by the JVM for temporary files (java.io.tmpdir)

If you do not set CATALINA_BASE to an explicit value, it will be initialized
to the same value as is set for CATALINA_HOME (which means that the same
directory is used for all relative path resolutions).

The administration and manager web applications, which are defined in the
$CATALINA_BASE/webapps/admin.xml and $CATALINA_BASE/webapps/manager.xml will
not run in that configuration, unless either:
- The path specified in the docBase attribute of the Context element is made 
  absolute, and replaced respectively by $CATALINA_HOME/server/webapps/admin 
  and $CATALINA_HOME/server/webapps/manager
- Copying and linking both web applications in $CATALINA_BASE, and modify 
  accordingly the path specified in the docBase attribute of the Context 
  element
- Disabling both web applications by removing $CATALINA_BASE/webapps/admin.xml
  and $CATALINA_BASE/webapps/manager.xml


(5) Troubleshooting:

There are only really 3 things that can go wrong during the stand-alone
Tomcat 4.0 install:

1) The most common hiccup is when another web server (or any process for that
   matter) has laid claim to port 8080.  This is the default HTTP port that
   Tomcat attempts to bind to at startup.  To change this, open the file:

       $CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml
    
   ...and search for '8080'.  Change it to a port that isn't in use, and is
   greater than 1024, as ports less than or equal to 1024 require superuser
   access to bind to.
   
   Restart Tomcat and you're in business.  Be sure that you replace the "8080"
   in the URL you're using to access Tomcat.  For example, if you change the
   port to 1977, you would request the URL http://localhost:1977/.

2) An "out of environment space" error when running the batch files in
   Win9X/ME-based operating systems.

   Right-click on the STARTUP.BAT and SHUTDOWN.BAT files.  Click on
   "Properties" then on the "Memory" tab.  For the "Initial environment" field,
   enter in something like 4096.
   
   After you click apply, Windows will create shortcuts in the directory with
   which you can use to start and stop the container.

3) The 'localhost' machine isn't found.  This could happen if you're behind a
   proxy.  If that's the case, make sure the proxy configuration for your
   browser knows that you shouldn't be going through the proxy to access the
   "localhost" machine.
   
   In Netscape, this is under Edit/preferences -> Advanced/proxies, and in
   Internet Explorer, Tools -> Internet Options -> Connections -> LAN Settings.
