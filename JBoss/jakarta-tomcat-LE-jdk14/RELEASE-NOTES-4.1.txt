        of tags are used.

        Add tag instance reuse for performance improvement.

[4.1.4] Generator:
        Add tag BodyContent reuse.

         JspServletWrapper:
         Fix recompilation logic.

[4.1.21] Compiler:
         An ant Project uses the current directory as its base directory 
         by default. The base directory doesn't matter but ant always checks 
         it. This can cause problems when using the SecurityManager 
         with a strict policy. The Compiler now explicitely sets the ant 
         Project base dir to catalina.home.

[4.1.21] Generator:

============================
KNOWN ISSUES IN THIS RELEASE:
============================

* Tomcat 4.1 and JNI Based Applications
* Tomcat 4.1 Standard APIs Available
* Tomcat 4.1 and XML Parsers
* Web application reloading and static fields in shared libraries
* Tomcat on Linux
* Enabling SSI and CGI Support
* Security manager URLs
* Symlinking static resources
* Enabling invoker servlet


-------------------------------------
Tomcat 4.1 and JNI Based Applications:
-------------------------------------

Applications that require native libraries must ensure that the libraries have
been loaded prior to use.  Typically, this is done with a call like:

  static {
    System.loadLibrary("path-to-library-file");
  }

in some class.  However, the application must also ensure that the library is
not loaded more than once.  If the above code were placed in a class inside
the web application (i.e. under /WEB-INF/classes or /WEB-INF/lib), and the
application were reloaded, the loadLibrary() call would be attempted a second
time.

To avoid this problem, place classes that load native libraries outside of the
web application, and ensure that the loadLibrary() call is executed only once
during the lifetime of a particular JVM.


----------------------------------
Tomcat 4.1 Standard APIs Available:
----------------------------------

A standard installation of Tomcat 4 makes all of the following APIs available
for use by web applications (by placing them in "common/lib" or "shared/lib"):
* activation.jar (Java Activation Framework)
* ant.jar (Apache Ant 1.5.1)
* commons-collections.jar (Commons Collections 2.1)
* commons-dbcp.jar (Commons DBCP 1.0)
* commons-logging-api.jar (Commons Logging 1.0.2)
* commons-pool.jar (Commons Pool 1.0)
* jasper-compiler.jar (Jasper 2 Compiler)
* jasper-runtime.jar (Jasper 2 Runtime)
* jdbc2_0-stdext.jar (JDBC 2.0 Optional Package, javax.sql.*)
* jndi.jar (JNDI 1.2 base API classes)
* jta.jar (Java Transacation API 1.0.1a)
* mail.jar (JavaMail 1.2)
* naming-common.jar (JNDI Context implementation)
* naming-factory.jar (JNDI object factories)
* naming-resources.jar (JNDI DirContext implementations)
* servlet.jar (Servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 APIs)

You can make additional APIs available to all of your web applications by
putting unpacked classes into a "classes" directory (not created by default),
or by placing them in JAR files in the "lib" directory.

Tomcat 4.1 also makes available Xerces 2.3.0 to web applications.


--------------------------
Tomcat 4.1 and XML Parsers:
--------------------------

As described above, Tomcat 4.1 makes an XML parser (and many other standard
APIs) available to web applications.  This parser is also used internally
to parse web.xml files and the server.xml configuration file.  If you wish,
you may replace the "xercesImpl.jar" file in "common/endorsed" with another 
XML parser, as long as it is compatible with the JAXP 1.1 APIs.


---------------------------------------------------------------
Web application reloading and static fields in shared libraries:
---------------------------------------------------------------

Some shared libraries (many are part of the JDK) keep references to objects
instantiated by the web application. To avoid class loading related problems
(ClassCastExceptions, messages indicating that the classloader 
is stopped, ...), the shared libraries state should be reinitialized.

Something which could help is to avoid putting classes which would be 
referenced by a shared static field in the web application classloader, 
and put them in the shared classloader instead (the JARs should be put in the 
"lib" folder, and classes should be put in the "classes" folder).


---------------
Tomcat on Linux:
---------------

Virtual machine crashes can be experienced when using certain combinations of
kernel / glibc under Linux with Sun Hotspot 1.2 to 1.3. The crashes were 
reported to occur mostly on startup. Sun JDK 1.4 does not exhibit the problems,
and neither does IBM JDK for Linux.

The problems can be fixed by reducing the default stack size. At bash shell, 
do "ulimit -s 2048"; use "limit stacksize 2048" for tcsh.

GLIBC 2.2 / Linux 2.4 users should also define an environment variable:
export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5

Additionally, Redhat 9.0 users should use the same setting, to avoid stability
problems.


----------------------------
Enabling SSI and CGI Support:
----------------------------

Having CGI and SSI available to web applications created security problems when
using a security manager (as a malicious web application could use them to 
sidestep the security manager access control). In Tomcat 4.1, they have been
disabled by default, as our goal is to provide a fully secure default 
configuration. However, CGI and SSI remain available.

On Windows:
* rename the file %CATALINA_HOME%\server\lib\servlets-cgi.renametojar to
  %CATALINA_HOME%\server\lib\servlets-cgi.jar.
* rename the file %CATALINA_HOME%\server\lib\servlets-ssi.renametojar to
  %CATALINA_HOME%\server\lib\servlets-ssi.jar.
* in %CATALINA_HOME%\conf\web.xml, uncomment the servlet declarations starting
  line 165 and 213, as well as the associated servlet mappings 
  line 265 and 274. Alternately, these servlet declarations and mappings can
  be added to your web application deployment descriptor.

On Unix:
* rename the file $CATALINA_HOME/server/lib/servlets-cgi.renametojar to
  $CATALINA_HOME/server/lib/servlets-cgi.jar.
* rename the file $CATALINA_HOME/server/lib/servlets-ssi.renametojar to
  $CATALINA_HOME/server/lib/servlets-ssi.jar.
* in $CATALINA_HOME/conf/web.xml, uncomment the servlet declarations starting
  line 165 and 213, as well as the associated servlet mappings 
  line 265 and 274. Alternately, these servlet declarations and mappings can
  be added to your web application deployment descriptor.


---------------------
Security manager URLs:
---------------------

The URLs to be used in the policy file to grant permissions to JARs located
inside the web application repositories have changed in Tomcat 4.1.

In Tomcat 4.0, codeBase URLs for JARs loaded from web application 
repositories were:
jar:file:${catalina.home}/webapps/examples/WEB-INF/lib/driver.jar!/-

In Tomcat 4.1, they should be:
file:${catalina.home}/webapps/examples/WEB-INF/lib/driver.jar


---------------------------
Symlinking static resources:
---------------------------

Unix symlinks will not work when used in a web application to link resources 
located outside the web application root directory.

This behavior is optional, and the "allowLinking" flag may be used to disable
the check.


------------------------
Enabling invoker servlet:
------------------------

Starting with Tomcat 4.1.12, the invoker servlet is no longer available by 
default in all webapp. Enabling it for all webapps is possible by editing
$CATALINA_HOME/conf/web.xml to uncomment the "/servlet/*" servlet-mapping
definition.

Using the invoker servlet in a production environment is not recommended and
is unsupported.


-----------------------------
Using the JSP Compiler (JSPC):
-----------------------------

Using the command line script is not recommended when using JSPC. Instead, 
using Ant is supported and encouraged. Please see the Jasper documentation
in the Tomcat documentation bundle for more instructions as well as 
a build script.
