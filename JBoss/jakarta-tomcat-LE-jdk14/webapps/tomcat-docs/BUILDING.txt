               Building The Tomcat 4.0 Servlet/JSP Container
               =============================================

This subproject contains the source code Tomcat 4.0, a server that implements
the Servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 Specifications from Java Software.  In order to
build a binary distribution version of the container from a source
distribution, you must have a Java Development Kit (JDK) for version 1.3 (or
later) downloaded and installed (version 1.3.1 recommended), and do the
following:


(0) Download and Install a Java Development Kit

* Download a Java Development Kit (JDK) release (version 1.3 or later) from:

    http://java.sun.com/j2se/

* Install the JDK according to the instructions included with the release.

* Set an environment variable JAVA_HOME to the pathname of the directory
  into which you installed the JDK release.


(1) Download and Install the Ant Binary Distribution

NOTE: Previous versions of Tomcat 4.0 relied on Ant 1.3 for the build
process. The 1.5 release is now required.

* Download a binary distribution of Ant 1.5 from:

    http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-ant/release/v1.5/bin/

  On a Windows platform, you will need:
    jakarta-ant-1.5-bin.zip

  On a Unix platform, you will need:
    jakarta-ant-1.5-bin.tar.gz

* Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location so that the
  Ant release resides in its own directory (conventionally named
  "jakarta-ant-1.5").  For the purposes of the remainder of this document,
  the symbolic name "${ant.home}" is used to refer to the full pathname of
  the release directory.

* Modify the PATH environment variable to include directory
  "${ant.home}/bin" in its list.  This makes the "ant" command line script
  available, which will be used to actually perform the build.


(2) Download and Install the Java XML Pack Binary Distribution

* Download a binary distribution of Java XML Pack:

    http://java.sun.com/xml/downloads/javaxmlpack.html

* Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location so that the
  Java XML Pack release resides in its own directory (the JAXP libraries
  reside in the jaxp-1.1.3 subdirectory).  For the purposes of the 
  remainder of this document, the symbolic name "${jaxp.home}" is used 
  to refer to the full pathname to the jaxp-1.1.3 subdirectory of the 
  Java XML Pack release directory.

* Make the "xalan.jar" file of this distribution available to Ant (so that
  it can be used with the <style> tag) by copying it to "${ant.home}/lib".

* This is optional with JDK 1.4 or later.


(3) Download and Install the JNDI 1.2.1 Reference Implementation

* Download the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) package,
  (version 1.2.1 or later) from

    http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/

* Unpack the reference implementation into a convenient location so that
  it resides in its own subdirectory.

* You will also need the LDAP Service Provider Maintenance package,
  (version 1.2.3 or later) available on the same download page. Be sure
  that you unpack "ldap.jar" and "jaas.jar" into the "lib" subdirectory of
  the JNDI directory, parallel to "jndi.jar".

* This is optional with JDK 1.3 or later.


(4) Download and Install the Xerces 1 or 2 Distribution

* Download a binary distribution from:

  http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-j/

  (Tomcat was tested with "Xerces-J-bin.1.4.3.zip")

* Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location so that the
  distribution resides in its own directory (conventionally named
  "xerces-x_y_z").

* In your build.properties file, you will need to set properties differently
  based on which version of Xerces you are using:
  - For versions 1.3.1 up through and including 2.0.0beta3,
    set the "xerces.jar" property to point at the full
    pathname of the corresponding file.
  - For version 2.0.0beta4 and later, set the "xmlParserAPIs.jar"
    and "xercesImpl.jar" properties to point at the corresponding
    files
  - If you have defined both sets of properties, the newer (two files)
    packaging will be loaded into the Tomcat you are building

* This is optional with JDK 1.4 or later.


(5) Download and Install Subproject Source Code

* Use Anonymous CVS (as described on the Jakarta web site at
  <http://jakarta.apache.org/site/cvsindex.html>, or
  download a source distribution from:

    http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-tomcat-4.0/nightly/src/

  On a Windows platform, you will need:
    jakarta-tomcat-4.0-src-YYYYMMDD.zip

  On a Unix platform, you will need:
    jakarta-tomcat-4.0-src-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz

  (NOTE:  Alternatively, you can grab the source distribution from a
  formal release, if you wish, by following links on the Jakarta web site).

* Unpack the source distribution into a convenient location so that the
  distribution resides in its own directory (conventionally named
  "jakarta-tomcat-4.0").  For the purposes of the remainder of this document,
  the symbolic name "${tomcat.source}" is used to refer to the full
  pathname of the release directory.

* Use Anonymous CVS (as described on the Jakarta web site at
  <http://jakarta.apache.org/site/cvsindex.html>, or
  download a source distribution of the "jakarta-tomcat-connectors" repository.

* Unpack the source distribution into a convenient location so that the
  distribution resides in its own directory (conventionally named
  "jakarta-tomcat-connectors").  By default, the build system will try to find
  this repository in the "${tomcat.source}/../jakarta-tomcat-connectors"
  directory.  Set the "jtc.home" property in the build.properties file 
  described below (see 26) if it resides in a different directory.


(6) Download and Install the Servlet API Binary Distribution

NOTE:  Alternatively, you can download the sources of the
"jakarta-servletapi-4" subproject, and build a binary distribution yourself,
or use the binary distribution that is available with binary distributions

(26) Customize Build Properties For This Subproject

Most Jakarta subprojects allow you to customize Ant properties (with default
values defined in the "build.xml" file.  This is done by creating a text file
named "build.properties" in the source distribution directory (for property
definitions local to this subproject) and/or your user home directory (for
property definitions shared across subprojects).  You can use the included
"build.properties.sample" file as a starting point for this.

Tomcat has many external dependencies that are satisfied by configuring
appropriate values in your build.properties file.  The easiest
way to satisfy these dependencies is to copy the "build.properties.sample"
file (in the top-level Tomcat source directory) to "build.properties", and
then edit it to suit your environment.  On Unix, this would be done as:

  cd ${tomcat.source}
  cp build.properties.sample build.properties
  emacs build.properties

NOTE:  Be *sure* that you do not check "build.properties" in to the CVS
repository.  This file is local to your own development environment, and
each developer will have their own version.


(27) Build A Binary Distribution

Open a command line shell, and issue the following commands:

  cd ${tomcat.source}
  ant -projecthelp

If everything is installed correctly, you should see a list of the Ant
"targets" that represent different commands you might wish to build.

You can check that all dependencies are correctly installed by using 
the following commands:

  cd ${tomcat.source}
  ant detect

By convention, the "dist" target creates a complete binary distribution.  To
execute it, type the following commands:

  cd ${tomcat.source}
  ant dist

This will create a complete binary distribution of the subproject (equivalent
in structure to the corresponding binary distribution downloadable from the
Jakarta web site), in the "${tomcat.source}/dist" directory.  It will have
the contents described in the corresponding "README.txt" file.

See the document RUNNING.txt for instructions on how to start up and shut down
the servlet/JSP container.
