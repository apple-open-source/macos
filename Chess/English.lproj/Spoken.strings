/* Written rather repetitively, because I'm not sure what gender agreements 
   are going to be necessary in what languages.
 
   NOTE TO LOCALIZERS

   All of these strings are meant to be spoken, they will never be used visually, so
   don't worry about left-to-right codes etc.
 
   These translations are NOT triggered by the system locale, but by the language 
   of the VOICE selected in Chess preferences. On an English system, if Yannick is
   selected as a Chess voice, Chess will speak German!
