Trouble detecting variants and partner tells on chess.net. This is 
an XBoard/WinBoard Zippy problem, not related to Sjeng itself.

The 'ping' command interrupts the search.

'white' and 'black' do not always work as intended.

A condition which ends the game will stop the program when in analysis 
mode.

Loses sometimes.
