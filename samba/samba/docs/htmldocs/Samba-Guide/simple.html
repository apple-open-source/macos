	Congratulations, you managed to get past the opening chapter. To some, this is where the interesting
	exercises begin. This is the start of the real journey toward the Samba deployment of a lifetime.
	</p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2510185"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
	This chapter lays the groundwork for understanding the basics of Samba operation. 
	Instead of a bland technical discussion, each principle is demonstrated by way of a 
	real-world scenario for which a working solution<sup>[<a name="id2510197" href="#ftn.id2510197">2</a>]</sup> is fully described.
	</p><p>
	The practical exercises take you on a journey through a drafting office, a charity administration
	office, and an accounting office. You may choose to apply any or all of these to your own environment.
	</p><p>
	Every assignment case can be implemented far more creatively, but remember that the solutions you
	create are designed to demonstrate a particular solution possibility. With experience, you should
	find much improved solutions compared with those presented here. By the time you complete this book,
	you should aim to be a Samba expert, so do attempt to find better solutions and try them as you work your
	way through the examples.

	Each case presented highlights different aspects of Windows networking for which a simple 
	Samba-based solution can be provided. Each has subtly different requirements taken from real-world cases.
	Each is briefly reviewed to cover points of highlight. In each example, instructions are based
	on the assumption that the official Samba Team RPM package has been installed.

	Let's get started.
	</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2510268"></a>Drafting Office</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
	Our fictitious company is called <span class="emphasis"><em>Abmas Design Inc.</em></span> This is a three-person
	computer-aided design (CAD) business that often has more work than can be handled. The 
	business owner hires contract draftspeople from wherever he can. They bring their own 
	notebook computers into the office. There are four permanent drafting machines. Abmas has a 
	collection of over 10 years of plans that must be available for all draftsmen to reference. 
	Abmas hires the services of an experienced network engineer to update the 
	plans that are stored on a central server one day per month. She knows how to upload 
	plans from each machine. The files available from the server must remain read-only. 
	Anyone should be able to access the plans at any time and without barriers or difficulty.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2510295"></a>
	Mr. Bob Jordan has asked you to install the new server as economically as possible. The central
	server has a Pentium-IV 1.6GHz CPU, 768MB RAM, a 20GB IDE boot drive, a 160GB IDE second disk
	to store plans, and a 100-base-T Ethernet card. You have already installed Red Hat Linux 9.0 and
	have upgraded Samba to version 3.0.2 using the RPM package that is provided from the Samba
	<a href="http://www.samba.org" target="_top">FTP</a> sites.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2510318"></a>
	The four permanent drafting machines (Microsoft Windows workstations) have attached printers 
	and plotters that are shared on a peer-to-peer basis by any/all network users. The intent 
	is to continue to share printers in this manner. The three permanent staff work together with 
	all contractors to store all new work on one PC. A daily copy is made of the work storage 
	area to another PC for safekeeping.  When the network consultant arrives, the weekly work 
	area is copied to the central server and the files are removed from the main weekly storage 
	machine. The office works best with this arrangement and does not want to change anything. 
	Old habits are too ingrained.
	</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2510351"></a>Dissection and Discussion</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2510358"></a>
		The requirements for this server installation demand simplicity. An anonymous read-only
		file server adequately meets all needs. The network consultant determines how
		to upload all files from the weekly storage area to the server. This installation should
		focus only on critical aspects of the installation.
		</p><p>
		It is not necessary to have specific users on the server. The site has a method for storing
		all design files (plans). Each plan is stored in a directory that is named YYYYWW<sup>[<a name="id2510382" href="#ftn.id2510382">3</a>]</sup>, where
		YYYY is the year, and WW is the week of the year. This arrangement allows work to be stored
		by week of year to preserve the filing technique the site is familiar with.
		There is another customer directory that is alphabetically listed. At the top level are 26
		directories (A-Z), in each is a second level of directory for the first plus second letter of the name
		(A-Z); inside each is a directory by the customers' name. Inside each directory is a symbolic
		link to each design drawing/plan. This way of storing customer data files permits all
		plans to be located both by customer name, as well as by the date the work was performed, without
		demanding the disk space that would be needed if a duplicate file copy were to be stored. 
		The share containing the plans is called <span class="emphasis"><em>Plans</em></span>.
		</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2510411"></a>Implementation</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>
		It is assumed that the server is fully installed and ready for installation and 
		configuration of Samba 3.0.2 and any support files needed. All TCP/IP addresses 
		have been hard coded. In our case the IP address of the Samba server is 
		<tt class="constant">192.168.1.1</tt> and the netmask is <tt class="constant">255.255.255.0</tt>. 
		The host name of the server used was <tt class="constant">server</tt>.

	The fictitious charity organization is called <span class="emphasis"><em>Abmas Vision NL</em></span>. This is an
	office that has five networked computers. Staff are all volunteers with frequent staff changes.
	Ms. Amy May, the director of operations, wants a no-hassle network. Anyone should be able to
	use any PC. Only two Windows applications are used: a custom funds tracking and management package
	that stores all files on the central server and Microsoft Word. The office prepares mail-out
	letters, letters of invitation, and thank-you notes. All files must be stored in perpetuity.
	The custom funds tracking and management software has been configured to use a server named
	<tt class="constant">SERVER</tt>, a share named <tt class="constant">FTMFILES</tt>, and a printer queue
	named <tt class="constant">PRINTQ</tt> that uses preprinted stationery, thus demanding a
	dedicated printer. This printer does not need to be mapped to a local printer on the workstations.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2511115"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2511123"></a>
	Printer handling in Samba results in a significant level of confusion. Samba presents to the
	MS Windows client only a print queue. The Samba <span><b class="command">smbd</b></span> process passes a
	print job sent to it from the Windows client to the native UNIX printing system. The native
	UNIX printing system (spooler) places the job in a print queue from which it is
	delivered to the printer. In this book, network diagrams refer to a printer by the name 
	of the print queue that services that printer. It does not matter what the fully qualified 
	name (or the host name) of a network attached printer is. The UNIX print spooler is configured 
	to correctly deliver all jobs to the printer.
	</p><p>
	This organization has a policy forbidding use of privately owned computers on site as a measure
	to prevent leakage of confidential information. Only the five PCs owned by Abmas Vision NL are
	used on this network.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2511158"></a>
	The central server was donated by a local computer store. It is a dual processor Pentium-III
	server, has 1GB RAM, a 3-Ware IDE RAID Controller that has 4 x 200GB IDE hard drives, and a
	100-base-T network card. The office has 100-base-T permanent network connections that go to
	a central hub and all equipment is new. The five network computers all are equipped with Microsoft
	Windows Me. Funding is limited, so the server has no operating system on it. You have approval
	to install Samba on Linux, but just make sure it works without problems. There are two HP LaserJet
	5 PS printers that are network connected.  The second printer is to be used for general
	office and letter printing. Your recommendation to allow only the Linux server to print directly
	to the printers was accepted. You have supplied SUSE Enterprise Linux Server version 8.0 and
	have upgraded Samba to version 3.0.2.

		This installation demands simplicity. Frequent turn-over of volunteer staff would indicate that
		a network environment that requires users to logon might be problematic. It is suggested that the
		best solution for this office would be one where the user can log onto any PC with any username
		and password. Samba can accommodate an office like this by using the <i class="parameter"><tt>force user</tt></i>
		parameter in share and printer definitions. The use of the <i class="parameter"><tt>force user</tt></i>
		ensures that all files are owned by same user identifier (UID) and thus ensures that there
		will never be a problem with file access due to file access permissions. Additionally, you elect
		to use the <i class="parameter"><tt>nt acl support = No</tt></i> option to ensure that no attempts can be
		made to write access control lists (Posix type) to any file or directory. This prevents
		an inadvertent ACL from overriding actual file permissions.

		<a class="indexterm" name="id2511264"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2511271"></a>
		This organization is a prime candidate for Share Mode security. The <i class="parameter"><tt>force user</tt></i>
		allows all files to be owned by the same user and group. In addition to this, it would not hurt to
		set SUID and set SGID shared directories. This means that all new files that are created, no matter
		who creates it, are owned by the owner or group of the directory in which they are created.
		For further information regarding the significance of the SUID/SGID settings, see 
		<a href="appendix.html#ch12-SUIDSGID" title="Effect of Setting File and Directory SUID/SGID Permissions Explained">???</a>.

		All client workstations print to a print queue on the server. This ensures that print jobs
		continue to print in the event that a user may shut down the workstation immediately after
		sending a job to the printer. Today, both Red Hat Linux and SUSE Linux use CUPS-based printing. 
		Older Linux systems offered a choice to use either the LPRng printing system, or CUPS. It appears, however,
		that CUPS has now become the leading UNIX printing technology.
		</p><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2511347"></a>
		The print queues are set up as <tt class="constant">Raw</tt> devices, which means that CUPS will 
		not do intelligent print processing, and vendor supplied drivers be installed locally on the 
		Windows clients.
		</p><p>
		The hypothetical software (Funds Tracking and Management) referred to is representative of 
		custom-built software that directly uses a NetBIOS interface. Most such software originated in
		the days of MS/PC DOS. NetBIOS names are upper-case (and functionally are case insensitive), 
		thus some old software applications would permit only upper-case names to be entered.
		Some such applications were later ported to MS Windows but retain the upper-case network
		resource naming conventions because customers are familiar with that. We made the decision
		to name shares and print queues for this application in upper-case also for the same reason.
		Nothing would break if you were to use lower-case names, but that decision might create a need
		to re-educate staff  something well avoided at this time.
		</p><p>
		NetBIOS networking does not print directly to a printer. Instead, all printing is done to a
		print queue. The print spooling system is responsible for communicating with the physical
		printer. In this example, therefore, the resource that is referred to as <tt class="constant">PRINTQ</tt>
		really is just a print queue. The name of the print queue is held to be representative of
		the device to which the print spooler delivers print jobs.

				The <span><b class="command">chown</b></span> operation sets the owner to the user <tt class="constant">abmas</tt>
				and the group to <tt class="constant">office</tt> on all directories just created. And
				the <span><b class="command">chmod</b></span> operation recursively sets the permissions so that
				the owner and group have SUID/SGID with read/write/execute permission, and everyone else has 
				read and execute permission. This means that all files and directories are created
				with the same owner and group as the directory in which they are created. Any new
				directories created still have the same owner, group, and permissions as the
				directory they are in. This should eliminate all permissions-based file access problems.

	The office of Abmas Accounting Inc. is a 40-year-old family-run business. There are nine permanent
	computer users. The network clients were upgraded two years ago. All computers run Windows 2000
	Professional. This year the server will be upgraded from an old Windows NT4 server (actually
	running Windows NT4 Workstation, which worked fine as there were fewer than 10 users) that has
	run in workgroup (Stand-Alone) mode, to a new Linux server running Samba.
	</p><p>
	The office does not want a Domain Server. Mr. Alan Meany wants to keep the Windows 2000 Professional
	clients running as workgroup machines so that any staff member can take a machine home and keep 
	working.  It has worked well so far and your task is to replace the old server. All users have 
	their own workstation logon (you configured it that way when the machines were installed). 
	Mr. Meany wants the new system to operate the same way as the old Windows NT4 server  users 
	cannot access each others' files, but he can access everyone's files. Each person's work files are 
	in a separate share on the server. Users logon to their Windows workstation with their username 
	and enter an assigned password; they do not need to enter a password when accessing their files 
	on the server.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2513147"></a>
	The new server will run Red Hat Linux 9.0. You should install Samba-3.0.2 and 
	copy all files off the old system to the new one. The existing Windows NT4 server has a parallel
	port HP LaserJet 4 printer that is shared by all. The printer driver is installed on each
	workstation. You must not change anything on the workstations. Mr. Meany gave instructions to
	replace the server &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>but leave everything else alone to avoid staff unrest.</em></span></span>&#8221;
	</p><p>
	You have tried to educate Mr. Meany and found that he has no interest to understand networking.
	He believes that Windows for Workgroups 3.11 was &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>the best server Microsoft ever sold
	</em></span></span>&#8221; and that Windows NT and 2000 are &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>too fang-dangled complex!</em></span></span>&#8221;

			<a class="indexterm" name="id2513193"></a>
			The requirements of this network installation are not unusual. The staff are not interested in the
			details of networking. Passwords are never changed. In this example solution, we demonstrate the use
			of User Mode security in a simple context. Directories should be set SGID to ensure that members
			of a common group can access the contents. Each user has his or her own share to which only they
			can connect. Mr. Meany's share will be a top level directory above the share point for each employee.
			Mr. Meany is a member of the same group as his staff and is able to access their work files.
			The well used HP LaserJet 4 is available as a service called <tt class="constant">hplj</tt>.
			</p><p>
			You have finished configuring the new hardware and have just completed installation of Red Hat Linux
			9.0. Roll up your sleeves and let's get to work.

		The workstations have fixed IP addresses. The old server runs Windows NT4 Workstation, so it 
		cannot be running as a WINS server. It is best that the new configuration preserves the same
		configuration. The office does not use Internet access, so security really is not an issue.

		The parameter <i class="parameter"><tt>force user</tt></i> causes all operations on the share to assume the UID

		</p><p>
		When a directory is set SUID, the operating system forces files that are written within it
		to be owned by the owner of the directory. While this happens, the user who is using the share
		has only the level of privilege he or she is assigned within the operating system context.

		What is better about CUPS printing than LPRng printing?
		</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"><b></b></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
		CUPS is a print spooling system that has integrated remote management facilities, provides completely
		automated print processing/preprocessing, and has the potential to be configured to automatically
		apply print preprocessing filters to ensure that a print job submitted is correctly rendered for the
		target printer. CUPS includes an image file RIP that supports printing of image files to 
		non-PostScript printers. CUPS has lots of bells and whistles and is more like a super-charged MS Windows
		NT/200x print monitor and processor. Its complexity can be eliminated or turbo-charged to suit
		any fancy.
		</p><p>
		The LPRng software is an enhanced, extended, and portable implementation of the Berkeley LPR print 
		spooler functionality. It provides the same interface and meets RFC1179 requirements. LPRng is capable
		of being configured to act like CUPS, but it is in principle a replacement for the old Berkeley lpr/lpd
		spooler. LPRng is generally preferred by those who are familiar with Berkeley lpr/lpd.
		</p><p>
		Which is better is a matter of personal taste. It depends on what you want to do and how you want to
		do it and manage it. Most modern Linux systems ship with CUPS as the default print management system.

		When should Windows client IP addresses be hard coded?
		</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"><b></b></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
		When there are few MS Windows clients, little client change, no mobile users, and users are not
		inclined to tamper with network settings, it is a safe and convenient matter to hard-code Windows
		client TCP/IP settings. Given that it is possible to lock down the Windows desktop and remove
		user ability to access network configuration controls, fixed configuration eliminates the need
		for a DHCP server. This reduces maintenance overheads and eliminates a possible point of network
		failure.

		Under what circumstances would it be best to use a DHCP server?
		</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"><b></b></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
		In network configurations where there are mobile users, or where Windows client PCs move around
		(particularly between offices or between subnets), it makes complete sense to control all Windows
		client configurations using a DHCP server. Additionally, when users do tamper with the network
		settings, the use of DHCP can be used to normalize all client settings. 
		</p><p>
		One of the least appreciated benefits of using a DHCP server to assign all network client
		device TCP/IP settings is that it makes it a pain-free process to change network TCP/IP
		settings, change network addressing, or enhance the ability of client devices to
		benefit from new network services.
		</p><p>
		Another benefit of modern DHCP servers is the ability of the DHCP server to register dynamically
		assigned IP addresses with the DNS server. The benefits of Dynamic DNS (DDNS) are considerable in 
		a large Windows network environment.

		When would you set the global parameter <i class="parameter"><tt>disable spoolss</tt></i>?
		</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"><b></b></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
		Setting this parameter to <tt class="constant">Yes</tt> disables Samba's support for the SPOOLSS set of 
		MS-RPC's and yields behavior identical to Samba 2.0.x. Windows NT/2000 clients can downgrade to 
		using LanMan style printing commands. Windows 9x/ME are unaffected by the parameter. However, this 
		disables the ability to upload printer drivers to a Samba server via the Windows NT/200x Add Printer 
		Wizard or by using the NT printer properties dialog window. It also disables the capability of 
		Windows NT/200x clients to download print drivers from the Samba host on demand. Be extremely careful about 
		setting this parameter.
		</p><p>
		The alternate parameter <i class="parameter"><tt>use client driver</tt></i> applies only to Windows NT/200x clients. It has no 
		effect on Windows 95/98/ME clients. When serving a printer to Windows NT/200x clients without first installing a valid 
		printer driver on the Samba host, the client is required to install a local printer driver. From this point on, 
		the client treats the printer as a local printer and not a network printer connection. This is much the same behavior 
		that occurs when <i class="parameter"><tt>disable spoolss = yes</tt></i>.
		</p><p>
		Under normal circumstances, the NT/200x client attempts to open the network printer using MS-RPC. Because the client 
		considers the printer to be local, it attempts to issue the OpenPrinterEx() call requesting access rights associated 
		with the logged on user. If the user possesses local administrator rights but not root privilege on the Samba host (often 
		the case), the OpenPrinterEx() call fails. The result is that the client now displays an "Access Denied; Unable 
		to connect" message in the printer queue window (even though jobs may be printed successfully). This parameter MUST
		not be enabled on a print share that has valid print driver installed on the Samba server.

		Why would you disable password caching on Windows 9x/Me clients?
		</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"><b></b></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
		Windows 9x/Me workstations that are set at default (password caching enabled) store the username and
		password in files located in the Windows master directory. Such files can be scavenged (read off a client
		machine) and decrypted, thus revealing the user's access credentials for all systems the user may have accessed.
		It is most insecure to allow any Windows 9x/Me client to operate with password caching enabled.
		</p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td align="left" valign="top"><a name="id2514936"></a><a name="id2514939"></a><b></b></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
		The example of Abmas Accounting Inc. uses User Mode security. How does this provide anonymous access?
		</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"><b></b></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
		The example used does not provide anonymous access. Since the clients are all Windows 2000 Professional,
		and given that users are logging onto their machines, by default the client attempts to connect to
		a remote server using currently logged in user credentials. By ensuring that the user's login ID and
		password is the same as those set on the Samba server, access is transparent and does not require
		separate user authentication.
