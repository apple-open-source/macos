	You are about to use the equivalent of a microscope to look at the information
	that runs through the veins of a Windows network. We do more to observe the information than
	to interrogate it. When you are done with this chapter, you should have a good understanding
	of the types of information that flow over the network. Do not worry, this is not
	a biology lesson. We won't lose you in unnecessary detail. Think to yourself, &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>This
	is easy,</em></span></span>&#8221; then tackle each exercise without fear.
	</p><p>
	Samba can be configured with a minimum of complexity. Simplicity should be mastered
	before you get too deeply into complexities. Let's get moving, we have work to do.

	Successful completion of this chapter requires two Microsoft Windows 9x/Me Workstations,
	as well as two Microsoft Windows XP Professional Workstations, each equipped with an Ethernet
	card connected using a hub. Also required is one additional server (either Windows
	NT4 Server, Windows 2000 Server, or a Samba-3 on UNIX/Linux server) running a network
	sniffer and analysis application (ethereal is a good choice). All work should be undertaken
	on a quiet network where there is no other traffic. It is best to use a dedicated hub
	with only the machines under test connected at the time of the exercises.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2506694"></a>
	Ethereal has become the network protocol analyzer of choice for many network administrators. 
	You may find more information regarding this tool from the 
	<a href="http://www.ethereal.com" target="_top">Ethereal</a> Web site. Ethereal installation 
	files for Windows may be obtained from the Ethereal Web site. Ethereal is provided with 
	SUSE and Red Hat Linux distributions, as well as many other Linux distributions. It may 
	not be installed on your system by default. If it is not installed, you may also need 
	to install the <span><b class="command">libpcap </b></span> software before you can install or use Ethereal. 
	Please refer to the instructions for your operating system or to the Ethereal Web site 
	for information regarding the installation and operation of Ethereal.
	</p><p>
	To obtain <span><b class="command">ethereal</b></span> for your system, please visit the Ethereal

	</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
	The successful completion of this chapter requires that you capture network traffic
	using <span><b class="command">ethereal</b></span>. It is recommended that you use a hub, not an
	etherswitch. It is necessary for the device used to act as a repeater, not as a
	filter. Ethernet switches may filter out traffic that is not directed at the machine
	that is used to monitor traffic; this would not allow you to complete the projects.
	</p></div><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2506763"></a>
	Do not worry too much if you do not have access to all this equipment; network captures
	from the exercises are provided on the enclosed CD-ROM. This makes it possible to dive directly
	into the analytical part of the exercises if you so desire.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2506778"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2506790"></a>
	Please do not be alarmed at the use of a high-powered analysis tool (ethereal) in this
	first chapter.  We expose you only to a minimum of detail necessary to complete 
	the exercises in this chapter. If you choose to use any other network sniffer and protocol
	analysis tool, be advised that it may not allow you to examine the contents of
	recently added security protocols used by Windows 200x/XP.
	</p><p>
	You could just skim through the exercises and try to absorb the key points made. 
	The exercises provide all the information necessary to convince the die-hard network 
	engineer. You possibly do not require so much convincing and may just want to move on, 
	in which case you should at least read <a href="primer.html#chap01conc" title="Dissection and Discussion">???</a>.
	</p><p>
	<a href="primer.html#chap01qa" title="Questions and Answers">???</a> also provides useful information
	that may help you to avoid significantly time-consuming networking problems.

	The purpose of this chapter is to create familiarity with key aspects of Microsoft Windows
	network computing. If you want a solid technical grounding, do not gloss over these exercises. 
	The points covered are recurrent issues on the Samba mailing lists. 
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2506951"></a>
	You can see from these exercises that Windows networking involves quite a lot of network
	broadcast traffic. You can look into the contents of some packets, but only to see
	some particular information that the Windows client sends to a server in the course of
	establishing a network connection.
	</p><p>
	To many people, browsing is everything that happens when one uses Microsoft Internet Explorer.
	It is only when you start looking at network traffic and noting the protocols
	and types of information that are used that you can begin to appreciate the complexities of
	Windows networking and, more importantly, what needs to be configured so that it can work.
	Detailed information regarding browsing is provided in the recommended
	preparatory reading.
	</p><p>
	Recommended preparatory reading: <span class="emphasis"><em>The Official Samba-3 HOWTO and Reference Guide</em></span> (TOSHARG)

		You are about to witness how Microsoft Windows computer networking functions. The
		exercises step through identification of how a client machine establishes a
		connection to a remote Windows server. You observe how Windows machines find
		each other (i.e., how browsing works), and how the two key types of user identification
		(share mode security and user mode security) are affected.
		</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2507031"></a>
		The networking protocols used by MS Windows networking when working with Samba
		use TCP/IP as the transport protocol. The protocols that are specific to Windows
		networking are encapsulated in TCP/IP. The network analyzer we use (ethereal)
		is able to show you the contents of the TCP/IP packets (or messages).

	<a class="indexterm" name="id2507134"></a>
	You are embarking on a course of discovery. The first part of the exercise requires
	two MS Windows 9x/Me systems. We called one machine <tt class="constant">WINEPRESSME</tt> and the
	other <tt class="constant">MILGATE98</tt>. Each needs an IP address; we used <tt class="literal">10.1.1.10</tt>
	and <tt class="literal">10.1.1.11</tt>. The test machines need to be networked via a <span class="emphasis"><em>hub</em></span>. A UNIX/Linux
	machine is required to run <span><b class="command">ethereal</b></span> to enable the network activity to be captured.
	It is important that the machine from which network activity is captured must not interfere with
	the operation of the Windows workstations. It is helpful for this machine to be passive (does not
	send broadcast information) to the network.
	</p><p>
	For these exercises, our test environment consisted of a SUSE 8.2 Professional Linux Workstation running
	VMWare 3.2. The following VMWare images were prepared:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Windows 98  name: MILGATE98.</p></li><li><p>Windows Me  name: WINEPRESSME.</p></li><li><p>Windows XP Professional  name: LightrayXP.</p></li><li><p>Samba-3.0.2 running on a SUSE Enterprise Linux 8.0 machine.</p></li></ul></div><p>
	Choose a workgroup name (MIDEARTH) for each exercise.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2507224"></a>
	The network captures provided on the CD-ROM at the back of this book were captured using <tt class="constant">ethereal</tt>
	version <tt class="literal">0.9.10</tt>. A later version suffices without problems, but an earlier version may not
	expose all the information needed. Each capture file has been decoded and listed as a trace file. A summary of all
	packets has also been included. This makes it possible for you to do all the studying you like without the need to
	perform the time-consuming equipment configuration and test work. This is a good time to point out the value
	that can be derived from this book really does warrant your taking sufficient time to practice each exercise with
	care and attention to detail.

		From the packet trace, it should be noted that no messages were propagated over TCP/IP;
		all employed UDP/IP.  When steady state operation has been achieved, there is a cycle
		of various announcements, re-election of a browse master, and name queries. These create
		the symphony of announcements by which network browsing is made possible.

		The <tt class="constant">IPC$</tt> share serves a vital purpose<sup>[<a name="id2508632" href="#ftn.id2508632">1</a>]</sup> 
		in SMB/CIFS based networking.  A Windows client connects to this resource to obtain the list of 
		resources that are available on the server. The server responds with the shares and print queues that
		are available. In most but not all cases, the connection is made with a <tt class="constant">NULL</tt>
		username and a <tt class="constant">NULL</tt> password.
		</p><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2508651"></a>
		The two packets examined are material evidence with respect to how Windows clients may
		interoperate with Samba. Samba requires every connection setup to be authenticated using
		valid UNIX account credentials (UID/GID). This means that even a <tt class="constant">NULL</tt>
		session setup can be established only by automatically mapping it to a valid UNIX
		account.
		</p><p>
	    <a class="indexterm" name="id2508671"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2508677"></a>
	    <a class="indexterm" name="id2508686"></a>
		Samba has a special name for the <tt class="constant">NULL</tt>, or empty, user account.
		It calls that the <a class="indexterm" name="id2508698"></a>guest account. The
		default value of this parameter is <tt class="constant">nobody</tt>; however, this can be
		changed to map the function of the guest account to any other UNIX identity. Some
		UNIX administrators prefer to map this account to the system default anonymous
		FTP account. A sample NULL Session Setup AndX packet dissection is shown in
		<a href="primer.html#nullconnect" title="Figure 1.4. Typical Windows 9x/Me NULL SessionSetUp AndX Request">???</a>.

		<a class="indexterm" name="id2508773"></a>

		When a UNIX/Linux system does not have a <tt class="constant">nobody</tt> user account
		(<tt class="filename">/etc/passwd</tt>), the operation of the <tt class="constant">NULL</tt>
		account cannot validate and thus connections that utilize the guest account
		fail. This breaks all ability to browse the Samba server and is a common
		problem reported on the Samba mailing list. A sample User Mode Session Setup AndX
		is shown in <a href="primer.html#userconnect" title="Figure 1.5. Typical Windows 9x/Me User SessionSetUp AndX Request">???</a>.

	By now you may be asking, &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Why did you choose to work with Windows 9x/Me?</em></span></span>&#8221;
	</p><p>
	First, we want to demonstrate the simple case. This book is not intended to be a detailed treatise
	on the Windows networking protocols, but rather to provide prescriptive guidance for deployment of Samba.
	Second, by starting out with the simple protocol, it can be demonstrated that the more complex case mostly
	follows the same principles.
	</p><p>
	The following exercise demonstrates the case that even MS Windows XP Professional with up-to-date service
	updates also uses the <tt class="constant">NULL</tt> account, as well as user accounts. Simply follow the procedure
	to complete this exercise.
	</p><p>
	To complete this exercise, you need a Windows XP Professional client that has been configured as
	a Domain Member of either a Samba controlled domain or a Windows NT4 or 200x Active Directory domain.
	Here we do not provide details for how to configure this, as full coverage is provided later in this book.
	</p><div class="procedure"><ol type="1"><li><p>
		Start your Domain Controller. Also, start the ethereal monitoring machine, launch ethereal,
		and then wait for the next step to complete.
		</p></li><li><p>
		Start the Windows XP Client and wait five minutes before proceeding.
		</p></li><li><p>
		On the machine from which network activity will be monitored (using <span><b class="command">ethereal</b></span>),
                launch <span><b class="command">ethereal</b></span> and click
                        <span class="guimenu">Capture</span>-&gt;<span class="guimenuitem">Start</span>.
                </p><p>

                Click <span class="guibutton">OK</span>.
		</p></li><li><p>
		On the Windows XP Professional client: Press <span class="guimenu">Ctrl-Alt-Delete</span> to bring 
		up the domain logon screen. Log in using valid credentials for a domain user account.
		</p></li><li><p>
		Now proceed to connect to the Domain Controller as follows:
		<span class="guimenu">Start</span>-&gt;<span class="guimenuitem">(right-click) My Network Places</span>-&gt;<span class="guimenuitem">Explore</span>-&gt;<span class="guimenuitem">{Left Panel} [+] Entire Network</span>-&gt;<span class="guimenuitem">{Left Panel} [+] Microsoft Windows Network</span>-&gt;<span class="guimenuitem">{Left Panel} [+] Midearth</span>-&gt;<span class="guimenuitem">{Left Panel} [+] Frodo</span>-&gt;<span class="guimenuitem">{Left Panel} [+] data</span>. Close the explorer window.
		</p><p>
		In this step, our domain name is <tt class="constant">Midearth</tt>, the domain controller is called
		<tt class="constant">Frodo</tt>, and we have connected to a share called <tt class="constant">data</tt>.
		</p></li><li><p>
		Stop the capture on the <span><b class="command">ethereal</b></span> monitoring machine. Be sure to save the captured data
		to a file so that you can refer to it again later.
		</p></li><li><p>
		If desired, the Windows XP Professional client and the Domain Controller are no longer needed for exercises
		in this chapter.

		This exercise demonstrates that, while the specific protocol for the Session Setup AndX is handled
		in a more sophisticated manner by recent MS Windows clients, the underlying rules or principles
		remain the same. Thus it is demonstrated  that MS Windows XP Professional clients still use a 
		<tt class="constant">NULL-Session</tt> connection to query and locate resources on an advanced network
		technology server (one using Windows NT4/200x or Samba). It also demonstrates that an authenticated
		connection must be made before resources can be used.

	In summary, the following points have been established in this chapter:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
		When NetBIOS over TCP/IP protocols are enabled, MS Windows networking employs broadcast
		oriented messaging protocols to provide knowledge of network services.
		</p></li><li><p>
		Network browsing protocols query information stored on Browse Masters that manage
		information provided by NetBIOS Name Registrations and by way of on-going Host 
		Announcements and Workgroup Announcements.
		</p></li><li><p>
		All Samba servers must be configured with a mechanism for mapping the <tt class="constant">NULL-Session</tt>
		to a valid but non-privileged UNIX system account.
		</p></li><li><p>
		The use of Microsoft encrypted passwords is built right into the fabric of Windows
		networking operations. Such passwords cannot be provided from the UNIX <tt class="filename">/etc/passwd</tt>
		database and thus must be stored elsewhere on the UNIX system in a manner that Samba can
		use. Samba-2.x permitted such encrypted passwords to be stored in the <tt class="constant">smbpasswd</tt>
		file or in an LDAP database. Samba-3 permits that use of multiple different <i class="parameter"><tt>passdb backend</tt></i>
		databases, in concurrent deploy. Refer to <span class="emphasis"><em>TOSHARG</em></span>, Chapter 10, &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Account Information Databases.</em></span></span>&#8221;

		Yes, there are two ways to do this. The first involves use of WINS (See <span class="emphasis"><em>TOSHARG</em></span>, Chapter 9, 
		Section 9.5, &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>WINS  The Windows Inter-networking Name Server</em></span></span>&#8221;), the
		alternate method involves disabling the use of NetBIOS over TCP/IP. This second method requires
		a correctly configured DNS server (see <span class="emphasis"><em>TOSHARG</em></span>, Chapter 9, Section 9.3, &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Discussion</em></span></span>&#8221;).

		<a class="indexterm" name="id2509923"></a>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2509933"></a>
		The use of WINS reduces network broadcast traffic. The reduction is greatest when all network 
		clients are configured to operate in <i class="parameter"><tt>Hybrid Mode</tt></i>. This can be effected through 
		use of DHCP to set the NetBIOS node type to type 8 for all network clients. Additionally, it is 
		beneficial to configure Samba to use <a class="indexterm" name="id2509950"></a>name resolve order = wins host 
		bcast.
		</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>

		Can I just use plain-text passwords with Samba?
		</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"><b></b></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
		Yes, you can configure Samba to use plain-text passwords, though this does create a few problems.
		</p><p>
		First, the use of <tt class="filename">/etc/passwd</tt> based plain-text passwords requires that registry
		modifications be made on all MS Windows client machines to enable plain-text passwords support. This
		significantly diminishes the security of MS Windows client operation. Many network administrators
		are bitterly opposed to doing this.
		</p><p>
		Second, Microsoft has not maintained plain-text password support since the default setting was made
		disabling this. When network connections are dropped by the client it is not be possible to re-establish
		the connection automatically. Users need to log off and then log on again. Plain-text password support
		may interfere with recent enhancements that are part of the Microsoft move toward a more secure computing
		environment. 
		</p><p>
		Samba-3 supports Microsoft encrypted passwords. Be advised not to reintroduce plain-text password handling. 
		Just create user accounts by running: <span><b class="command">smbpasswd -a 'username'</b></span>
		</p><p>
		It is not possible to add a user to the <i class="parameter"><tt>passdb backend</tt></i> database unless there is
		a UNIX system account for that user. On systems that run <span><b class="command">winbindd</b></span> to access the Samba
		PDC/BDC to provide Windows user and group accounts, the <i class="parameter"><tt>idmap uid, idmap gid</tt></i> ranges
		set in the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file provide the local UID/GIDs needed for local identity management purposes.

		Yes. This is a local function on the server. The default setting is to use the UNIX account
		<tt class="constant">nobody</tt>. If this account does not exist on the UNIX server, then it is
		necessary to provide a <a class="indexterm" name="id2510150"></a>guest account = an_account,
