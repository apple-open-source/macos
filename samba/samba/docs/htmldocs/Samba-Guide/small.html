	So far, this book has focused on the basics of simple yet effective
	network solutions. Network administrators who take pride in their work 
	(that's most of us, right?) take care to deliver what our users want, 
	but not too much more. If we make things too complex, we confound our users and 
	increase costs of network ownership. A professional network manager 
	avoids the temptation to put too much pizazz into the way that the network 
	operates. Some creativity is helpful, but do keep it under control.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2514988"></a>
	Five years ago there were two companies from which a lesson can be learned.	
	In one case the network administrator spent three months building a new
	network to replace an old Netware server. What he delivered had all the
	bells and whistles he could muster. There were a few teething problems
	during the change-over, nothing serious but a little disruptive all the
	same. Users were exposed to many changes at once. The network
	administrator was asked to resign two months after implementing the
	new system. This was necessary because so many staff had complained
	they had lost time and were not happy with the new network.
	Everything was automated and he delivered more features than any advanced
	user could think of. He was just too smart for his own good.
	</p><p>
	In the case of the other company, a new network manager was appointed
	to oversee the replacement of a LanTastic network with an MS Windows
	NT 4.0 network. He had the replacement installed and operational within
	two weeks. Before installation and change-over, he called a meeting to
	explain to all users what was going to happen, how it would affect them
	and that he would be available 24 hours a day to help them transition.
	One week after conversion, he held another meeting asking for cooperation
	in the introduction of a few new features that would help to make life
	easier. Network users were thrilled with what he was doing to help
	them. The network he implemented was nowhere near as complex as the first example, had fewer
	features, and yet he had happy users. Months later he was still adding
	new innovations. He always asked the users if a
	particular feature was what they wanted. He asked his boss for a raise
	and got it. He often told me, &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>Always keep a few new tricks up your
	sleeves for when you need them.</em></span></span>&#8221; Was he smart? You decide. Let's
	get on with our next exercise.
	</p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2515052"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
	Abmas Accounting Inc. has grown. Mr. Meany likes you and says he knew you
	were the right person for the job. That's why he asked you to install the
	new server. The past few months have been hard work. You advised Mr. Meany
	that it is time for a change. Abmas now has 52 users, having acquired an
	investment consulting business recently. The new users were added to the
	network without any problems.
	</p><p>
	Some of the Windows clients are getting to be past their use-by date. 
	You have found damaged and unusable software on some of the workstations
	that came with the acquired business and found some machines that are 
	in need of both hardware and software maintenance. 
	</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2515076"></a>Assignment Tasks</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2515084"></a>
		Mr. Meany has decided to retire in 12 months. He wants you to help him
		make the business run better. Many of the new staff want notebook computers.
		They visit customer business premises with the need to use local network
		facilities; these users are technically competent. The company uses a
		business application that requires Windows XP Professional. In short, a
		complete client upgrade is about to happen. Mr. Meany told you that he is working
		on another business acquisition and that by the time he retires there will be
		80 to 100 users.
		</p><p>
		Mr. Meany is not concerned about security. He wants to make it easier for
		staff to do their work. He has hired you to help him appoint a full-time
		network manager before he retires. Above all, he says he is investing in
		the ability to grow. He is determined to live his lifelong dream and
		hand the business over to a bright and capable executive who can make
		things happen. This means your network design must cope well with
		growth.
		</p><p>
		In a few months, Abmas will require an Internet connection for email
		and so staff easily obtain software updates. Mr. Meany is warming up to the
		installation of anti-virus software, but is not yet ready to approve
		this expense. He told you to spend the money a virus scanner costs
		on better quality notebook computers for mobile users.
		</p><p>
		One of Mr. Meany's golfing partners sold him on the idea to buy new laser
		printers. One black only, the other a color laser printer. Staff support
		the need for a color printer so they can present more attractive proposals
		and reports.
		</p><p>
		Mr. Meany also asked if it would be possible for one of the staff to manage
		user accounts from the Windows desktop. That person will be responsible for
		basic operations.
		</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2515137"></a>Dissection and Discussion</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
	What are the key requirements in this business example? A quick review indicates
	a need for:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
		Scalability  from 52 to over 100 users in 12 months
		</p></li><li><p>
		Mobile computing capability

		</p></li><li><p>
		Improved reliability and usability
		</p></li><li><p>
		Easier administration
		</p></li></ul></div><p>
	In this instance the installed Linux system is assumed to be a Red Hat Linux 9.0 server 
	(as in <a href="simple.html#AccountingOffice" title="Accounting Office">???</a>).

		It is time to implement a domain security environment. You will use the <tt class="constant">
		smbpasswd</tt> (default) backend. You should implement a DHCP server. There is no need to
		run DNS at this time, but the system will use WINS. The Domain name will be <tt class="constant">
		BILLMORE</tt>. This time, the name of the server will be <tt class="constant">SLEETH</tt>.
		</p><p>
		All printers will be configured as DHCP clients. The DHCP server will assign 
		the printer a fixed IP address by way of its Ethernet interface (MAC) address.
		See <a href="small.html#dhcp01" title="Example 3.2. Abmas Accounting DHCP Server Configuration File  /etc/dhcpd.conf">???</a>.
                </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
		The <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file you are creating in this exercise can be used with equal effectiveness
		with Samba-2.2.x series releases. This is deliberate so that in the next chapter it is
		possible to start with the installation that you have created here, migrate it
		to a Samba-3 configuration and then secure the system further. Configurations following
		this one will utilize features that may not be supported in Samba-2.2.x releases.
		However, you should note that the examples in each chapter start with the assumption
		that a fresh new installation is being effected.
		</p></div><p>
		Later on, when the Internet connection is implemented, you will add DNS as well as
		other enhancements. It is important that you plan accordingly.
		</p><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2515292"></a>
		You have split the network into two separate areas. Each has its own ether-switch.
		There are 20 users on the accounting network and 32 users on the financial services
		network. The server has two network interfaces, one serving each network. The 
		network printers will be located in a central area. You plan to install the new 
		printers and keep the old printer in use also.
		</p><p>
		You will provide separate file storage areas for each business entity. The old system
		will go away, accounting files will be handled under a single directory, and files will
		be stored under customer name, not under a personal work area. Staff will be made
		responsible for file location, so maintain the old share point.
		</p><p>
		Given that DNS will not be used, you will configure WINS name resolution for UNIX 
		hostname name resolution.
		</p><p>

		It is necessary to map Windows Domain Groups to UNIX groups as a minimum. It is
		advisable to also map Windows Local Groups to UNIX groups. Additionally, the two
		key staff groups in the firm are Accounting Staff and Financial Services Staff.
		For these, it is necessary to create UNIX groups as well as Windows Domain Groups.
		</p><p>
		In the sample <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file, you have configured Samba to call the UNIX <span><b class="command">groupadd</b></span>
		to add group entries. This utility does not permit the addition of group names that
		contain upper-case characters or spaces. This is considered a bug. The <span><b class="command">groupadd</b></span>
		is part of the <span><b class="command">shadow-utils</b></span> Open Source Software package.
		A later release of this package may have been patched to resolve this bug.
		If your operating platform has this bug, it means that attempts to add a Windows Domain
		Group that has either a space or upper-case characters in it will fail. See <span class="emphasis"><em>TOSHARG</em></span>, Section 11.3.1,
		Example 11.1, for more information.
		</p><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2515390"></a>
		Vendor-supplied printer drivers will be installed on each client. The CUPS print spooler
		on the UNIX host will be operated in <tt class="constant">raw</tt> mode.

		Mr. Meany is an old-school manager. He sets the rules and wants to see compliance.
		He is willing to spend money on things he believes are of value. You need more
		time to convince him of real priorities.
		</p><p>
		Go ahead, buy better notebooks. Wouldn't it be neat if they happened to be
		supplied with anti-virus software? Above all, demonstrate good purchase value and remember
		to make your users happy.
		</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2515426"></a>Implementation</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2515433"></a>
	In this example, the assumption is made that this server is being configured from a clean start.
	The alternate approach could be to demonstrate the migration of the system that is documented
	in <a href="simple.html#AcctgNet" title="Implementation">???</a> to meet the new requirements. The decision to treat this case, as with
	future examples, as a new installation is based on the premise that you can determine
	the migration steps from the information provided in the separate chapter on this subject.
	Additionally, a fresh installation makes the example easier to follow.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2515459"></a>
	Each user will be given a home directory on the UNIX system, which will be available as a private
	share. Two additional shares will be created, one for the Accounting Department and the other for
	the Financial Services Department. Network users will be given access to these shares by way
	of group membership.
	</p><p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="id2515477"></a>
	UNIX group membership is the primary mechanism by which Windows Domain users will be granted
	rights and privileges within the Windows environment.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2515491"></a>
	The user <span><b class="command">alanm</b></span> will be made the owner of all files. This will be preserved
	by setting the sticky bit (set UID/GID) on the top-level directories.

		Given that Samba will be operating over two network interfaces and clients on each side
		may want to be able to reach clients on the other side, it is imperative that IP forwarding
		shall be enabled. Use the system tool of your choice to enable IP forwarding. In the
		absence of such a tool on the Linux system, add to the <tt class="filename">/etc/rc.d/rc.local</tt>
		file an entry as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
</pre><p>
		This causes the Linux kernel to forward IP packets so that it acts as a router.
		</p></li><li><p>
		Install the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file as shown in <a href="small.html#acct2conf" title="Example 3.3. Accounting Office Network smb.conf File  [globals] Section">???</a> and 
		<a href="small.html#acct3conf" title="Example 3.4. Accounting Office Network smb.conf File  Services and Shares Section">???</a>. Combine these two examples to form a single
		<tt class="filename">/etc/samba/smb.conf</tt> file.
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2515717"></a>
		Add the user <span><b class="command">root</b></span> to the Samba password backend:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> smbpasswd -a root
New SMB password: XXXXXXX
Retype new SMB password: XXXXXXX
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt>
</pre><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2515751"></a>
		This is the Windows Domain Administrator password. Never delete this account from
		the password backend after Windows Domain Groups have been initialized. If you delete
		this account, your system is crippled. You cannot restore this account
		and your Samba server is no longer capable of being administered.
		</p></li><li><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2515770"></a>
		Create the username map file to permit the <tt class="constant">root</tt> account to be called 
		<tt class="constant">Administrator</tt> from the Windows network environment. To do this, create
		the file <tt class="filename">/etc/samba/smbusers</tt> with the following contents:
</p><pre class="screen">

# File Format
# -----------
# Unix_ID = Windows_ID

			Verify that the printers have the IP addresses assigned in the DHCP server configuration file.
			The easiest way to do this is to ping the printer name. Immediately after the ping response
			has been received, execute <span><b class="command">arp -a</b></span> to find the MAC address of the printer
			that has responded. Now you can compare the IP address and the MAC address of the printer
			with the configuration information in the <tt class="filename">/etc/dhcpd.conf</tt> file. They
			should, of course, match. For example:
</p><pre class="screen">

	As a network administrator, you already know how to create local machine accounts for Windows 200x/XP
	Professional systems. This is the preferred solution to provide continuity of work for notebook users
	so that absence from the office network environment does not become a barrier to productivity.
	</p><p>
	By creating a local machine account that has the same user name and password as you create for that
	user in the Windows Domain environment, the user can log onto the machine locally and still
	transparently access network resources as if logged onto the domain itself. There are some trade-offs
	that mean that as the network is more tightly secured it becomes necessary to modify Windows client
	configuration somewhat.

		and implemented several important aspects of Windows networking. In the next chapter of this book,
		you build on the experience gained. These are the highlights from this chapter:

		First and foremost, portability. It means that notebook users can move between
		the Abmas office and client offices (so long as they, too, use DHCP) without having to manually
		reconfigure their machines. It also means that when they work from their home environments
		either using DHCP assigned addressing or when using dial-up networking, settings such as
		default routes and DNS server addresses that apply only to the Abmas office environment do
		not interfere with remote operations. This is an extremely important feature of DHCP.

		</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"><b></b></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
		Yes. The configuration you created automatically provides each client with the IP address
		of your WINS server. It also configures the client to preferentially register NetBIOS names
		with the WINS server, and then instructs the client to first query the WINS server when a
		NetBIOS machine name needs to be resolved to an IP Address. This means that this configuration
		results in far lower UDP broadcast traffic than would be the case if WINS was not used.

		Is it possible to create a Windows Domain account that is specifically called <tt class="constant">Administrator</tt>?
		</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"><b></b></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
		You can surely create a Windows Domain Account called <tt class="constant">Administrator</tt>. It is also
		possible to map that account so that it has the effective UNIX UID of 0. This way it isn't
		necessary to use the <i class="parameter"><tt>username map</tt></i> facility to map this account to the UNIX
		account called <tt class="constant">root</tt>.

		</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"><b></b></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
		The Windows Domain <tt class="constant">Administrator</tt> account is the most privileged account that
		exists on the Windows platform. This user can change any setting, add/delete or modify user
		accounts, and completely reconfigure the system. The equivalent to this account in the UNIX
		environment is the <tt class="constant">root</tt> account. If you want to permit the Windows Domain
		Administrator to manage accounts, as well as permissions, privileges, and security
		settings within the Domain and on the Samba server, equivalent rights must be assigned. This is
		achieved with the <tt class="constant">root</tt> UID equal to 0.

		Users who are members of the <tt class="constant">Domain Admins</tt> group can add machines to the
		Domain. This group is mapped to the UNIX group account called <tt class="constant">root</tt>
		(or equivalent on <tt class="constant">wheel</tt> on some UNIX systems) that has a GID of 0.
		This must be the primary GID of the account of the user who is a member of the Windows <tt class="constant">

		Samba-3 does not permit a Domain Group to become visible to Domain network clients unless the account

		</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"><b></b></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
		The group called <span class="guimenu">Administrators</span> is representative of the same account that would be
		present as the Local Group account on a Domain Member server or workstation. Samba uses only Domain 
		Groups at this time. A Workstation or Server Local Group has no meaning in a Samba context. This
		may change at some later date. These accounts are provided only so that security objects are correctly shown.

		What is the effect of changing the name of a Samba server, or of changing the Domain name?
		</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"><b></b></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
		In the event that you elect to change the name of the Samba server, on restarting <span><b class="command">smbd</b></span>,
		Windows security identifiers are changed. In the case of a Stand-Alone server or a Domain Member server,
		the machine SID is changed. This may break Domain Membership. In the case of a change of the Domain name
		(Workgroup name), the Domain SID is changed. This affects all Domain Memberships.
		</p><p>
		If it becomes necessary to change either the Server name or the Domain name, be sure to back up the respective
		SID before the change is made. You can back up the SID from use of the <span><b class="command">net getlocalsid</b></span> (Samba-3),
		or by way of the <span><b class="command">smbpasswd</b></span> (Samba-2.2.x). To change the SID, you use the same tool. Be sure
		to check the man page for this command for detailed instructions regarding the steps involved.

		Samba-3 implements a Windows NT4 style security domain architecture. This type of Domain cannot
		be managed using tools present on a Windows XP Professional installation. You may download from the
		Microsoft Web site the SRVTOOLS.EXE package. Extract it into the directory from which you wish to use
		it. This package extracts the tools known as: <span><b class="command">User Manager for Domains, Server Manager, Event
		Viewer</b></span>. You may use the <span class="guimenu">User Manager for Domains</span> to manage your Samba-3
		Domain user and group accounts. Of course, you do need to be logged on as the <tt class="constant">Administrator</tt>
		for the Samba-3 Domain. It may help to log on as the <tt class="constant">root</tt> account.
