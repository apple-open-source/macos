	<span class="emphasis"><em>Samba-3 by Example Cover Artwork:</em></span> King Alfred the Great 
	(born 849, ruled 871-899) was one of the most amazing kings ever to 
	rule England. He defended Anglo-Saxon England from Viking raids, formulated 
	a code of laws, and fostered a rebirth of religious and scholarly activity. 
	His reign exhibits military skill and innovation, sound governance and the 
	ability to inspire men to plan for the future. Alfred liberated England
	at a time when all resistence seemed futile.
