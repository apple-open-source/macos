	By this point in the book, you have been exposed to many Samba-3 features and capabilities.
	More importantly, if you have implemented the examples given, you are well on your way to becoming 
	a Samba-3 networking guru who knows a lot about Microsoft Windows. If you have taken the time to 
	practice, you likely have thought of improvements and scenarios with which you can experiment. You 
	are rather well plugged in to the many flexible ways Samba can be used.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2559248"></a>
	This is a book about Samba-3. Understandably, its intent is to present it in a positive light. 
	The casual observer might conclude that this book is one-eyed about Samba. It is  what 
	would you expect? This chapter exposes some criticisms that have been raised concerning 
	the use of Samba. For each criticism, there are good answers and appropriate solutions.
	</p><p>
	Some criticism always comes from deep inside ranks that one would expect to be supportive of a particular 
	decision. Criticism can be expected from the outside. Let's see how the interesting dynamic of 
	criticism develops with respect to Abmas.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2559276"></a>
	This chapter provides a shameless self-promotion of Samba-3. The objections raised were not pulled
	out of thin air. They were drawn from comments made by Samba users and from criticism during 
	discussions with Windows network administrators. The tone of the objections reflects as closely 
	as possible that of the original. The case presented is a straw-man example that is designed to 
	permit each objection to be answered as it might occur in real life.

	Abmas is continuing its meteoric growth with yet further acquisitions. The investment community took
	note of the spectacular projection of Abmas onto the global business stage. Abmas is building an
	interesting portfolio of companies that includes accounting services, financial advice, investment
	portfolio management, property insurance, risk assessment, and the recent addition of a a video rental
	business. The pieces do not always appear to fit together, but Mr. Meany is certainly executing an 
	interesting business growth and development plan. Abmas Video Rentals has been recently acquired. 
	During the time that the acquisition was closing, the Video Rentals business upgraded their Windows 
	NT4-based network to Windows 2003 Server and Active Directory.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2559356"></a>
	Bob Jordan has been accepting of the fact that Abmas Video Rentals will use Microsoft Active Directory.
	The IT team led by Stan Soroka is committed to Samba-3 and to maintaining a uniform technology platform. 
	Stan Soroka's team voiced their disapproval over the decision to permit this business to continue to 
	operate with a solution that is viewed by Christine and her group as &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>an island of broken 
	technologies.</em></span></span>&#8221; This comment was made by one of Christine's staff as they were installing a new 
	Samba-3 server at the new business.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2559381"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2559389"></a>
	Abmas Video Rentals' head of IT heard of this criticism. He was offended that a junior engineer
	should make such a comment. He felt that he had to prepare in case he might be criticized for his 
	decision to use Active Directory. He decided he would defend his decision by hiring the services 
	of an outside security systems consultant to report<sup>[<a name="id2559404" href="#ftn.id2559404">12</a>]</sup> on his unit's operations 
	and to investigate the role of Samba at his site. Here are key extracts from this hypothetical 
	report:

	... the implementation of Microsoft Active Directory at the Abmas Video Rentals, Bamingsham site,
	 has been examined. We find no evidence to support a notion that vulnerabilities exist at your site.  
	... we took additional steps to validate the integrity of the installation and operation of Active 
	Directory and are pleased that your staff are following sound practices.

	User and Group accounts, and respective privileges, have been well thought out. File system shares are
	appropriately secured. Backup and disaster recovery plans are well managed and validated regularly, and
	effective off-site storage practices are considered to exceed industry norms.

	The recently installed Linux file and application server uses a tool called <span><b class="command">winbind</b></span> 
	that is indiscriminate about security. All user accounts in Active Directory can be used to access data 
	stored on the Linux system. We are alarmed that secure information is accessible to staff who should 
	not even be aware that it exists. We share the concerns of your network management staff who have gone 
	to great lengths to set fine-grained controls that limit information access to those who need access. 
	It seems incongruous to us that Samba winbind should be permitted to be used as it voids this fine work.

	In respect of the use of Samba, we offer the following comments: Samba is in use in nearly half of
	all sites we have surveyed. ... It is our opinion that Samba offers no better security than Microsoft
	... what worries us regarding Samba is the need to disable essential Windows security features such as
	secure channel support, digital sign'n'seal on all communication traffic, running Active Directory in
	mixed mode so that Samba clients and servers can authenticate all of it. Additionally, we are concerned that
	Samba is not at the full capabilites of Microsoft Windows NT4 server. Microsoft has moved well beyond that
	with trusted computing initiatives that the Samba developers do not participate in.

	One wonders about the integrity of an open source program that is developed by a team of hackers 
	who cannot be held accountable for the flaws in their code. The sheer number of updates and bug
	fixes they have released should ring alarm bells in any business.

	Another factor that should be considered is that buying Microsoft products and services helps to 
	provide employment in the IT industry. Samba and Open Source software place those jobs at risk.

	This is also a challenge to rise above the trouble spot.  Bob calls Stan's team together for a simple 
	discussion, but it gets further out of hand.  When he returns to his office, he finds the following 
	email in his in-box:
	</p><p>
	Bob,

	I apologize for the leak of internal discussions to the new business. It reflects poorly on our 
	professionalism and has put you in an unpleasant position. I regret the incident.
	</p><p>
	I also wish to advise that two of the recent recruits want to implement Kerberos authentication 
	across all systems. I concur with the desire to improve security. One of the new guys who is championing
	the move to Kerberos was responsible for the comment that caused the embarrassment.

	I am experiencing difficulty in handling the sharp push for Kerberos. He claims that Kerberos, OpenLDAP, 
	plus Samba-3 will seamlessly replace Microsoft Active Directory. I am a little out of my depth with respect 
	to the feasibility of such a move, but have taken steps to pull both of them into line. With your consent, 
	I would like to hire the services of a well-known Samba consultant to set the record straight.

	I intend to use this report to answer the criticism raised and would like to establish a policy that we
	will approve the use of Microsoft Windows Servers (and Active Directory) subject to all costs being covered 
	out of the budget of the division that wishes to go its own way. I propose that dissenters will still remain
	responsible to meet the budgeted contribution to IT operations as a whole. I believe we should not coerce 
	use of any centrally proposed standards, but make all non-compliance the financial responsibility of the 
	out-of-step division. Hopefully, this will encourage all divisions to walk with us and not alone.

	Samba-3 is a tool. No one pounding your door to use Samba. That is a choice that you are free to 
	make or reject. It is likely that your decision to use Samba can benefit your company more than 
	anyone else. The Samba Team obviously believes that the Samba software is a worthy choice. 
	If you hire a consultant to assist with the installation and/or deployment of Samba, or if you hire 
	someone to help manage your Samba installation, you can create income and employment. Alternately, 
	money saved by not spending in the IT area can be spent elsewhere in the business. All money saved 
	or spent creates employment.

	In the long term, the use of Samba must be economically sustainable. In some situations, Samba is adopted
	purely to provide file and print service interoperability on platforms that otherwise cannot provide 
	access to data and to printers for Microsoft Windows clients. Samba is used by some businesses to
	effect a reduction in the cost of providing IT services. Obviously, it is also used by some as an 
	alternative to the use of a Microsoft file and print serving platforms with no consideration of costs.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2560080"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560088"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560096"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560104"></a>
	It would be foolish to adopt a technology that might put any data or users at risk. Security affects 
	everyone. The Samba Team are fully cognizant of the responsibility they have to their users. 
	The Samba documentation clearly reveals the fact that full responsibility is accepted to fix anything 
	that is broken.

	There is a mistaken perception in the IT industry that commercial software providers are fully 
	accountable for the defects in products. Open Source software comes with no warranty, so it is 
	often assumed that its use confers a higher degree of risk. Everyone should read commercial software 
	End User License Agreements (EULAs). You should determine what real warranty is offered and the 
	extent of liability that is accepted. Doing so soon dispels the popular notion that
	commercial software vendors are willingly accountable for product defects. In many cases, the
	commercial vendor accepts liability only to reimburse the price paid for the software. 
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2560225"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560233"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560241"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560249"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560257"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560265"></a>
	The real issues that a consumer (like you) needs answered is what is the way of escape from technical 
	problems and how long will it take? The average problem turnaround time in the Open Source community is 
	approximately 48 hours. What does the EULA offer? What is the track record in the commercial software 
	industry? What happens when your commercial vendor decides to cease providing support?
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2560289"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560297"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560305"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560313"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560321"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560329"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560336"></a>
	Open Source software at least puts you in possession of the source code. This means that when
	all else fails, you can hire a programmer to solve/fix the problem.

				Windows network administrators may be dismayed to find that <span><b class="command">winbind</b></span> 
				exposes all Domain users so that they may use their Domain account credentials to 
				log onto a UNIX/Linux system. The fact that all users in the Domain can see the 
				UNIX/Linux server in their Network Neighborhood and can browse the shares on the 
				server seems to excite them further.
				</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2560468"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560477"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560484"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560492"></a>
				<span><b class="command">winbind</b></span> provides for the UNIX/Linux Domain Member server or 
				client, the same as one would obtain by adding a Microsoft Windows server or 
				client to the Domain. The real objection is the fact that Samba is not MS Windows 
				and, therefore, requires handling a little differently from the familiar Windows systems.
				One must recognize fear of the unknown.
				</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2560515"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560524"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560531"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560539"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560547"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560559"></a>
				Windows network administrators need to recognize that <span><b class="command">winbind</b></span> does
				not, and cannot, override account controls set using the Active Directory management
				tools. The control is the same. Have no fear.
				</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2560579"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560587"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560598"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560606"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560614"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560622"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560630"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560638"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560646"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560654"></a>
				Where Samba and the ADS Domain account information obtained through the use of
				<span><b class="command">winbind</b></span> permits access, by browsing or by the drive mapping to
				a share, to data that should be better protected. This can only happen when security
				controls have not been properly implemented. Samba permits access controls to be set
				on:
				</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Shares themselves (i.e., the logical share itself)</p></li><li><p>The share definition in <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt></p></li><li><p>The shared directories and files using UNIX permissions</p></li><li><p>Using Windows 2000 ACLs  if the file system is Posix enabled</p></li></ul></div><p>
				Examples of each are given in <a href="kerberos.html#ch10expl" title="Implementation">???</a>.
				</p></dd><dt><span class="term">User and Group Controls</span></dt><dd><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2560727"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560736"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560747"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560758"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560766"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560774"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560782"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560789"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560797"></a>
				User and group management facilities as known in the Windows ADS environment may be
				used to provide equivalent access control constraints or to provide equivalent
				permissions and privileges on Samba servers. Samba offers greater flexibility in the
				use of user and group controls because it has additional layers of control compared to
				Windows 200x/XP. For example, access controls on a Samba server may be set within
				the share definition in a manner for which Windows has no equivalent.
				</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2560817"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560825"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560833"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560841"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560852"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560860"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560868"></a>
				In any serious analysis of system security, it is important to examine the safeguards
				that remain when all other protective measures fail. An administrator may inadvertently
				set excessive permissions on the file system of a shared resource, or he may set excessive
				privileges on the share itself. If that were to happen in a Windows 2003 Server environment,
				the data would indeed be laid bare to abuse. Yet, within a Samba share definition, it is
				possible to guard against that by enforcing controls on the share definition itself. You
				see a practical example of this a little later in this chapter.
				</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2560890"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560898"></a>
				The report that is critical of Samba really ought to have exercised greater due
				diligence, as the real weakness is on the side of a Microsoft Windows environment.
				</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Security Overall</span></dt><dd><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2560920"></a>
				Samba has been designed in such a manner that weaknesses inherent in the design of
				Microsoft Windows networking ought not to expose the underlying UNIX/Linux file
				system in any way. All software has potential defects, and Samba is no exception.
				What matters more is how defects that are discovered get dealt with.
				</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2560942"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560950"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560958"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2560966"></a>
				The Samba Team totally agrees with the necessity to observe and fully implement
				every security facility to provide a level of protection and security that is necessary
				and that the end user (or network administrator) needs. Never would the Samba Team
				recommend a compromise to system security, nor would deliberate defoliation of

				The report condemns Samba for releasing updates and security fixes, yet Microsoft
				on-line updates need to be applied almost weekly. The answer to the criticism made 
				lies in the fact that Samba development is continuing, documentation is improving, 
				user needs are being increasingly met or exceeded, and security updates are issued 
				with a short turnaround time.

				The release of Samba-4 is expected around late 2004 to early 2005 and involves a near 
				complete rewrite to permit extensive modularization and to prepare Samba for new 
				functionality planned for addition  during the next generation series. The Samba Team 
				is responsible and can be depended upon; the history to date would suggest a high 
				degree of dependability as well as on charter development consistent with published 
				road-map projections.

				Not well published is the fact that Microsoft was a foundation member of
				the Common Internet File System (CIFS) initiative, together with the participation 
				of the network attached storage (NAS) industry. Unfortunately, for the past few years,
				Microsoft has been absent from active involvement at CIFS conferences and has
				not exercised the leadership expected of a major force in the networking technology
				space. The Samba Team has maintained consistent presence and leadership at all
				CIFS conferences and at the interoperability laboratories run concurrently with
				them.

				The report correctly mentions the fact that Samba did not support the most recent
				<tt class="constant">schannel</tt> and <tt class="constant">digital sign'n'seal</tt> features
				of Microsoft Windows NT/200x/XPPro products. This is one of the key features

				It should be pointed out that had clear public specifications for the protocols
				been published, it would have been much easier to implement this and would have
				taken less time to do. The sole mechanism used to find an algorithm that is compatible
				with the methods used by Microsoft has been based on observation of network traffic
				and trial-and-error implementation of potential techniques. The real value of public
				and defensible standards is obvious to all, and would have enabled more secure networking
				for everyone.

				Critics of Samba often ignore fundamental problems that may plague (or may have plagued)
				the users of Microsoft's products also. Those who are first to criticize Samba
				for not rushing into release of <tt class="constant">digital sign'n'seal</tt> support
				often dismiss the problems that Microsoft has 
				<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=321733" target="_top">acknowledged</a>
				and for which a fix was provided. In fact,
				<a href="http://www.tangent-systems.com/support/delayedwrite.html" target="_top">Tangent Systems</a> 
				appears even today<sup>[<a name="id2561352" href="#ftn.id2561352">13</a>]</sup> to not be sure that the problem has been resolved.

				One final comment is warranted. If companies want more secure networking protocols,
				the most effective method by which this can be achieved is by users seeking
				and working together to help define open and publicly refereed standards. The
				development of closed source, proprietary methods that are developed in a
				clandestine framework of secrecy, under claims of digital rights protection, does
				not favor the diffusion of safe networking protocols, and certainly does not
				help the consumer to make a better choice.

				</p><div class="literallayout"><p>    </p></div><p>
				The Microsoft networking protocols extensively make use of remote procedure call (RPC)
				technology. Active Directory is not a simple mixture of LDAP and Kerberos together
				with file and print services, but rather is a complex intertwined implementation
				of them that uses RPCs that are not supported by any of these component technologies
				and yet by which they are made to interoperate in ways that the components do not
				support.

				In order to make the popular request for Samba to be an Active Directory Server a
				reality, it is necessary to add to OpenLDAP, Kerberos, as well as Samba, RPC calls
				that are not presently supported. The Samba Team has not been able to gain critical
				overall support for all project maintainers to work together on the complex
				challenge of developing and integrating the necessary technologies. Therefore, if
				the Samba Team does not make it a priority to absorb Kerberos and LDAP functionality
				into the Samba project, this dream request can not become a reality.

				At this time, the integration of LDAP, Kerberos, and the missing RPCs is not on the

				The Samba Team is most committed to permitting Samba to be a full ADS Domain member

	Kerberos is a network authentication protocol that provides secure authentication for 
	client-server applications by using secret-key cryptography. Firewalls are an insufficient 
	barrier mechanism in todays networking world as at best they only restrict incoming network 
	traffic but can not prevent network traffic that comes from authorized locations from 
	performing unauthorized activities.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2561663"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2561671"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2561678"></a>
	Kerberos was created by MIT as a solution to network security problems. The Kerberos protocol uses 
	strong cryptography so that a client can prove its identity to a server (and vice versa) across an 
	insecure network connection. After a client and server has used Kerberos to prove their identity, 
	they can also encrypt all of their communications to assure privacy and data integrity as they go 
	about their business.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2561697"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2561705"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2561713"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2561720"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2561732"></a>
	Kerberos is a trusted third-party service. That means that there is a third party (the kerberos 
	server) that is trusted by all the entities on the network (users and services, usually called 
	principals). All principals share a secret password (or key) with the kerberos server and this 
	enables principals to verify that the messages from the kerberos server are authentic. Thus 
	trusting the kerberos server, users and services can authenticate each other.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2561751"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2561759"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2561767"></a>
	Kerberos was until recently a technology that was restricted from being exported from the United States.
	For many years that hindered global adoption of more secure networking technologies both within the USA
	as well as outside it. A free an unencumbered implementation of MIT Kerberos has been produced in Europe
	and is available from the University of Paderborn, Sweden. It is known as the Heimdal Kerberos project.
	In recent times the USA government has removed sanctions affecting the global distribution of MIT Kerberos.
	It is likely that there will be a significant surge forward in the development of Kerberos enabled applications
	and in the general deployment and use of Kerberos across the spectrum of the information technology industry.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2561791"></a>
	A storm has broken out concerning interoperability between MIT Kerberos and Microsofts' implementation
	of it. For example, a 2002 new report by <a href="http://www.idg.com.sg/idgwww.nsf/0/5DDA8D153A7505A748256BAB000D992A?OpenDocument" target="_top">IDG</a>
	states:
	</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
	A Microsoft Corp. executive testified at the software giant's remedy hearing that the company goes to 
	great lengths to disclose interfaces and protocols that allow third-party software products to interact 
	with Windows. But a lawyer with the states suing Microsoft pointed out that when it comes to the company's 
	use of the Kerberos authentication specification, not everyone agrees.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2561826"></a>
	Robert Short, vice president of Windows core technology at Microsoft, wrote in his direct testimony prepared 
	before his appearance that non-Microsoft operating systems can disregard the portion of the Kerberos version 
	5 specification that Windows clients use for proprietary purposes and still achieve interoperability with 
	the Microsoft OS. Microsoft takes advantage of unspecified fields in the Kerberos specification for storing 
	Windows-specific authorization data, Short wrote. The designers of Kerberos left these fields undefined so 
	that software developers could add their own authorization information, he said.
	</p></blockquote></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2561851"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2561859"></a>
	It so happens that Microsoft Windows clients depend on and expect the contents of the <span class="emphasis"><em>unspecified
	fields</em></span> in the Kerberos 5 communications data stream for their Windows interoperability, in
	particular when Samba is being expected to emulate a Windows Server 200x Domain Controller. But the interoperability
	issue goes far deeper than this. In the Domain control protocols that are used by MS Windows XP Professional
	there is a tight interdependency between the Kerberos protocols and the Microsoft distributed computing environment
	(DCE) remote procedure calls (RPCs) that themselves are an integral part of the SMB/CIFS protocols as used by
	Microsoft.
	</p><p>
	Microsoft makes the following comment in a reference in a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/interop/mgmt/kerberos.asp" target="_top">
	technet</a> article:
	</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2561906"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2561918"></a>
	The DCE Security Services are also layered on the Kerberos protocol. DCE authentication services use RPC 
	representation of Kerberos protocol messages. In addition, DCE uses the authorization data field in Kerberos 
	tickets to convey Privilege Attribute Certificates (PACs) that define user identity and group membership. 
	The DCE PAC is used in a similar manner as Windows NT Security IDs for user authorization and access control. 
	Windows NT services will not be able to translate DCE PACs into Windows NT user and group identifiers. This 
	is not an issue with Kerberos interoperability, but rather an issue of interoperability between DCE and 
	Windows NT access control information.

	Share-definition-based access controls can be used like a check-point or like a pile-driver. Just as a
	check-point can be used to require someone who wants to get through to meet certain requirements, so
	it is possible to require the user (or group the user belongs to) to meet specified credential-related 
	objectives. It can be likened to a pile-driver by overriding default controls, in that having met the 
	credential-related objectives, the user can be granted powers and privileges that would not normally be 
	available under default settings.

	It must be emphasized that the controls here discussed can act as a filter, or give rights of passage,
	that act as a super-structure over normal directory and file access controls. However, share level
	ACLs act at a higher level than to share definition controls because the user must filter through the
	share level controls to get to the share definition controls. The proper hierarchy of controls implemented
	by Samba and Windows networking consists of:

	Consider the following extract from a <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file defining the share called <tt class="constant">Apps</tt>:
</p><pre class="screen">
[Apps]
	comment = Application Share
	path = /data/apps
	read only = Yes
	valid users = @Employees
</pre><p>
	This definition permits only those who are members of the group called <tt class="constant">Employees</tt> to 
	access the share.
	</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2562489"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2562500"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2562508"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2562516"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2562524"></a>
	On Domain Member servers and clients, even when the <i class="parameter"><tt>winbind use default domain</tt></i> has
	been specified, the use of Domain accounts in security controls requires fully qualified Domain specification,
	for example, <a class="indexterm" name="id2562542"></a>valid users = @"MEGANET\Northern Engineers". 
	Note the necessity to use the double quotes to avoid having the space in the Windows group name interpreted as a
	delimiter. 
	</p></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2562554"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2562562"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2562570"></a>
	If there is an ACL on the share itself to permit read/write access for all <tt class="constant">Employees</tt>
	as well as read/write for the group <tt class="constant">Doctors</tt>, both groups are permitted through
	to the share. However, at the moment an attempt is made to set up a connection to the share, a member of
	the group <tt class="constant">Doctors</tt>, who is not also a member of the group <tt class="constant">Employees</tt>,
	would immediately fail to validate.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2562601"></a>
	Consider another example. In this case, you want to permit all members of the group <tt class="constant">Employees</tt>
	to access the <tt class="constant">Apps</tt> share, except the user <tt class="constant">patrickj</tt>. This can be
	easily achieved by setting a share level ACL permitting only <tt class="constant">Employees</tt> to access the share,
	and then in the share definition controls excluding just <tt class="constant">patrickj</tt>. Here is how that might
	be done:
</p><pre class="screen">
[Apps]
        comment = Application Share
        path = /data/apps
        read only = Yes
        invalid users = patrickj
</pre><p>
	    <a class="indexterm" name="id2562642"></a>
	Let us assume that you want to permit the user <tt class="constant">gbshaw</tt>, to manage any file in the
	UNIX/Linux file system directory <tt class="filename">/data/apps</tt>, but you do not want to grant any write
	permissions beyond that directory tree. Here is one way this can be done:
</p><pre class="screen">
[Apps]
        comment = Application Share
        path = /data/apps
        read only = Yes
        invalid users = patrickj
        admin users = gbshaw
</pre><p>
	    <a class="indexterm" name="id2562673"></a>
	Now we have a set of controls that permits only <tt class="constant">Employees</tt> who are also members of
	the group <tt class="constant">Doctors</tt>, excluding the user <tt class="constant">patrickj</tt>, to have 
	read-only privilege, but the user <tt class="constant">gbshaw</tt> is granted administrative rights.
	The administrative rights conferred upon the user <tt class="constant">gbshaw</tt> permit operation as
	if that user has logged in as the user <tt class="constant">root</tt> on the UNIX/Linux system, and thus
	for access to the directory tree that has been shared (exported) permit the user to override controls
	that apply to all other users on that resource.
	</p><p>
	There are additional check-point controls that may be used. For example, if for the same share we now
	want to provide the user <tt class="constant">peters</tt> with the ability to write to one directory to
	which he has write privilege in the UNIX file system, you can specifically permit that with the
	following settings:
</p><pre class="screen">
[Apps]
        comment = Application Share
        path = /data/apps
        read only = Yes
        invalid users = patrickj
        admin users = gbshaw
        write list = peters
</pre><p>
	    <a class="indexterm" name="id2562733"></a>
	This is a particularly complex example at this point, but it begins to demonstrate the possibilities.
	You should refer to the on-line manual page for the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file for more information regarding
	the check-point controls that Samba implements.
	</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2562754"></a>Override Controls</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2562761"></a>
	Override controls implemented by Samba permit actions like the adoption of a different identity 
	during file system operations, the forced overwriting of normal file and directory permissions,
	and so on. You should refer to the on-line manual page for the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file for more information regarding
        the override controls that Samba implements.
	</p><p>
	In the following example, you want to create a Windows networking share that any user can access.
	However, you want all read and write operations to be performed as if the user <tt class="constant">billc</tt>
	and member of the group <tt class="constant">Mentors</tt> read/write the files. Here is one way this
	can be done:
</p><pre class="screen">
[someshare]
	comment = Some Files Everyone May Overwrite
	path = /data/somestuff
	read only = No
	force user = billc
	force group = Mentors
</pre><p>
	    <a class="indexterm" name="id2562805"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2562813"></a>
	That is all there is to it. Well, it is almost that simple. The downside of this method is that
	users are logged onto the Windows client as themselves, and then immediately before accessing the
	file, Samba makes system calls to change the effective user and group to the forced settings
	specified, completes the file transaction, and then reverts to the actually logged on identity.
	This imposes significant overhead on Samba. The alternative way that effectively the same result

	The use of the <i class="parameter"><tt>force user</tt></i>, or the <i class="parameter"><tt>force group</tt></i>, may
	also have a severe impact on system (and in particular Windows client) performance. If opportunistic
	locking is enabled on the share (the default), it causes an <tt class="constant">oplock break</tt> to be
	sent to the client, even if the client has not opened the file. On networks that have high traffic
	density, or on links that are routed to a remote network segment, <tt class="constant">oplock breaks</tt>
	can be lost. This results in possible retransmission of the request, or the client may time-out while
	waiting for the file system transaction (read or write) to complete. The result can be a profound
	apparent performance degradation as the client continually attempts to reconnect to overcome the
	effect of the lost <tt class="constant">oplock break</tt>, or time-out.

	Samba has been designed and implemented so that it respects as far as is feasible the security and
	user privilege controls that are built into the UNIX/Linux operating system. Samba does nothing
	with respect to file system access that violates file system permission settings, unless it is
	explicitly instructed to do otherwise through share definition controls. Given that Samba obeys
	UNIX file system controls, this chapter does not document simple information that can be obtained
	from a basic UNIX training guide. Instead, one common example of a typical problem is used
	to demonstrate the most effective solution referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2562981"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2562989"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2562997"></a>
	One of the common issues that repeatedly pops up on the Samba mailing lists involves the saving of
	Microsoft Office files (Word and Excel) to a network drive. Here is the typical sequence:
	</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
		A user opens a Work document from a network drive. The file was owned by user <tt class="constant">janetp</tt>
		and  [users], and was set read/write enabled for everyone.
		</p></li><li><p>
		File changes and edits are made.
		</p></li><li><p>
		The file is saved, and MS Word is closed.
		</p></li><li><p>
		The file is now owned by the user <tt class="constant">billc</tt> and group <tt class="constant">doctors</tt>,
		and is set read/write by <tt class="constant">billc</tt>, read only by <tt class="constant">doctors</tt>, and
		no access by everyone.
		</p></li><li><p>
		The original owner can not now access her own file and is &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>justifiably</em></span></span>&#8221; upset.
		</p></li></ol></div><p>
	There have been many postings over the years that report the same basic problem. Frequently Samba users
	want to know when this &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>bug</em></span></span>&#8221; will be fixed. The fact is, this is not a bug in Samba at all.
	Here is the real sequence of what happens in the case mentioned above.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2563091"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2563099"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2563107"></a>
	When the user saves a file, MS Word creates a new (temporary) file. This file is naturally owned
	by the user who creates the file (<tt class="constant">billc</tt>) and has the permissions that follow
	that user's default settings within the operating system (UNIX/Linux). When MS Word has finished writing
	the file to disk, it then renames the new (temporary) file to the name of the old one. MS Word does not
	change the ownership or permissions to what they were on the original file. The file is thus a totally
	new file, and the old one has been deleted in the process.
	</p><p>
	Samba received a request to create a new file, and then to rename the file to a new name. The old file that
	has the same name is now automatically deleted. Samba has no way of knowing that the new file should
	perhaps have the same ownership and permissions as the old file. To Samba, these are entirely independent
	operations.
	</p><p>
	The question is: &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>How can we solve the problem?</em></span></span>&#8221;
	</p><p>
	The solution is simple. Use UNIX file system permissions and controls to your advantage. Follow these
	simple steps to create a share in which all files will consistently be owned by the same user and the
	same group:
	</p><div class="procedure"><p class="title"><b>Procedure 10.2. Using Directory Permissions to Force File User and Group Ownership</b></p><ol type="1"><li><p>
		Change your share definition so that it matches this pattern:
</p><pre class="screen">
[finance]
        path = /usr/data/finance
        browseable = Yes
        read only = No
</pre><p>
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2563180"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2563192"></a>
		Set consistent user and group permissions recursively down the directory tree as shown here:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> chown -R janetp.users /usr/data/finance
</pre><p>
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2563224"></a>
		Set the files and directory permissions to be read/write for owner and group, and not accessible
		to others (everyone) using the following command:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> chmod ug+rwx,o-rwx /usr/data/finance
</pre><p>
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2563253"></a>
		Set the SGID (super-group) bit on all directories from the top down. This means all files 
		can be created with the permissions of the group set on the directory. It means all users 
		who are members of the group <tt class="constant">finance</tt> can read and write all files in 
		the directory. The directory is not readable or writable by anyone who is not in the 
		<tt class="constant">finance</tt> group. Simply follow this example:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> find /usr/data/finance -type d -exec chmod ug+s {}\;
</pre><p>

		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2563293"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2563301"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2563309"></a>
		Make sure all users that must have read/write access to the directory have 
		<tt class="constant">finance</tt> group membership as their primary group, 
		for example, the group they belong to in <tt class="filename">/etc/passwd</tt>.
		</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2563334"></a>Managing Windows 200x ACLs</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2563341"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2563349"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2563357"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2563365"></a>
	Samba must translate Windows 2000 ACLs to UNIX Posix ACLs. This has some interesting side effects because
	of the fact that there is not a 1:1 equivalence between them. The as-close-as-possible ACLs match means
	that some transactions are not possible from MS Windows clients. One of these is to reset the ownership
	of directories and files. If you want to reset ownership, this must be done from a UNIX/Linux login.
	</p><p>
	There are two possible ways to set ACLs on UNIX/Linux file systems from a Windows network workstation,
	either via File Manager or via the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Computer Management interface.

	Yet another alternative method for setting desired security settings on the shared resource files and
	directories can be achieved by logging into UNIX/Linux and setting Posix ACLs directly using command-line
	tools. Here is an example session on the same resource as in the immediately preceding example on a SUSE 9
	Linux system:
	</p><div class="procedure"><ol type="1"><li><p>
		Log into the Linux system as the user <tt class="constant">root</tt>.
		</p></li><li><p>
		Change directory to the location of the exported (shared) Windows file share (Apps), which is in
		the directory <tt class="filename">/data</tt>. Execute the following:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> cd /data
</pre><p>
		Retrieve the existing Posix ACLs entry by executing:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> getfacl apps
# file: apps
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rwx
group::rwx
other::r-x
</pre><p>
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2563946"></a>
		You want to add permission for <tt class="constant">AppsMgrs</tt> to enable them to
		manage the applications (apps) share. It is important to set the ACL recursively
		so that the AppsMgrs have this capability throughout the directory tree that is 
		being shared. This is done using the <tt class="constant">-R</tt> option as shown.
		Execute the following:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> setfacl -m -R group:AppsMgrs:rwx /data/apps
</pre><p>
		Because setting an ACL does not provide a response, you immediately validate the command executed
		as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> getfacl /data/apps
# file: apps
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rwx
group::rwx
group:AppsMgrs:rwx
mask::rwx
other::r-x
</pre><p>
		This confirms that the change of Posix ACL permissions has been effective.
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2564002"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2564009"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2564017"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2564025"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2564033"></a>
		It is highly recommend that you should read the on-line manual page for the <span><b class="command">setfacl</b></span>
		and <span><b class="command">getfacl</b></span> commands. This provides information regarding how to set/read the default
		ACLs and how that may be propagated through the directory tree. In Windows ACLs terms, this is the equivalent
		of setting <tt class="constant">inheritance</tt> properties.

		Sure. You do not have to set the SUID bit on the directory. Simply execute the following command
		to permit file ownership to be retained by the user who created it:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> find /usr/data/finance -type d -exec chmod g+s {}\;
</pre><p>
		Note that this required no more than removing the <tt class="constant">u</tt> argument so that the
		SUID bit is not set for the owner.

		In the book, &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>The Official Samba-3 HOWTO and Reference Guide</em></span></span>&#8221;, you recommended use

		Either tool can be used with equal effect. There is no benefit of one over the other, except that
		the MMC utility is present on all Windows 200x/XP systems and does not require additional software
		to be downloaded and installed. Note that if you want to manage user and group accounts in your
		Samba controlled Domain, the only tool that permits that is the NT4 Domain User Manager which
		is provided as part of the <tt class="filename">SRVTOOLS.EXE</tt> utility.
