	Ever since Microsoft announced that they are discontinuing support for Windows
	NT4, Samba users started to ask for detailed instructions for how to migrate
	from NT4 to Samba-3. This chapter provides background information that should
	meet these needs.
	</p><p>
	One wonders how many NT4 systems will be left in service by the time you read this
	book though.
	</p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2549168"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2549175"></a>
	Network administrators who want to migrate off a Windows NT4 environment know
	one thing with certainty. They feel that NT4 has been abandoned and they want
	to update. The desire to get off NT4 and to not adopt Windows 200x and Active
	Directory is driven by a mixture of concerns over complexity, cost, fear of
	failure, and much more.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2549192"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549200"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549211"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549222"></a>
	The migration from NT4 to Samba-3 can involve a number of factors, including:
	migration of data to another server, migration of network environment controls
	such as group policies, and finally migration of the users, groups, and machine
	accounts.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2549241"></a>
	It should be pointed out now that it is possible to migrate some systems from
	Windows NT4 Domain environments to a Samba-3 Domain Environment. This is certainly
	not possible in every case. It is possible to just migrate the Domain accounts
	to Samba-3 and then to switch machines, but as a hands-off transition, this is more
	an exception than the rule. Most systems require some tweaking and adjusting
	following migration before an environment that is acceptable for immediate use
	is obtained.
	</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2549263"></a>Assignment Tasks</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2549270"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549278"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549286"></a>
		You are about to migrate an MS Windows NT4 Domain accounts database to
		a Samba-3 server. The Samba-3 server is using a 
		<i class="parameter"><tt>passdb backend</tt></i> based on LDAP. The 
		<tt class="constant">ldapsam</tt> is ideal because an LDAP backend can be distributed
		for use with BDCs  generally essential for larger networks.
		</p><p>
		Your objective is to document the process of migrating user and group accounts
		from several NT4 Domains into a single Samba-3 LDAP backend database.
		</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2549322"></a>Dissection and Discussion</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2549328"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549336"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549344"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549358"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549373"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549381"></a>
	The migration process takes a snap-shot of information that is stored in the
	Windows NT4 registry based accounts database. That information resides in
	the Security Account Manager (SAM) portion of the NT4 Registry under keys called
	<tt class="constant">SAM</tt> and <tt class="constant">SECURITY</tt>.
	</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2549408"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549415"></a>
	The Windows NT4 registry keys called <tt class="constant">SAM</tt> and <tt class="constant">SECURITY</tt>
	are protected so that you cannot view the contents. If you change the security setting
	to reveal the contents under these hive keys, your Windows NT4 Domain is crippled. Do not
	do this unless you are willing to render your domain controller inoperative.
	</p></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2549439"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549450"></a>
	Before commencing an NT4 to Samba-3 migration, you should consider what your objectives are.
	While in some cases it is possible simply to migrate an NT4 domain to a single Samba-3 server,
	that may not be a good idea from an administration perspective. Since you are going through a
	certain amount of disruptive activity anyhow, why not take this as an opportunity to review
	the structure of the network, how Windows clients are controlled and how they
	interact with the network environment.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2549469"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549481"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549489"></a>
	MS Windows NT4 was introduced some time around 1996. Many environments in which NT4 was deployed
	have done little to keep the NT4 server environment up-to-date with more recent Windows releases, 
	particularly Windows XP Professional. The migration provides opportunity to revise and update 
	roaming profile deployment as well as folder redirection. Given that you must port the 
	greater network configuration of this from the old NT4 server to the new Samba-3 server, you
	also must validate the security descriptors in the profiles share as well as network logon
	scripts. Feedback from sites that are migrating to Samba-3 suggests that many are using this
	as a good time to update desktop systems also. In all, the extra effort should constitute no
	real disruption to users, rather with due diligence and care should make their network experience
	a much happier one.

		Migration of an NT4 Domain user and group database to Samba-3 involves a certain strategic
		element. Many sites have asked for instructions regarding merging of multiple different NT4
		Domains into one Samba-3 LDAP database. It would appear that this is viewed as a significant
		added value compared with the alternative of migration to Windows Server 200x and Active
		Directory. The diagram in <a href="migration.html#ch8-migration" title="Figure 8.1. Schematic Explaining the net rpc vampire Process">???</a> illustrates the effect of migration
		from a Windows NT4 Domain to a Samba Domain.
		</p><div class="figure"><a name="ch8-migration"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 8.1. Schematic Explaining the net rpc vampire Process</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/ch8-migration.png" width="297" alt="Schematic Explaining the net rpc vampire Process"></div></div><p>
		In any case, the migration process involves the following steps:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
			Prepare the target Samba-3 server. This involves configuring Samba-3 for
			migration to either a tdbsam or an ldapsam backend.
			</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2549606"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549613"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549621"></a>
			Clean up the source NT4 PDC. Delete all accounts that need not be migrated.
			Delete all files that should not be migrated. Where possible, change NT Group
			names so there are no spaces or uppercase characters. This is important if
			the target UNIX host insists on Posix compliant all lower-case user and group
			names.
			</p></li><li><p>
			Step through the migration process.
			</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2549644"></a>
			Remove the NT4 PDC from the network.
			</p></li><li><p>
			Upgrade the Samba-3 server from a BDC to a PDC, and validate all account
			information.
			</p></li></ul></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2549663"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549671"></a>
		If you are wanting to merge multiple NT4 Domain account databases into one Samba Domain,
		you must now dump the contents of the first migration and edit it as appropriate. Now clean
		out (remove) the tdbsam backend file (<tt class="filename">passdb.tdb</tt>), or the LDAP database
		files. You must start each migration with a new database into which you merge your NT4 
		domains.
		</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2549694"></a>
		At this point, you are ready to perform the second migration following the same steps as
		for the first. In other words, dump the database, edit it, and then you may merge the
		dump for the first and second migrations.
		</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2549709"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549717"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549724"></a>
		You must be careful. If you choose to migrate to an LDAP backend, your dump file
		now contains the full account information, including the Domain SID. The Domain SID for each 
		of the two NT4 Domains will be different. You must choose one, and change the Domain 
		portion of the account SIDs so that all are the same.
		</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2549741"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549749"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549757"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549765"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549772"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549780"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549788"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549796"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549804"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549812"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549820"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2549828"></a>
		If you choose to use a tdbsam (<tt class="filename">passdb.tdb</tt>) backend file, your best choice
		is to use <span><b class="command">pdbedit</b></span> to export the contents of the tdbsam file into an
		smbpasswd data file. This automatically strips out all Domain specific information,
		such as logon hours, logon machines, logon script, profile path, as well as the Domain SID.
		The resulting file can be easily merged with other migration attempts (each of which must start
		with a clean file). It should also be noted that all users that end up in the merged smbpasswd
		file must have an account in <tt class="filename">/etc/passwd</tt>. The resulting smbpasswd file
		may be exported/imported into either a tdbsam (<tt class="filename">passdb.tdb</tt>), or else into
		an LDAP backend.

		The merging of multiple Windows NT4 style Domains into a single LDAP-backend-based Samba-3
		Domain may be seen by those who had power over them as a loss of prestige or a loss of
		power. The imposition of a single Domain may even be seen as a threat. So in migrating and
		merging account databases, be consciously aware of the political fall-out in which you
		may find yourself entangled when key staff feel a loss of prestige.
		</p><p>
		The best advice that can be given to those who set out to merge NT4 Domains into one single
		Samba-3 Domain is to promote (sell) the action as one that reduces costs and delivers
		greater network interoperability and manageability.

	You can present here the steps and example output for two NT4 to Samba-3 Domain migrations. The
	first uses an LDAP-based backend, and the second uses a tdbsam backend. In each case the
	scripts you specify in the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file for the <i class="parameter"><tt>add user script</tt></i>
	collection of parameters are used to effect the addition of accounts into the passdb backend.
	</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2549968"></a>NT4 Migration Using LDAP Backend</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
	In this instance, you migrate an NT4 PDC to an LDAP backend. The accounts you are about
	to migrate are shown in <a href="migration.html#NT4DUM" title="Figure 8.2. View of Accounts in NT4 Domain User Manager">???</a>. In this example you make use of the
	smbldap-tools scripts to add the accounts that are migrated into the ldapsam passdb backend.
	Four scripts are essential to the migration process. There are other scripts that will be required
	for daily management, but these are not critical to migration. The critical scripts are dependant
	on which passdb backend is being used. Refer to <a href="migration.html#ch8-vampire" title="Table 8.1. Samba smb.conf Scripts Essential to Migration">???</a> to see which scripts
	must be provided so that the migration process can complete.
	</p><p>
	Do verify that you have correctly specified in the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file the scripts, and arguments 
	that should be passed to them, before attempting to perform the account migration.

	The UNIX/Linux <span><b class="command">usermod</b></span> utility does not permit simple user addition to (or deletion
	of users from) groups. This is a feature provided by the smbldap-tools scripts. If you want this
	capability you will need to create your own tool to do this. Alternately, you can search the web
	to locate a utility called <span><b class="command">groupmem</b></span> (by George Kraft) that provides this functionality.
	The <span><b class="command">groupmem</b></span> utility was contributed to the shadow package but has not surfaced
	in the formal commands provided by Linux distributions (March 2004).

		This is a recommendation that permits the data from each NT4 Domain to
		be kept separate until you are ready to merge them. Also, if you do not do this,
		you may find errors due to users or groups from multiple Domains having the
		same name, but different SIDs. It is better to permit each migration to complete
		without undue errors and then to handle the merging of vampired data under
		proper supervision.

		Yes, so long as the SID you create has the same structure as an auto-generated SID.
		The typical SID looks like this: S-1-5-21-XXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXX, where
		the XXXXXXXXXX can be any number with from 6 to 10 digits. On the other hand, why
		would you really want to create your own SID? I cannot think of a good reason.
		You may want to set the SID to one that is already in use somewhere on your network,
		but that is a little different from straight out creating your own Domain SID.

		Samba-3 must be able to tie all user and group account SIDs to a UNIX UID or GID. Samba
		does not fabricate the UNIX IDs from thin air, but rather requires them to be located
		in a suitable place. 
		</p><p>
		When migrating a <tt class="filename">smbpasswd</tt> file to an LDAP backend, the
		UID of each account is taken together with the account information in the 
		<tt class="filename">/etc/passwd</tt> and both sets of data are used to create the account
		entrt in the LDAP database. 
		</p><p>
		If you elect to create the Posix account also, the entire UNIX account is copied to the 
		LDAP backend. The same occurs with NT groups and UNIX groups. At the conclusion of 
		migration to the LDAP database, the accounts may be removed from the UNIX database files. 
		In short then, all UNIX and Windows networking accounts, both in tdbsam as well as in 
		LDAP, require UIDs/GIDs.

		If you have 10 tdbsam Samba Domains, there is considerable risk that there are a number of
		accounts that have the same UNIX identifier (UID/GID). This means that you almost 
		certainly have to edit a lot of data. It would be easiest to dump each database in smbpasswd
		file format and then manually edit all records to ensure that each has a unique UID. Each
		file can then be imported a number of ways. You can use the <span><b class="command">pdbedit</b></span> tool,
		to affect a transfer from the smbpasswd file to LDAP, or you can migrate them en masse to
		tdbsam and then to LDAP. The final choice is yours. Just remember to verify all accounts that
		you have migrated before handing over access to a user. After all, too many users with a bad
		migration experience may threaten your career.

		I would recommend not. The machine accounts should still work, but there are registry entries

		Samba-3 currently does not implement multiple group membership internally. If you use the Windows 
		NT4 Domain User Manager to manage accounts and you have an LDAP backend, the multiple group
		membership is stored in the Posix groups area. If you use either tdbsam or smbpasswd backend,
		then multiple group membership is handled through the UNIX groups file. When you dump the user
		accounts no group account information is provided. When you edit (change) UIDs and GIDs in each
		file to which you migrated the NT4 Domain data, do not forget to edit the UNIX <tt class="filename">/etc/passwd</tt>
		and <tt class="filename">/etc/group</tt> information also. That is where the multiple group information
		is most closely at your fingertips.

		A Windows 200x group name can be up to 254 characters long, while in Windows NT4 the group
		name is limited to 20 characters. Most UNIX systems limit this to 32 characters. Windows 
		groups can contain upper- and lower-case characters, as well as spaces.
		Many UNIX system do not permit the use of upper-case characters, and some do not permit the
		space character either. A number of systems (i.e., Linux) work fine with both upper-case
		and space characters in group names, but the shadow-utils package that provides the group
		control functions (<span><b class="command">groupadd, groupmod, groupdel</b></span>, and so on) do not permit them.
		Also, a number of UNIX systems management tools enforce their own particular interpretation
		of the Posix standards, and likewise do not permit upper-case or space characters in group
		or user account names. You have to experiment with your system to find what its 
		peculiarities are.

		My Windows NT4 PDC has 323,000 user accounts. How long will it take to migrate them to a Samba-3

		</p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"><b></b></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
		UNIX UIDs and GIDs on most UNIX systems use an unsigned short or an unsigned integer. Recent Linux
		kernels support at least a much larger number. On systems that have a 16-bit constraint on UID/GIDs,
		you would not be able to migrate 323,000 accounts because this number can not fit into a 16-bit unsigned
		integer. UNIX/Linux systems that have a 32-bit UID/GID can easily handle this number of accounts. 
		Please check this carefully before you attempt to effect a migration using the vampire process.

		Migration speed depends much on the processor speed, the network speed, disk I/O capability, and
		LDAP update overheads. On a dual processor AMD MP1600+ with 1 GB memory, that was mirroring LDAP
		to a second identical system over 1 gigabit ethernet, I was able to migrate around 180 user accounts
		per minute. Migration would obviously go much faster if LDAP mirroring is turned off during the migration.
