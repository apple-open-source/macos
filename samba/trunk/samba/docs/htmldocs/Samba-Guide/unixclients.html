	The most frequently discussed Samba subjects over the past two years have focused around Domain Control and printing. 
	It is well known that Samba is a file and print server. A recent survey conducted by Open Magazine found 
	that of all respondents: 97% use Samba for file and print services, and 68% use Samba for Domain Control. See the 
	<a href="http://www.open-mag.com/cgi-bin/opencgi/surveys/survey.cgi?survey_name=samba" target="_top">Open-Mag</a>
	Web site for current information. The survey results as found on January 14, 2004, as shown in

	While Domain Control is an exciting subject, basic file and print sharing remains the staple bread-and-butter
	function that Samba provides. Yet this book may give the appearance of having focused too much on more
	exciting aspects of Samba deployment. This chapter directs your attention to provide important information on
	the addition of Samba servers into your present Windows network  whatever the controlling technology
	may be. So let's get back to Abmas and our good friends Bob Jordan and company.

	Bob Jordan looks back over the achievements of the past year or two. Daily events are rather straightforward
	with not too many distractions or problems. Bob, your team is doing well, but a number of employees
	are asking for Linux desktop systems. Your network has grown and demands additional Domain Member servers. Let's
	get on with this; Christine and Stan are ready to go.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2552030"></a>
	Stan Soroka is firmly in control of the Department of the Future, while Christine is enjoying a stable and
	predictable network environment. It is time to add more servers and to add Linux desktops. It is
	time to meet the demands of future growth and endure trial by fire. Go on, walk the steps
	with Stan and Company.

	You must now add UNIX/Linux Domain Member servers to your network. You have a friend who has a Windows 2003
	Active Directory Domain network who wants to add a Samba/Linux server and has asked Christine to help him
	out. Your real objective is to help Christine to see more of the way the Microsoft world lives and use
	her help to get validation that Samba really does live up to expectations.
	</p><p>
	Over the past six months, you have hired several new staff who want Linux on their desktops. You must integrate
	these systems to make sure that Abmas is not building islands of technology. You ask Christine to
	do likewise at Swodniw Biz NL (your friend's company) to help them to evaluate a Linux desktop. You want to make
	the right decision, don't you?

	Recent Samba mailing list activity is witness to how many sites are using winbind. Some have no trouble
	at all with it, yet to others the problems seem insurmountable. Periodically there are complaints concerning
	an inability to achieve identical user and group IDs between Windows and UNIX environments.

	You provide step-by-step implementations of the various tools that can be used for identity
	resolution. You also provide working examples of solutions for integrated authentication for
	both UNIX/Linux and Windows environments.

		One of the great challenges we face when people ask us, &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="emphasis"><em>What is the best way to solve
		this problem?</em></span></span>&#8221; is to get beyond the facts so we can not only clearly comprehend
		the immediate technical problem, but also understand how needs may change.
		</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2552138"></a>
		There are a few facts we should note when dealing with the question of how best to
		integrate UNIX/Linux clients and servers into a Windows networking environment:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2552155"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552163"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552171"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552182"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552190"></a>
			A Domain Controller (PDC or BDC) is always authoritative for all accounts in its Domain.
			This means that a BDC must (of necessity) be able to resolve all account UIDs and GIDs
			to the same values that the PDC resolved them to.
			</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2552206"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552214"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552229"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552237"></a>
			A Domain Member can be authoritative for local accounts, but is never authoritative for
			Domain accounts. If a user is accessing a Domain Member server and that user's account
			is not known locally, the Domain Member server must resolve the identity of that user
			from the Domain in which that user's account resides. It must then map that ID to a
			UID/GID pair that it can use locally. This is handled by <span><b class="command">winbindd</b></span>.
			</p></li><li><p>
			Samba, when running on a Domain Member server, can resolve user identities from a
			number of sources:

			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2552270"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552277"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552285"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552293"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552301"></a>
				By executing a system <span><b class="command">getpwnam()</b></span> or <span><b class="command">getgrnam()</b></span> call. 
				On systems that support it, this utilizes the name service switch (NSS) facility to 
				resolve names according to the configuration of the <tt class="filename">/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt> 
				file. NSS can be configured to use LDAP, winbind, NIS, or local files.
				</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2552335"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552343"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552351"></a>
				Performing, via NSS, a direct LDAP search (where an LDAP passdb backend has been configured).
				This requires the use of the PADL nss_ldap tool (or equivalent).
				</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2552366"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552374"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552381"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552389"></a>
				Directly by querying <span><b class="command">winbindd</b></span>. The <span><b class="command">winbindd</b></span>
				contact a Domain Controller to attempt to resolve the identity of the user or group. It
				receives the Windows networking security identifier (SID) for that appropriate
				account and then allocates a local UID or GID from the range of available IDs and
				creates an entry in its <tt class="filename">winbindd_idmap.tdb</tt> and 
				<tt class="filename">winbindd_cache.tdb</tt> files.
				</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2552431"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552439"></a>
				If the parameter 
			<a class="indexterm" name="id2552448"></a>idmap backend = ldap:ldap://myserver.domain
				was specified and the LDAP server has been configured with a container in which it may
				store the IDMAP entries, all Domain Members may share a common mapping.
				</p></li></ul></div><p>
			</p><p>
			Irrespective of how <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> is configured, winbind creates and caches a local copy of
			the ID mapping database. It uses the <tt class="filename">winbindd_idmap.tdb</tt>, and
                                <tt class="filename">winbindd_cache.tdb</tt> files to do this.
			</p><p>
			Which of the above resolver methods is chosen is determined by the way that Samba is configured 
			in the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file. Some of the configuration options are rather less than obvious to the 
			casual user.
			</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2552501"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552509"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552521"></a>
			If you wish to make use of accounts (users and/or groups) that are local to (i.e., capable
			of being resolved using) the name service switch (NSS) facility, it is imperative to use the 
			<a class="indexterm" name="id2552533"></a>winbind enable local accounts = Yes
			in the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file. This parameter specifically applies only to Domain Controllers, 
			not to Domain Member servers.
			</p></li></ul></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2552552"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552560"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552568"></a>
		For many administrators, it should be plain that the use of an LDAP-based repository for all network
		accounts (both for Posix accounts as well as for Samba accounts) provides the most elegant and
		controllable facility. You eventually appreciate the decision to use LDAP.
		</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2552584"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552592"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552600"></a>
		If your network account information resides in an LDAP repository, you should use it ahead of any
		alternative method. This means that if it is humanly possible to use the <span><b class="command">nss_ldap</b></span>
		tools to resolve UNIX account UIDs/GIDs via LDAP, this is the preferred solution, as it provides
		a more readily controllable method for asserting the exact same user and group identifiers 
		throughout the network.
		</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2552624"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552635"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552643"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552651"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552659"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552667"></a>
		In the situation where UNIX accounts are held on the Domain Member server itself, the only effective
		way to use them involves the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> entry 
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2552684"></a>winbind trusted domains only = Yes. This forces 
		Samba (<span><b class="command">smbd</b></span>) to perform a <span><b class="command">getpwnam()</b></span> system call that can
		then be controlled via <tt class="filename">/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt> file settings. The use of this parameter
		disables the use of Samba with Trusted Domains (i.e., External Domains).
		</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2552716"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552724"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552735"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552743"></a>
	        Winbind can be used to create an appliance mode Domain Member server. In this capacity, <span><b class="command">winbindd</b></span>
		is configured to automatically allocate UIDs/GIDs from numeric ranges set in the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file. The allocation
		is made for all accounts that connect to that Domain Member server, whether within its own Domain or from
		Trusted Domains. If not stored in an LDAP backend, each Domain Member maintains its own unique mapping database.
		This means that it is almost certain that a given user who accesses two Domain Member servers does not have the
		same UID/GID on both servers  however, this is transparent to the Windows network user. This data
		is stored in the <tt class="filename">winbindd_idmap.tdb</tt> and <tt class="filename">winbindd_cache.tdb</tt> files.
		</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2552792"></a>
		The use of an LDAP backend for the Winbind IDMAP facility permits Windows Domain security identifiers (SIDs)
		mappings to UIDs/GIDs to be stored centrally. The result is a consistent mapping across all Domain Member
		servers so configured. This solves one of the major headaches for network administrators who need to copy
		files between/across network file servers.

		One of the most fierce conflicts recently being waged is one of resistance to the adoption of LDAP, in
		particular OpenLDAP, as a replacement for UNIX NIS (previously called Yellow Pages). Let's face it, LDAP
		is different and requires a new approach to the need for a better identity management solution. The more
		you work with LDAP, the more its power and flexibility emerges from its dark, cavernous chasm.
		</p><p>
		LDAP is a most suitable solution for heterogenous environments. If you need crypto, add Kerberos. 
		The reason these are preferable is because they are heterogenous. Windows solutions of this sort are NOT 
		heterogenous by design. This is fundamental  it isn't religious or political. This also doesn't say that 
		you can't use Windows Active Directory in a heterogenous environment  it can be done, it just requires 
		commercial integration products  it's just not what Active Directory was designed for.
		</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2552890"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2552897"></a>
		A number of long-term UNIX devotees have recently commented in various communications that the Samba Team
		is the first application group to almost force network administrators to use LDAP. It should be pointed
		out that we resisted this as long as we could. It is not out of laziness or out of malice that LDAP has
		finally emerged as the preferred identity management backend for Samba. We recommend LDAP for your total
		organizational directory needs.

	The Domain Member server and the Domain Member client are at the center of focus in this chapter.
	Configuration of Samba-3 Domain Controller has been covered in earlier chapters, so if your 
	interest is in Domain Controller configuration, you will not find that here. You will find good
	oil that helps you to add Domain Member servers and clients.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2552964"></a>
	In practice, Domain Member servers and Domain Member workstations are very different entities, but in
	terms of technology they share similar core infrastructure. A technologist would argue that servers
	and workstations are identical. Many users would argue otherwise, given that in a well-disciplined
	environment a workstation (client) is a device from which a user creates documents and files that
	are located on servers. A workstation is frequently viewed as a disposable (easy to replace) item,
	but a server is viewed as a core component of the business.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2552989"></a>
	One can look at this another way. If a workstation breaks down, one user is affected, but if a
	server breaks down, hundreds of users may not be able to work. The services that a workstation
	must provide are document and file production oriented; a server provides information storage
	and is distribution oriented.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2553005"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2553013"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2553021"></a>
	<span class="emphasis"><em>Why is this important?</em></span>  For starters, we must identify what
	components of the operating system and its environment must be configured. Also, it is necessary
	to recognize where the interdependencies between the various services to be used are.
	In particular, it is important to understand the operation of each critical part of the
	authentication process, the logon process, and how user identities get resolved and applied
	within the operating system and applications (like Samba) that depend on this and may
	actually contribute to it.
	</p><p>
	So, while here we demonstrate how to implement the technology. It is done within a context of
	what type of service need must be fulfilled.
	</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="sdcsdmldap"></a>Samba Domain with Samba Domain Member Server  Using LDAP</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2553067"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2553074"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2553082"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2553090"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2553101"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2553109"></a>
	In this example, it is assumed that you have Samba PDC/BDC servers. This means you are using
	an LDAP ldapsam backend. In this example, we are adding to the LDAP backend database (directory)
	containers for use by the IDMAP facility. This makes it possible to have globally consistent
	mapping of SIDs to/from UIDs/GIDs. This means that you are running <span><b class="command">winbindd</b></span>
	as part of your configuration. The primary purpose of running <span><b class="command">winbindd</b></span> (within
	this operational context) is to permit mapping of foreign SIDs (those not originating from our 
	own Domain). Foreign SIDs can come from any external Domain or from Windows clients that do not 
	belong to a Domain.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2553143"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2553150"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2553158"></a>
	If your installation is accessed only from clients that are members of your own domain, then
	it is not necessary to run <span><b class="command">winbindd</b></span> as long as all users can be resolved
	locally via the <span><b class="command">getpwnam()</b></span> system call. On NSS-enabled systems, this condition
	is met by having:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2553188"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2553196"></a>

		Resolution via NSS. On NSS-enabled systems, there is usually a facility to resolve IDs
		via multiple methods. The methods typically include: <span><b class="command">files, compat, db, ldap, 
		nis, nisplus, hesoid.</b></span>  When correctly installed, Samba adds to this list
		the <span><b class="command">winbindd</b></span> facility. The ldap facility is frequently the nss_ldap
		tool provided by PADL Software.
		</p></li></ul></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2553321"></a>
	The diagram in <a href="unixclients.html#ch9-sambadc" title="Figure 9.2. Samba Domain: Samba Member Server">???</a> demonstrates the relationship of samba and system 
	components that are involved in the Identity resolution process where Samba is used as a Domain
	Member server within a Samba Domain Control network.
	</p><div class="figure"><a name="ch9-sambadc"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9.2. Samba Domain: Samba Member Server</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/chap9-SambaDC.png" width="324" alt="Samba Domain: Samba Member Server"></div></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2553386"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2553394"></a>
	In this example configuration, Samba will directly search the LDAP-based passwd backend ldapsam
	to obtain authentication and user identity information. The IDMAP information is stored in the LDAP
	backend so that it can be shared by all Domain Member servers so that every user will have a
	consistent UID and GID across all of them. The IDMAP facility will be used for all foreign
	(i.e., not having the same SID as the Domain it is a member of) Domains. The configuration of 
	NSS will ensure that all unix processes will obtain a consistent UID/GID.
	</p><p>
	The instructions given here apply to the Samba environment as shown in Chapters 6 and 7.
	If your network does not have an LDAP slave server (i.e., Chapter 6 configuration), you
	must change the target LDAP server from <tt class="constant">lapdc</tt> to <tt class="constant">massive.</tt>

		You should notice the location of the users' home directories. First, make certain that
		the home directories exist on the Domain Member server; otherwise, the home directory
		share is not available. The home directories could be mounted off a domain controller
		using NFS, or by any other suitable means. Second, the absence of the Domain name in the
		home directory path is indicative that Identity resolution is not being done via Winbind.

		This shows that all is working as it should. Notice that in the LDAP database
		the users primary and secondary group memberships are identical. It is not
		necessary to add secondary group memberships (in the group database) if the
		user is already a member via primary group membership in the password database.
		When using winbind, it is in fact undesirable to do this as it results in
		doubling up of group memberships and may break winbind under certain conditions.
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2553648"></a>
		The LDAP directory must have a container object for IDMAP data. There are several ways you can
		check that your LDAP database is able to receive IDMAP information. One of the simplest is to
		execute:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> slapcat | grep -i idmap
dn: ou=Idmap,dc=abmas,dc=biz
ou: idmap
</pre><p>
	      <a class="indexterm" name="id2553673"></a>
	        If the execution of this command does not return IDMAP entries, you need to create an LDIF
		template file (see <a href="unixclients.html#ch9-ldifadd" title="Example 9.2. LDIF IDMAP Add-On Load File  File: /etc/openldap/idmap.LDIF">???</a>). You can add the required entries using the following command:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> ldapadd -x -D "cn=Manager,dc=abmas,dc=biz" \
		-w not24get &lt; /etc/openldap/idmap.LDIF
</pre><p>
		Samba automatically populates this LDAP directory container when it needs to.
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2553712"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2553726"></a>
		The system is ready to join the Domain. Execute the following:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> net rpc join -U root%not24et
Joined domain MEGANET2.
</pre><p>
		This indicates that the Domain join succeeded.
		</p></li><li><p>
		<a class="indexterm" name="id2553756"></a>
		Just joining the Domain is not quite enough, you must now provide a privilidged set
		of credentials through which <span><b class="command">winbindd</b></span> can interact with the ADS
		Domain servers. Execute the following to implant the necessary credentials:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> wbinfo --set-auth-user=Administrator%not24get
</pre><p>
-		The configuration is now ready to obtain ADS Domain user and group information.
		</p></li><li><p>
		You may now start Samba in the usual manner and your Samba Domain Member server
		is ready for use. Just add shares as required.

	You need to use this method for creating a Samba Domain Member server if any of the following conditions
	prevail:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
		LDAP support (client) is not installed on the system.
		</p></li><li><p>
		There are mitigating circumstances forcing a decision not to use LDAP.
		</p></li><li><p>
		The Samba Domain Member server must be part of a Windows NT4 Domain.
		</p></li></ul></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2554558"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2554566"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2554574"></a>
	Later in the chapter, you can see how to configure a Samba Domain Member server for a Windows ADS Domain.
	Right now your objective is to configure a Samba server that can be a member of a Windows NT4 style
	Domain and/or does not use LDAP.
	</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2554591"></a>
	If you use <span><b class="command">winbind</b></span> for Identity resolution, do make sure that there are no
	duplicate accounts.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2554609"></a>
	For example, do not have more than one account that has UID=0 in the password database. If there 
	is an account called <tt class="constant">root</tt> in the <tt class="filename">/etc/passwd</tt> database, 
	it is okay to have an account called <tt class="constant">root</tt> in the LDAP ldapsam or in the 
	tdbsam. But if there are two accounts in the passdb backend that have the same UID, winbind will 
	break. This means that the <tt class="constant">Administrator</tt> account must be called 
	<tt class="constant">root</tt>.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2554647"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2554655"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2554663"></a>
	Winbind will break if there is an account in <tt class="filename">/etc/passwd</tt> that has 
	the same UID as an account that is in LDAP ldapsam (or in tdbsam) but that differs in name only.
	</p></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2554682"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2554690"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2554698"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2554706"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2554717"></a>
	The following configuration uses CIFS/SMB protocols alone to obtain user and group credentials.
	The winbind information is locally cached in the <tt class="filename">winbindd_cache.tdb winbindd_idmap.tdb</tt>
	files. This provides considerable performance benefits compared with the LDAP solution, particularly
	where the LDAP lookups must traverse wide-area network links. You may examine the contents of these
	files using the tool <span><b class="command">tdbdump</b></span>, though you may have to build this from the Samba
	source code if it has not been supplied as part of a binary package distribution that you may be using.

	One of the much-sought-after features new to Samba-3 is the ability to join an Active Directory
	Domain using Kerberos protocols. This makes it possible to operate an entire Windows network
	without the need to run NetBIOS over TCP/IP and permits more secure networking in general. An
	exhaustively complete discussion of the protocols is not possible in this book; perhaps a
	later book may explore the intricacies of the NetBIOS-less operation that Samba-3 can participate
	in. For now, we simply focus on how a Samba-3 server can be made a Domain Member server.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2555656"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2555664"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2555671"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2555679"></a>
	The diagram in <a href="unixclients.html#ch9-adsdc" title="Figure 9.3. Active Directory Domain: Samba Member Server">???</a> demonstrates how Samba-3 interfaces with
	Microsoft Active Directory components. It should be noted that if Microsoft Windows Services
	for UNIX has been installed and correctly configured, it is possible to use client LDAP
	for Identity resolution just as can be done with Samba-3 when using an LDAP passdb backend.
	The UNIX tool that you need for this, as in the case of LDAP on UNIX/Linux, is the PADL
	Software nss_ldap tool-set. Compared with use of winbind and Kerberos, the use of 
	LDAP-based Identity resolution is a little less secure. In view of the fact that this solution
	requires additional software to be installed on the Windows 200x ADS Domain Controllers,
	and that means more management overhead, it is likely that most Samba-3 ADS client sites
	may elect to use winbind.
	</p><p>
	Do not attempt to use this procedure if you are not 100 percent certain that the build of Samba-3
	you are using has been compiled and linked with all the tools necessary for this to work.
	Given the importance of this step, you must first validate that the Samba-3 message block
	daemon (<span><b class="command">smbd</b></span>) has the necessary features.
	</p><p>
	The hypothetical domain you are using in this example assumes that the Abmas London office
	decided to take their own lead (some would say this is a typical behavior in a global
	corporate world; besides, a little divergence and conflict makes for an interesting life).
	The Windows Server 2003 ADS Domain is called <tt class="constant">london.abmas.biz</tt> and the
	name of the server is <tt class="constant">W2K3S</tt>. In ADS realm terms, the Domain Controller
	is known as <tt class="constant">w2k3s.london.abmas.biz</tt>. In NetBIOS nomenclature, the
	Domain Name is <tt class="constant">LONDON</tt> and the server name is <tt class="constant">W2K3S</tt>.
	</p><div class="figure"><a name="ch9-adsdc"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 9.3. Active Directory Domain: Samba Member Server</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/chap9-ADSDC.png" width="324" alt="Active Directory Domain: Samba Member Server"></div></div><div class="procedure"><ol type="1"><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2555804"></a>
		Before you try to use Samba-3, you want to know for certain that your executables have
		support for Kerberos and for LDAP. Execute the following to identify whether or
		not this build is perhaps suitable for use:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> cd /usr/sbin
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> smbd -b | grep KRB
   HAVE_KRB5_H
   HAVE_ADDR_TYPE_IN_KRB5_ADDRESS
   HAVE_KRB5
   HAVE_KRB5_AUTH_CON_SETKEY
   HAVE_KRB5_GET_DEFAULT_IN_TKT_ETYPES
   HAVE_KRB5_GET_PW_SALT
   HAVE_KRB5_KEYBLOCK_KEYVALUE
   HAVE_KRB5_KEYTAB_ENTRY_KEYBLOCK
   HAVE_KRB5_MK_REQ_EXTENDED

   HAVE_KRB5_STRING_TO_KEY
   HAVE_KRB5_STRING_TO_KEY_SALT
   HAVE_LIBKRB5
</pre><p>
		The above output was obtained on a SuSE Linux system and shows the output for
		Samba that has been compiled and linked with the Heimdal Kerberos libraries.
		The following is a typical output that will be found on a Red Hat Linux system that
		has been linked with the MIT Kerberos libraries:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> cd /usr/sbin
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> smbd -b | grep KRB

   HAVE_KRB5_USE_ENCTYPE

</pre><p>
		You can validate that Samba has been compiled and linked with LDAP support
		by executing:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> smbd -b | grep LDAP
massive:/usr/sbin # smbd -b | grep LDAP

   HAVE_LDAP_INITIALIZE
   HAVE_LDAP_SET_REBIND_PROC
   HAVE_LIBLDAP
   LDAP_SET_REBIND_PROC_ARGS
</pre><p>
		This does look promising; <span><b class="command">smbd</b></span> has been built with Kerberos and LDAP
		support. You are relieved to know that it is safe to progress.
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2555904"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2555915"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2555923"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2555931"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2555942"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2555954"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2555962"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2555970"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2555978"></a>
		The next step is to identify which version of the Kerberos libraries have been used.
		In order to permit Samba-3 to interoperate with Windows 2003 Active Directory, it is
		essential that it has been linked with either MIT Kerberos version 1.3.1 or later,
		or that it has been linked with Heimdal Kerberos 0.6 plus specific patches. You may
		identify what version of the MIT Kerberos libraries are installed on your system by
		executing (on Red Hat Linux):
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> rpm -q krb5
</pre><p>
		Or on SUSE Linux, execute:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> rpm -q heimdal
</pre><p>
		Please note that the RPMs provided by the Samba-Team are known to be working and have
		been validated. Red Hat Linux RPMs may be obtained from the Samba FTP sites. SUSE
		Linux RPMs may be obtained from <a href="ftp://ftp.sernet.de" target="_top">Sernet</a> in
		Germany.
		</p><p>
		From this point on, you are certain that the Samba-3 build you are using has the
		necessary capabilities. You can now configure Samba-3 and the name service 
		switcher (NSS). 
		</p></li><li><p>
		Using you favorite editor, configure the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file that is located in the 
		<tt class="filename">/etc/samba</tt> directory so that it has the contents shown 
		in <a href="unixclients.html#ch9-adssdm" title="Example 9.7. Samba Domain Member smb.conf File for Active Directory Membership">???</a>.
		</p></li><li><p>
		Edit or create the NSS control file so it has the contents shown in <a href="unixclients.html#ch9-nsswbnd" title="Example 9.6. Name Service Switch Control File: /etc/nsswitch.conf">???</a>.
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2556081"></a>
		Delete the file <tt class="filename">/etc/samba/secrets.tdb</tt>, if it exists. Of course, you
		do keep a backup, don't you?
		</p></li><li><p>
		Delete the tdb files that cache Samba information. You keep a backup of the old
		files, of course. You also remove all files to ensure that nothing can pollute your
		nice, new configuration. Execute the following (example is for SUSE Linux):
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> rm /var/lib/samba/*tdb
</pre><p>
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2556126"></a>
		Validate your <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file using <span><b class="command">testparm</b></span> (as you have
		done previously). Correct all errors reported before proceeding. The command you
		execute is:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> testparm -s | less
</pre><p>
		Now that you are satisfied that your Samba server is ready to join the Windows
		ADS Domain, let's move on.
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2556168"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2556182"></a>
		This is a good time to double-check everything and then execute the following
		command when everything you have done has checked out okay:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> net ads join -UAdministrator%not24get
Using short domain name -- LONDON
Joined 'FRAN' to realm 'LONDON.ABMAS.BIZ'
</pre><p>
		You have successfully made your Samba-3 server a member of the ADS Domain
		using Kerberos protocols.
		</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2556211"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2556219"></a>
		In the event that you receive no output messages, a silent return means that the
		Domain join failed. You should use <span><b class="command">ethereal</b></span> to identify what
		may be failing. Common causes of a failed join include:

		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2556242"></a>
			Defective or misconfigured DNS name resolution.
			</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2556258"></a>
			Restrictive security settings on the Windows 200x ADS Domain controller
			preventing needed communications protocols. You can check this by searching
			the Windows Server 200x Event Viewer.
			</p></li><li><p>
			Incorrectly configured <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file settings.
			</p></li><li><p>
			Lack of support of necessary Kerberos protocols because the version of MIT
			Kerberos (or Heimdal) in use is not up to date enough to support the necessary
			functionality.
			</p></li></ul></div><p>
	      <a class="indexterm" name="id2556292"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2556306"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2556314"></a>
		In any case, never execute the <span><b class="command">net rpc join</b></span> command in an attempt
		to join the Samba server to the Domain, unless you wish not to use the Kerberos
		security protocols. Use of the older RPC-based Domain join facility requires that
		Windows Server 200x ADS has been configured appropriately for mixed mode operation.
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2556340"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2556348"></a>
		If the <span><b class="command">tdbdump</b></span> is installed on your system (not essential),
		you can look inside the <tt class="filename">/etc/samba/secrets.tdb</tt> file. If
		you wish to do this, execute:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> tdbdump secrets.tdb
{
key = "SECRETS/SID/LONDON"

}
</pre><p>
		This is given to demonstrate to the skeptics that this process truly does work.
		</p></li><li><p>
		It is now time to start Samba in the usual way (as has been done many time before
		in this book).	
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2556406"></a>
		This is a good time to verify that everything is working. First, check that
		winbind is able to obtain the list of users and groups from the ADS Domain Controller.
		Execute the following:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> wbinfo -u
LONDON+Administrator
LONDON+Guest
LONDON+SUPPORT_388945a0
LONDON+krbtgt
LONDON+jht
</pre><p>
		Good, the list of users was obtained. Now do likewise for group accounts:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> wbinfo -g
LONDON+Domain Computers
LONDON+Domain Controllers
LONDON+Schema Admins
LONDON+Enterprise Admins
LONDON+Domain Admins
LONDON+Domain Users
LONDON+Domain Guests
LONDON+Group Policy Creator Owners
LONDON+DnsUpdateProxy
</pre><p>
		Excellent. That worked also, as expected.
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2556454"></a>
		Now repeat this via NSS to validate that full Identity resolution is
		functional as required. Execute:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> getent passwd
...
LONDON+Administrator:x:10000:10000:Administrator:
             /home/LONDON/administrator:/bin/bash
LONDON+Guest:x:10001:10001:Guest:
             /home/LONDON/guest:/bin/bash
LONDON+SUPPORT_388945a0:x:10002:10000:SUPPORT_388945a0:
             /home/LONDON/support_388945a0:/bin/bash
LONDON+krbtgt:x:10003:10000:krbtgt:
             /home/LONDON/krbtgt:/bin/bash
LONDON+jht:x:10004:10000:John H. Terpstra:
             /home/LONDON/jht:/bin/bash
</pre><p>
		Okay, ADS user accounts are being resolved. Now you try group resolution as follows:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> getent group
...
LONDON+Domain Computers:x:10002:
LONDON+Domain Controllers:x:10003:

</pre><p>
		This is very pleasing. Everything works as expected.
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2556511"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2556525"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2556536"></a>
		You may now perform final verification that communications between Samba-3 winbind and
		the Active Directory server is using Kerberos protocols. Execute the following:
</p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">root# </tt> net ads info
LDAP server: 192.168.2.123
LDAP server name: w2k3s
Realm: LONDON.ABMAS.BIZ

LDAP port: 389
Server time: Sat, 03 Jan 2004 02:44:44 GMT
KDC server: 192.168.2.123
Server time offset: 2
</pre><p>
		It should be noted that Kerberos protocols are time-clock critical. You should
		keep all server time clocks synchronized using the network time protocol (NTP).
		In any case, the output we obtained confirms that all systems are operational.
		</p></li><li><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2556574"></a>
		There is one more action you elect to take, just because you are paranoid and disbelieving,

	So far this chapter has been mainly concerned with the provision of file and print
	services for Domain Member servers. However, an increasing number of UNIX/Linux
	workstations are being installed that do not act as file or print servers to anyone
	other than a single desktop user. The key demand for desktop systems is to be able
	to log onto any UNIX/Linux or Windows desktop using the same network user credentials.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2557336"></a>
	The ability to use a common set of user credential across a variety of network systems
	is generally regarded as a Single Sign-On (SOS) solution. SOS systems are sold by a
	large number of vendors and include a range of technologies such as:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
		Proxy sign-on
		</p></li><li><p>
		Federated directory provisioning
		</p></li><li><p>
		Meta-directory server solutions
		</p></li><li><p>
		Replacement authentication systems
		</p></li></ul></div><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2557377"></a>
	There are really only three solutions that provide integrated authentication and
	user Identity management facilities:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
		Samba Winbind (free)
                </p></li><li><p>
		<a href="http://www.padl.com" target="_top">PADL</a> PAM and LDAP Tools (free)
                </p></li><li><p>
		<a href="http://www.vintela.com" target="_top">Vintela</a> Authentication Services (Commercial)
                </p></li></ul></div><p>
	The following guidelines are pertinent in respect of the deployment of winbind-based authentication
	and Identity resolution with the express purpose of allowing users to log onto UNIX/Linux desktops
	using Windows network Domain user credentials (username and password).
	</p><p>
	You should note that it is possible to use LDAP-based PAM and NSS tools to permit distributed
	systems logons (SSO) providing user and group accounts are stored in an LDAP directory. This
	provides logon services for UNIX/Linux users, while Windows users obtain their sign-on
	support via Samba-3.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2557438"></a>
	On the other hand, if the authentication and Identity resolution backend must be provided by
	a Windows NT4 style Domain or from an Active Directory Domain that does not have the Microsoft
	Windows Services for UNIX (SUS) installed, winbind is your best friend. Specific guidance for these
	situations now follows.
	</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2557458"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2557465"></a><a class="indexterm" name="id2557473"></a>
	To permit users to log onto a Linux system using Windows network credentials, you need to
	configure Identity resolution (NSS) and PAM. This means that the basic steps include those
	outlined above with the addition of PAM configuration. Given that most workstations (desktop/client)
	usually do not need to provide file and print services to a group of users, the configuration
	of shares and printers is generally less important. Often this allows the share specifications
	to be entirely removed from the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file. That is obviously an administrator decision.

		The addition of UNIX/Linux Samba servers and clients is a common requirement. In this chapter, you
		learned how to integrate such servers so that the UID/GID mappings they use can be consistent
		across all Domain Member servers. You also discovered how to implement the ability to use Samba
		or Windows Domain account credentials to log onto a UNIX/Linux client.
		</p><p>
		The following are key points noted:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
			Domain Controllers are always authoritative for the Domain.
			</p></li><li><p>
			Domain Members may have local accounts and must be able to resolve the identity of 
			Domain user accounts. Domain user account identity must map to a local UID/GID. That 
			local UID/GID can be stored in LDAP. This way, it is possible to share the IDMAP data 
			across all Domain Member machines.
			</p></li><li><p>
			Resolution of user and group identities on Domain Member machines may be implemented 
			using direct LDAP services or using winbind.
			</p></li><li><p>
			On NSS/PAM enabled UNIX/Linux systems, NSS is responsible for Identity management 
			and PAM is responsible for authentication of logon credentials (user name and password).

		You can use NIS for your UNIX accounts. NIS does not store the Windows encrypted
		passwords that need to be stored in one of the acceptable passdb backends.
		Your choice of backend is limited to <i class="parameter"><tt>smbpasswd</tt></i> or
		<i class="parameter"><tt>tdbsam</tt></i>. Winbind is needed to handle the resolution of
		SIDs from trusted domains to local UID/GID values.

		On a Domain Member server, you effectively map Windows Domain users to local users
		that are in your NIS database by specifying the <i class="parameter"><tt>winbind trusted domains
		only</tt></i>. This causes user and group account lookups to be routed via
		the <span><b class="command">getpwnam()</b></span> family of systems calls. On an NIS-enabled client,
		this pushes the resolution of users and groups out through NIS.
		</p><p>
		As a general rule, it is always a good idea to run winbind on all Samba servers.

		Our IT management people do not like LDAP, but are looking at Microsoft Active Directory.

		Microsoft Active Directory is an LDAP server that is intricately tied to a Kerberos
		infrastructure. Most IT managers who object to LDAP do so because of the fact that
		an LDAP server is most often supplied as a raw tool that needs to be configured, and
		for which the administrator must create the schema, create the administration tools and
		devise the backup and recovery facilities in a site dependent manner. LDAP servers
		in general are seen as a high-energy, high-risk facility.
		</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2558114"></a>
		Microsoft Active Directory by comparison is easy to install, configure, and
		is supplied with all tools necessary to implement and manage the directory. For sites
		that lack a lot of technical competence, Active Directory is a good choice. For sites
		that have the technical competence to handle Active Directory well, LDAP is a good
		alternative. The real issue that needs to be addressed is what type of solution does
		the site want? If management wants a choice to use an alternative, they may want to
		consider the options. On the other hand, if management just wants a solution that works,
		Microsoft Active Directory is a good solution.

		Many UNIX administrators mock the model that the Personal Computer industry has adopted
		as normative since the early days of Novell Netware. One may well argue that the old
		perception of the necessity to keep users off file and print servers was a result of
		fears concerning the security and integrity of data. It was a simple and generally
		effective measure to keep users away from servers, except through mapped drives.

		UNIX administrators are fully correct in asserting that UNIX servers and workstations
		are identical in terms of the software that is installed. They correctly assert that
		in a well secured environment it is safe to store files on a system that has hundreds
		of users. But all network administrators must factor into the decision to allow or
		reject general user logins to a UNIX system that is principally a file and print
		server. One must take account of the risk to operations through simple user errors.
		Only then can one begin to appraise the best strategy and adopt a site-specific
		policy that best protects the needs of users and of the organization alike.
		</p><p><a class="indexterm" name="id2558364"></a>
		From experience, it is my recommendation to keep general system level logins to a
		practical minimum and to eliminate them if possible. This should not be taken as a
		hard rule, though. The better question is, what works best for the site?

		The key benefit of using LDAP is that the UID of all users and the GID of all groups
		are globally consistent on Domain Controllers as well as on Domain Member servers.
		This means that it is possible to copy/replicate files across servers without
		loss of identity.

		When use is made of account Identity resolution via winbind, even when an IDMAP backend
		is stored in LDAP, the UID/GID on Domain Member servers is consistent, but differs
		from the ID that the user/group has on Domain Controllers. The winbind allocated UID/GID
		that is stored in LDAP (or locally) will be in the numeric range specified in the <i class="parameter"><tt>
		idmap uid/gid</tt></i> in the <tt class="filename">smb.conf</tt> file. On Domain Controllers, the UID/GID is
		that of the Posix value assigned in the LDAP directory as part of the Posix account information.

		Samba depends on correctly functioning resolution of host names to their IP address. Samba
		makes no direct DNS lookup calls, but rather redirects all name to address calls via the
		<span><b class="command">getXXXbyXXX()</b></span> function calls. The configuration of the <tt class="constant">hosts</tt>
		entry in the NSS <tt class="filename">/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt> file determines how the underlying
		resolution process is implemented. If the <tt class="constant">hosts</tt> entry in your NSS
		control file says:
</p><pre class="screen">
hosts: files dns wins
</pre><p>
		This means that a host name lookup first tries the <tt class="filename">/etc/hosts</tt>.
		If this fails to resolve, it attempts a DNS lookup and if that fails, it tries a
		WINS lookup.

		The addition of the WINS-based name lookup makes sense only if NetBIOS over TCP/IP has
		been enabled on all Windows clients. Where NetBIOS over TCP/IP has been disabled, DNS
		is the preferred name resolution technology. This usually makes most sense when Samba
		is a client of an Active Directory Domain, where NetBIOS use has been disabled. In this
		case, the Windows 200x auto-registers all locator records it needs with its own DNS
		server/s.
