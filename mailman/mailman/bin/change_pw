"""Change a list's password.

Prior to Mailman 2.1, list passwords were kept in crypt'd format -- usually.
Some Python installations didn't have the crypt module available, so they'd
fall back to md5.  Then suddenly the Python installation might grow a crypt
module and all list passwords would be broken.

In Mailman 2.1, all list and site passwords are stored in SHA1 hexdigest
form.  This breaks list passwords for all existing pre-Mailman 2.1 lists, and
since those passwords aren't stored anywhere in plain text, they cannot be
retrieved and updated.

Thus, this script generates new passwords for a list, and optionally sends it
to all the owners of the list.

Usage: change_pw [options]

Options:

    --all / -a
        Change the password for all lists.

    --domain=domain
    -d domain
        Change the password for all lists in the virtual domain `domain'.  It
        is okay to give multiple -d options.

    --listname=listname
    -l listname
        Change the password only for the named list.  It is okay to give
        multiple -l options.

    --password=newpassword
    -p newpassword
        Use the supplied plain text password `newpassword' as the new password
        for any lists that are being changed (as specified by the -a, -d, and
        -l options).  If not given, lists will be assigned a randomly
        generated new password.

    --quiet / -q
        Don't notify list owners of the new password.  You'll have to have
        some other way of letting the list owners know the new password
        (presumably out-of-band).

    --help / -h
        Print this help message and exit.
