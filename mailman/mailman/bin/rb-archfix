"""Reduce disk space usage for Pipermail archives.

Usage: %(PROGRAM)s [options] file ...

Where options are:
    -h / --help
        Print this help message and exit.

Only use this to 'fix' archive -article database files that have been written
with Mailman 2.1.3 or earlier and have html_body attributes in them.  These
attributes can cause huge amounts of memory bloat and impact performance for
high activity lists, particularly those where large text postings are made to
them.

Example:

%% ls -1 archives/private/*/database/*-article | xargs %(PROGRAM)s

You should run `bin/check_perms -f' after running this script.

You will probably want to delete the -article.bak files created by this script
when you are satisfied with the results.

This script is provided for convenience purposes only.  It isn't supported.
