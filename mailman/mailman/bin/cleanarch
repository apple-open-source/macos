"""Clean up an .mbox archive file.

The archiver looks for Unix-From lines separating messages in an mbox archive
file.  For compatibility, it specifically looks for lines that start with
"From " -- i.e. the letters capital-F, lowercase-r, o, m, space, ignoring
everything else on the line.

Normally, any lines that start "From " in the body of a message should be
escaped such that a > character is actually the first on a line.  It is
possible though that body lines are not actually escaped.  This script
attempts to fix these by doing a stricter test of the Unix-From lines.  Any
lines that start "From " but do not pass this stricter test are escaped with a
> character.

Usage: cleanarch [options] < inputfile > outputfile
Options:
    -s n
    --status=n
        Print a # character every n lines processed

    -q / --quiet
        Don't print changed line information to standard error.

    -n / --dry-run
        Don't actually output anything.

    -h / --help
        Print this message and exit
