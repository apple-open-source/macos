# 1 - Remove any embedded text/html parts, leaving them as HTML-escaped

#     simply HTML-escaped.
# 2 - Leave it inline, but HTML-escape it
# 3 - Remove text/html as attachments but don't HTML-escape them. Note: this
#     is very dangerous because it essentially means anybody can send an HTML
#     email to your site containing evil JavaScript or web bugs, or other
#     nasty things, and folks viewing your archives will be susceptible.  You
#     should only consider this option if you do heavy moderation of your list

# Note: given the current archiving code, it is not possible to leave

# to do anyway.
#
# The value can also be a string, in which case it is the name of a command to
# filter the HTML page through.  The resulting output is left in an attachment
# or as the entirety of the message when the outer part is text/html.  The
# format of the string must include a "%(filename)s" which will contain the

# Authentication contexts.

# Mailman defines the following roles:

# - User, a normal user who has no permissions except to change their personal
#   option settings
# - List creator, someone who can create and delete lists, but cannot
#   (necessarily) configure the list.
# - List moderator, someone who can tend to pending requests such as
#   subscription requests, or held messages
# - List administrator, someone who has total control over a list, can
#   configure it, modify user options for members of the list, subscribe and
#   unsubscribe members, etc.
# - Site administrator, someone who has total control over the entire site and
#   can do any of the tasks mentioned above.  This person usually also has
#   command line access.
