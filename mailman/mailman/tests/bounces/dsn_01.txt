Otto,

Thanks for the reply.  I remembered hearing of this PyUnit but had lost 
track of it for a while.  I just visited the sourceforge homepage:

http://pyunit.sourceforge.net/pyunit.html

I'm pretty sure that PyUnit [as its coded to Python 1.5.2] should be 
workable with JPython, but the web page says:

"""
PyUnit cannot be used with JPython, the users of which should probably use 
JUnit and create JPython subclasses of its TestCase class. I haven't tried 
doing this.
"""

Now, I don't see why this would be the case, so I'm going to download PyUnit 
and sniff around.  Are any of these modifications you mentioned to get 
PyUnit running under JPython published on the Web anywhere?  I'd like to 
take a look, as they would probably save me some time.

Thanks again,

James
