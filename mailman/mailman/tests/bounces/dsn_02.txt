It's hard to tell for sure, but that was my guess too.  In array languages,
this kind of thing is ubiquitous and is often called "scalar broadcast"
(where a scalar is any atomic value (as opposed to an array), and is
"broadcast" to every position of the arrays in which it's combined via some
operation).

There was a long debate about this a few years ago on c.l.py, where I
championed scalar broadcast in map specifically.  It collapsed under its own
hideous weight when-- as such things always do <wink> --that originally
modest goal got hijacked by people seeking to extend the semantics to every
corner of the language.  That won't happen.

That is a problem!  Kinda.  Mostly people want to broadcast numbers (as in
Franz's original example), and there's no problem there.  A cheap workaround
for sequences that are desired to be treated as scalars would have been to
introduce a new builtin scalar() function, that simply hid the
"sequenceness" of its argument from map.

Note that the listcomps in 2.0 make scalar broadcast much easier to spell;
e.g.

    [replace(x, "c", "C") for x in ("abc", "cde")]
    [x**2 + 5 for x in L]

So the better solution is not to extend map, but to forget it <0.9 wink>.
