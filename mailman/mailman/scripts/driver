# The driver script prints out a lot of information when a Mailman bug is
# encountered.  This really helps for development, but it also reveals
# information about the host system that some administrators are not
# comfortable with.  By setting STEALTH_MODE to 1, you disable the printing of
# this information to the web pages.  This information is still, and always,
# printed in the error logs.

# This standard driver script is used to run CGI programs, wrapped in code
# that catches errors, and displays them as HTML.  This guarantees that
# (almost) any problem in the Mailman software doesn't result in a Web server
# error.  It is much more helpful to generate and show a traceback, which the
# user could send to the administrator, than to display a server error and
# have to trudge through server logs.

# Note: this isn't 100% perfect!  Here are some things that can go wrong that
# are not caught and reported as traceback-containing HTML:
#
# - This file could contain a syntax error.  In that case, you would indeed
#   get a Web server error since this file wouldn't even compile, and there's
#   no way to catch that.  Mailman's install procedure should make this highly
#   unlikely.
#
# - The os or sys modules could be royally screwed, probably we couldn't
#   import one or both of them.  This would indicate a serious problem with
#   the Python installation, so it's also highly unlikely to occur.
