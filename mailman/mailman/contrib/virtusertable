## My server's hostname is nospam, but we don't honor that as a
## Mailman mail domain. Anything @nospam.uchicago.edu should be
## forwarded to our master Mailman admin address.
##
@nospam.uchicago.edu			mailman-owner@midway.uchicago.edu

##
## Redirect mail to the standard Mailman admin addresses to the
## master admin address. (Midway.uchicago.edu is our site's central
## mail-routing server, and it carries aliases for maintenance groups.
## Not a good plan to entrust Mailman maintenance mail to Mailman.)
##
mailman@listhost.uchicago.edu		mailman-owner@midway.uchicago.edu
mailman-owner@listhost.uchicago.edu	mailman-owner@midway.uchicago.edu

##
## These addresses are required or recommended either by convention
## or by RFC 2142, "Mailbox Names for Common Services, Roles and
## Functions". Honor them.
